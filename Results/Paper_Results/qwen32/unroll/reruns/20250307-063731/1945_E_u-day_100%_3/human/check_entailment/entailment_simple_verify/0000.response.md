### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if it correctly meets the requirements.

**Problem Requirements:**
- We need to rearrange the permutation `p` using up to 2 swaps.
- After the rearrangement, a binary search should correctly identify the position of `x` such that `p_l` equals `x`.

**Program Analysis:**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the following reasons:

1. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The binary search is performed on the unsorted permutation `p`.
   - The binary search algorithm assumes that the array is sorted, which is not the case here.
   - The variable `low` after the binary search loop represents the position where `x` could be if the array were sorted, but it does not guarantee that `arr[low]` equals `x`.

2. **Swapping Logic:**
   - The program checks if `arr[low]` equals `x` after the binary search.
   - If `arr[low]` is not `x`, it performs a single swap between `low + 1` and `pos + 1` (where `pos` is the index of `x` in the original array).
   - This single swap may not be sufficient to ensure that `p_l` equals `x` after the binary search.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the array is not easily rearranged with just one swap.
   - The problem guarantees that two swaps are always sufficient, but the provided code only attempts one swap in most cases.

**Counterexample:**
Consider the test case:
```
1
5 3
5 4 3 2 1
```
- The target `x` is `3`.
- The initial array is `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.
- Binary search will not correctly identify `3` as `p_l` because the array is not sorted.
- The code will attempt to swap the position found by binary search (which would be incorrect due to the unsorted nature of the array) with the actual position of `3`.

**Correct Approach:**
To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
1. Identify the position `pos` of `x` in the array.
2. Use up to two swaps to rearrange the array such that `p_l` equals `x` after the binary search.
3. Ensure that the binary search will correctly identify `x` after the rearrangement.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Final: False**
