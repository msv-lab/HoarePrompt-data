#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature. The function `func_1` does not take any parameters and returns a map object that is the result of applying `int` to each element of the input split by spaces.
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that applies the `int` function to each element of the input string split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into substrings separated by spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters in its signature, so there are no variables to describe. The function `func_2` is dependent on the output of `func_1`, but based on the provided signature, no precondition can be derived from the variables.
def func_2():
    return list(func_1())
    #The program returns a list that is the output of `func_1()`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It returns a list that is the output of `func_1()`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, k is an integer representing the number to be found in the permutation, arr is a list of integers of length n representing the permutation.
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found.
    low, high = 0, n
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: 
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: low + 1, pos + 1 (where low is an index within the bounds of the list `arr` and pos is an undefined variable)
    #State: `arr` is a list, `low` is an index within the bounds of `arr`, and `k` is a value. If the current value of `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, then `arr[low]` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines the position of a specified integer `k` in a list `arr` of length `n`. It prints `0` if `k` is found at the position indicated by a binary search, otherwise it prints `1` followed by the index where `k` would be inserted to maintain order and the last occurrence index of `k` in the list, if `k` is present.
