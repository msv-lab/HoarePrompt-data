You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

#Function 1:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find a number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using binary search, but the array is not sorted.
- We can perform up to 2 swaps to make the binary search work correctly.
- The binary search algorithm is given, and we need to ensure that `p[low]` equals `x` after the search.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`, and then reads the permutation `p`.

2. **Finding the Position of `x`**:
   - The program iterates through the permutation to find the index `pos` where `arr[pos] == x`.

3. **Binary Search Simulation**:
   - The program initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `n`.
   - It then performs a binary search to find the position `low` where the binary search would stop.
   - During the search, it keeps track of the midpoints in a set `st` (though this set is not used further).

4. **Determining the Output**:
   - If `arr[low] == x`, the program prints `0` (no swaps needed).
   - Otherwise, it prints `1` and suggests swapping the elements at positions `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search logic is correct in terms of finding the stopping point `low` where the search would end.
   - However, the program does not correctly handle the case where `x` is not found at `arr[low]` after the binary search. It simply suggests a swap without ensuring that the swap will lead to `arr[low] == x` after the binary search.

2. **Handling of Swaps**:
   - The program suggests a single swap, but it doesn't guarantee that this swap will make `arr[low] == x` after the binary search.
   - The problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient, but the program only considers 1 swap and doesn't handle the case where 2 swaps are needed.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where multiple elements in the permutation are equal to `x` or where `x` is not present in the permutation.
   - The program does not consider the possibility of using 2 swaps to achieve the desired result.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the program does not always produce the correct output as per the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
