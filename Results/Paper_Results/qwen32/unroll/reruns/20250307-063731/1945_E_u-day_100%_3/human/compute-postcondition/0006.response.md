The code snippet provided initializes a new set named `st`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, or `high`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initialization of `st` while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is an empty set.**
