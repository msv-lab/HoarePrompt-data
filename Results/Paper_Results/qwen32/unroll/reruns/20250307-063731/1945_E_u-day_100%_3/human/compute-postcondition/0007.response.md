To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition `low + 1 < high`. The variables `low` and `high` are the only ones that can be adjusted according to the loop head.

Given:
- `low` is 0
- `high` is `n`

The loop will execute if `low + 1 < high`. Substituting the values, we get `0 + 1 < n`, which simplifies to `1 < n`.

Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `st`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `low` is 0, `high` is `n` and `n` must be greater than 1, `st` is an empty set**
