The code `n, k = func_1()` assigns the return values of `func_1()` to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, and `k` is an integer representing the number to be found in the permutation. The value of `arr` is not affected by this code snippet.

Since the specific values returned by `func_1()` are not provided, we can only state that after the execution of the code, `n` and `k` will hold the values returned by `func_1()`. The other variable `arr` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers of length `n` representing the permutation.**
