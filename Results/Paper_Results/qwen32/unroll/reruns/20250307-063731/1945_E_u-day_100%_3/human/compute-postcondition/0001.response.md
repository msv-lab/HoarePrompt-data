The code snippet `arr = func_2()` assigns the return value of `func_2()` to the variable `arr`. This means that the previous value of `arr` is replaced by the new value returned by `func_2()`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the execution of `func_2()`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`.**
