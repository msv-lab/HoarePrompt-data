To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Variables and their states:**
   - `arr` is a list.
   - `low` is an index within the bounds of `arr`.
   - `k` is a value.
   - `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.

2. **Print statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(low + 1, pos + 1)`.
   - This means we need to know the values of `low` and `pos`.

3. **Analysis of the variables:**
   - `low` is explicitly mentioned as an index within the bounds of `arr`, but its exact value is not given.
   - `k` is a value, but its exact value is not given.
   - `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, but this does not provide any information about the value of `low`.
   - `pos` is not mentioned in the initial state, so its value is unknown.

Since `pos` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value from the given information. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of `low` and `pos`.

**Output Description:**
The code prints `low + 1` and `pos + 1`. Here, `low` is an index within the bounds of the list `arr`, and `pos` is a variable whose value is not provided in the initial state.

Output: **low + 1, pos + 1 (where low is an index within the bounds of the list `arr` and pos is an undefined variable)**
