To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's analyze the code:

1. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`.
2. In each iteration, it checks if the element at index `i` in the array `arr` is equal to `k`.
3. If the condition is met, it updates the variable `pos` to the current index `i`.
4. The loop continues to the next iteration until all elements in `arr` are checked.

After the loop finishes, the variable `pos` will hold the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`. If `k` is not found in `arr`, `pos` will remain -1.

Given that the only variables affected by the loop are `pos` and the loop index `i` (which is not part of the output state), the output state will be:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found.**
