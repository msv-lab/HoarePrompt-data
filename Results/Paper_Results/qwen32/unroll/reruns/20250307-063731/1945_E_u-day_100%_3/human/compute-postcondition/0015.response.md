Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the length of the permutation; `k`, an integer representing the number to be found in the permutation; and `arr`, a list of integers of length `n` representing the permutation. The function returns the index of the number `k` in the permutation list `arr`.**
