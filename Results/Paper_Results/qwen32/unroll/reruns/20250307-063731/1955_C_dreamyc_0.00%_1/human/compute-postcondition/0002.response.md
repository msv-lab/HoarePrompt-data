To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that both conditions in the loop head are satisfied:

1. `k` must be non-zero.
2. The length of `nums` must be at least 2.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15.
- `nums` is a deque of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.
- `ans` is 0.

We need to adjust the states of `k` and `nums`:
- `k` must be greater than 0 (it already satisfies 1 <= k <= 10^15, so no change needed here).
- `nums` must have at least 2 elements. Since `n` satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2.

The state of `t` and the individual values in `nums` do not affect whether the loop can execute its first iteration, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the adjusted state should ensure that `n` (the length of `nums`) is at least 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `ans` is 0**
