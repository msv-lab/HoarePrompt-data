### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem as described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and whether it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of ships) and `k` (number of attacks).
   - It then reads the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with `n`, `k`, and `nums` as arguments.
   - Inside `func_1`, `nums` is converted to a `deque` for efficient popping from both ends.
   - The variable `ans` keeps track of the number of ships sunk.

3. **Simulating the Kraken's Attacks:**
   - The program enters a loop that continues as long as `k` is greater than 0 and there are at least two ships left (`len(nums) >= 2`).
   - In each iteration, it removes the first (`a`) and last (`b`) ships from `nums`.
   - It calculates the minimum durability (`x`) between the two ships.
   - If `k` is at least `2 * x`, it means the Kraken can fully sink both ships in `2 * x` attacks:
     - It reduces the durability of both ships by `x` and decreases `k` by `2 * x`.
     - If the durability of either ship is still greater than 0 after the attack, it is added back to `nums`.
     - Otherwise, it increments `ans` to count the sunk ship.
   - If `k` is less than `2 * x`, it breaks out of the loop as the Kraken cannot sink both ships completely in the remaining attacks.

4. **Handling the Last Remaining Ship:**
   - After the loop, if `k` is still greater than 0, and there is exactly one ship left in `nums`, and `k` is at least as large as the durability of that ship, it means the Kraken can sink the last ship:
     - It increments `ans` by 1 to count the sunk ship.
   - The function returns `ans`, which is the total number of ships sunk.

5. **Correctness:**
   - The program correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks by alternating between the first and last ships.
   - It properly accounts for the durability of each ship and reduces it by 1 for each attack.
   - It correctly counts the number of ships that are fully sunk.
   - The edge case where there is only one ship left is also handled correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
