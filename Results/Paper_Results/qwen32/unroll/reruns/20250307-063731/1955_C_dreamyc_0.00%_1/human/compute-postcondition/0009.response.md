Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes a list of integers `nums` with a given integer `k`. It modifies the list by repeatedly removing the smallest and largest elements, reducing `k` by twice the smaller element's value, and adjusting the list accordingly. The function returns the count of elements that are fully removed from the list plus one if there is a single remaining element that can be fully removed with the remaining `k`.**
