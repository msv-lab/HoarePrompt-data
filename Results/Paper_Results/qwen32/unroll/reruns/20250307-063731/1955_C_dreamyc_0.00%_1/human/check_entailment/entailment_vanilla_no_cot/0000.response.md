Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases, particularly when the Kraken attacks the remaining ships after some ships have already sunk. The main issue is that the program does not account for the scenario where the Kraken attacks the same ship multiple times consecutively when there is only one ship left or when there are two ships left with different durability values.

Let's consider the following test case:

```
1
2 5
1 1
```

In this case, the Kraken should sink both ships. However, the program will only sink one ship and leave the other with zero durability but not count it as sunk.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the current program does for the above test case:

1. The Kraken attacks the first ship (durability becomes 0), and the list becomes `[1]`.
2. The Kraken attacks the last ship (which is the only ship left, durability becomes 0), and the list becomes `[]`.
3. The Kraken still has 3 attacks left, but there are no ships left to attack, so the program returns 1 (only one ship is counted as sunk).

The correct behavior should be to count both ships as sunk.

To fix the program, we need to ensure that after attacking the first and last ships, we check if they are completely sunk and remove them from the deque. We also need to handle the case where there is only one ship left correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
from collections import deque

def func_1(n, k, nums):
    nums = deque(nums)
    ans = 0
    while k and nums:
        if len(nums) == 1:
            # If there's only one ship left, attack it directly
            if k >= nums[0]:
                ans += 1
                k -= nums[0]
                nums.pop()
            else:
                nums[0] -= k
                k = 0
        else:
            # Attack the first and last ships
            a = nums.popleft()
            b = nums.pop()
            x = min(a, b)
            if k >= 2 * x:
                a -= x
                b -= x
                k -= 2 * x
            else:
                break
            if a > 0:
                nums.appendleft(a)
            else:
                ans += 1
            if b > 0:
                nums.append(b)
            else:
                ans += 1
    return ans

# Main code remains the same
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ans = func_1(n, k, nums)
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version ensures that the Kraken attacks the remaining ships correctly and counts all ships that are sunk.
