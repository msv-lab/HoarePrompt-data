#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15. nums is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    nums = deque(nums)
    ans = 0
    while k and len(nums) >= 2:
        a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()
        
        x = min(a, b)
        
        if k >= 2 * x:
            a -= x
            b -= x
            k -= 2 * x
        else:
            break
        
        if a > 0:
            nums.appendleft(a)
        else:
            ans += 1
        
        if b > 0:
            nums.append(b)
        else:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: nums = deque([1]), k = 4, ans = 2.
    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns 3
    #State: `nums` is a deque containing the single element 1, `k` is 4, `ans` is 2, and either `k` is 0, or the length of `nums` is not 1, or `k` is less than the first element of `nums`.
    return ans
    #The program returns 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a list of integers `nums` with a given integer `k`. It modifies the list by repeatedly removing the smallest and largest elements, reducing `k` by twice the smaller element's value, and adjusting the list accordingly. The function returns the count of elements that are fully removed from the list plus one if there is a single remaining element that can be fully removed with the remaining `k`.
