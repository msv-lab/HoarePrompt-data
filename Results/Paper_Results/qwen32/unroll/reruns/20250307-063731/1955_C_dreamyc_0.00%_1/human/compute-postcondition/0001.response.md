The given Python code snippet initializes a variable `ans` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`) are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15. `nums` is a deque of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `ans` is 0.**
