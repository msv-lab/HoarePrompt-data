You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The Kraken attacks ships in a specific order: first, the first ship, then the last ship, and repeats this pattern. Each attack reduces the durability of the ship by 1. If a ship's durability drops to 0, it sinks and is no longer attacked. The process continues until either all ships have sunk or the Kraken has made all its attacks.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program uses a deque (double-ended queue) to efficiently access and modify the first and last elements of the list of ships' durability. Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`. It also reads the list of ships' durability `nums`.

2. **Main Loop**: The program enters a loop that continues as long as there are attacks left (`k > 0`) and there are at least two ships (`len(nums) >= 2`):
   - It pops the first and last ship's durability from the deque (`a = nums.popleft()`, `b = nums.pop()`).
   - It calculates the minimum durability of the two ships (`x = min(a, b)`).
   - If the Kraken has enough attacks to sink both ships (`k >= 2 * x`), it reduces the durability of both ships by `x` and decreases the number of remaining attacks by `2 * x`.
   - If the durability of either ship is greater than 0 after the attack, it is appended back to the deque. Otherwise, it is considered sunk, and the count of sunk ships (`ans`) is incremented.

3. **Single Ship Case**: After the main loop, if there is one ship left (`len(nums) == 1`) and the Kraken has enough attacks to sink it (`k >= nums[0]`), the program increments the count of sunk ships by 1.

4. **Output**: The program prints the number of sunk ships for each test case.

### Correctness Verification:
- The program correctly handles the scenario where the Kraken attacks the first and last ships alternately.
- It efficiently uses a deque to manage the list of ships, which allows for O(1) time complexity for popping and appending elements from both ends.
- The program correctly counts the number of sunk ships based on the given conditions.
- The program handles edge cases, such as when there is only one ship or when the Kraken has more attacks than needed to sink all ships.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It correctly calculates the number of ships sunk by the Kraken after all attacks.

Correctness: **True**
