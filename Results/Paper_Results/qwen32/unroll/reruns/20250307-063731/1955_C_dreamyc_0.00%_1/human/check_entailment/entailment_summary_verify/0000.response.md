To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's systematically analyze the problem description, the code, and the function summary.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **n** ships, each with a durability **a_i**.
- The Kraken attacks the ships **k** times in an alternating pattern: first the first ship, then the last, then the first again, and so on.
- Each attack reduces the durability of the ship by 1.
- When a ship's durability drops to 0, it sinks and is no longer attacked.
- The task is to determine how many ships sink after **k** attacks.

### Code Analysis:
The code uses a `deque` to efficiently manage the list of ships and their durability. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Read the number of test cases **T**.
   - For each test case, read **n** (number of ships) and **k** (number of attacks).
   - Read the list of durabilities **nums**.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - Convert **nums** to a `deque` for efficient popping from both ends.
   - Initialize **ans** to 0, which will count the number of sunk ships.

3. **Attacking Ships:**
   - While there are still attacks left (**k > 0**) and there are at least two ships left:
     - Pop the first and last ship from the `deque` and store their durabilities in **a** and **b**.
     - Determine the minimum durability **x** between the two ships.
     - If there are enough attacks to sink both ships (**k >= 2 * x**):
       - Reduce the durability of both ships by **x**.
       - Decrease the number of attacks by **2 * x**.
     - Otherwise, break out of the loop.
     - If the first ship's durability is still greater than 0, append it back to the `deque`; otherwise, increment the sunk ship counter **ans**.
     - Similarly, handle the last ship.
   - If there is one ship left and enough attacks to sink it (**k >= nums[0]**), increment the sunk ship counter **ans** by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - Print the number of sunk ships for each test case.

### Function Summary:
The function `func_1` processes a list of integers `nums` with a given integer `k`. It modifies the list by repeatedly removing the smallest and largest elements, reducing `k` by twice the smaller element's value, and adjusting the list accordingly. The function returns the count of elements that are fully removed from the list plus one if there is a single remaining element that can be fully removed with the remaining `k`.

### Verification:
- **Correctness of Alternating Attacks:**
  - The code correctly alternates between attacking the first and last ship.
  - It reduces the durability of the ships based on the number of attacks.
  
- **Handling Edge Cases:**
  - When there is only one ship left, the code checks if the remaining attacks are sufficient to sink it.
  - If the number of attacks is less than the number of ships, the code correctly handles this scenario.
  
- **Efficiency:**
  - The use of a `deque` ensures that popping from both ends is efficient, which is crucial given the constraints.

### Testing with Example:
Let's verify the code with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `n=4`, `k=5`, `a=[1, 2, 4, 3]`
  - Output: `2`
  - Explanation: The first ship sinks after 1 attack, the last ship after 1 attack, the first again after 1 attack, the last after 1 attack, and the first again after 1 attack. Total 2 ships sink.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `n=4`, `k=6`, `a=[1, 2, 4, 3]`
  - Output: `3`
  - Explanation: The first ship sinks after 1 attack, the last ship after 1 attack, the first again after 1 attack, the last after 1 attack, the first again after 1 attack, and the last again after 1 attack. Total 3 ships sink.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `n=5`, `k=20`, `a=[2, 7, 1, 8, 2]`
  - Output: `5`
  - Explanation: All ships will sink given the number of attacks.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `n=2`, `k=2`, `a=[3, 2]`
  - Output: `0`
  - Explanation: Not enough attacks to sink any ship.

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `n=2`, `k=15`, `a=[1, 5]`
  - Output: `2`
  - Explanation: Both ships will sink given the number of attacks.

- **Test Case 6:**
  - Input: `n=2`, `k=7`, `a=[5, 2]`
  - Output: `2`
  - Explanation: Both ships will sink given the number of attacks.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases. It handles the alternating attack pattern, efficiently reduces the durability of the ships, and correctly counts the number of sunk ships.

### Final Evaluation:
**Final: True**
