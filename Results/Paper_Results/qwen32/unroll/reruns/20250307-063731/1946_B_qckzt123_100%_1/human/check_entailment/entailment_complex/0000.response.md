### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the described problem by processing multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations. Here's a breakdown of the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `a`.

2. **Calculating Initial Sum (`s`):**
   - The program calculates the sum of the array `a` and stores it in `s`.

3. **Finding Maximum Non-negative Subarray Sum (`t`):**
   - The program uses Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum non-negative subarray sum in `a`. This is stored in `t`.

4. **Calculating the Result (`ans`):**
   - The initial result `ans` is calculated as `(s + t) % MOD`.
   - The program then performs `k - 1` operations where it doubles the value of `t` and adds it to `ans`, taking the result modulo `MOD` after each operation.

5. **Output:**
   - The final result for each test case is printed.

### Analysis:

- **Kadane's Algorithm:** This correctly finds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray which is non-negative. If all elements are negative, `t` will be `0`.
- **Sum Calculation (`s`):** The sum of all elements in the array is correctly calculated.
- **Doubling `t`:** The logic of doubling `t` and adding it to `ans` for `k - 1` operations is correct because each operation can be thought of as inserting the maximum non-negative subarray sum (or `0` if all elements are negative) into the array, effectively doubling the contribution of `t` in the final sum after each operation.
- **Modulo Operation:** The modulo operation is correctly applied to ensure the result does not exceed the required limit.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, and it handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
