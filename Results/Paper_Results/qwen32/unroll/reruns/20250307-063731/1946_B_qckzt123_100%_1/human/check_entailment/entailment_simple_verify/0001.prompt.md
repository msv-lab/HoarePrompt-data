You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem and the solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the sum of an array after performing `k` operations. Each operation allows us to select any contiguous subarray, compute its sum, and insert this sum anywhere in the array. The final sum should be taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Key Observations

1. **Maximizing the Sum:**
   - The best strategy to maximize the sum is to repeatedly add the maximum possible subarray sum to the array. This is because adding a positive number (or zero) will only increase the total sum.
   - The maximum subarray sum can be found using Kadane's algorithm, which efficiently computes the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in linear time.

2. **Efficient Calculation:**
   - After finding the maximum subarray sum (let's call it `t`), the strategy is to double this sum in each subsequent operation. This is because the best way to maximize the sum is to keep adding the maximum possible value, and each operation can effectively double the previous best addition (if we choose the entire array as the subarray).
   - The sum of the array after `k` operations can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{ans} = \text{original\_sum} + t + 2t + 4t + \ldots + 2^{k-1}t
     \]
     This is a geometric series and can be simplified to:
     \[
     \text{ans} = \text{original\_sum} + t \times (2^k - 1)
     \]

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Since the result can be very large, the final answer is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program and check if it aligns with the above observations:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of operations `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a` of `n` integers.

2. **Finding the Maximum Subarray Sum:**
   - The program uses a loop to compute the maximum subarray sum using a variation of Kadane's algorithm. It maintains a running sum `tmp` and updates the maximum sum `t` if `tmp` exceeds `t`. If `tmp` becomes negative, it resets `tmp` to zero.

3. **Calculating the Final Sum:**
   - The program initializes `ans` with the sum of the original array plus the maximum subarray sum `t`.
   - It then iterates `k-1` times, doubling `t` in each iteration and adding it to `ans`, taking modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) at each step to prevent overflow.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final result `ans` for each test case.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations. It efficiently computes the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm and correctly handles the geometric series sum with modulo operations.

Therefore, the program is correct.
