### Reasoning:

The given problem involves finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing a specified number of operations. Each operation allows you to select any contiguous subarray, compute its sum, and insert this sum anywhere in the array. The goal is to maximize the final sum of the array modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The provided program uses the following approach to solve the problem:

1. **Sum Calculation**: It calculates the sum of the array `s`.
2. **Maximum Subarray Sum**: It calculates the maximum non-negative subarray sum `t` using Kadane's algorithm.
3. **Initial Answer Calculation**: The initial answer is computed as `ans = (s + t) % MOD`.
4. **Operation Application**: For the remaining \(k-1\) operations, it doubles the maximum subarray sum `t` in each iteration and adds it to `ans`, taking modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at each step.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

- **Sum of the Array (`s`)**: Adding the entire array sum to the answer is intuitive because the sum of the array is a part of the final sum regardless of operations.
- **Maximum Non-Negative Subarray Sum (`t`)**: This value represents the best possible subarray sum that can be reused and added multiple times. Doubling `t` in each of the remaining \(k-1\) operations effectively maximizes the contribution of the subarray sum to the final sum.
- **Modulo Operation**: All operations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure the result fits within the required constraints.

The program correctly implements this strategy, and the provided execution summary aligns with the described logic. The program processes multiple test cases and correctly computes the final answer for each test case based on the described approach.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning and the alignment of the program's logic with the problem's requirements, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
