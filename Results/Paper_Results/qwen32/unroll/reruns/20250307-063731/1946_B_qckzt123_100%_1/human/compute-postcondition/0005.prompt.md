You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^9 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n and k across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
        
        s = sum(a)
        
        t, tmp = 0, 0
        
        for x in a:
            tmp += x
            if tmp < 0:
                tmp = 0
            t = max(tmp, t)
        
        ans = ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD
        
        for i in range(k - 1):
            t *= 2
            t %= MOD
            ans += t
            ans %= MOD
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: - The variable `T` remains unchanged as it is the number of test cases.
    #   - The variable `t` is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration and is not retained across iterations.
    #   - The variables `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, `tmp`, and `ans` hold the values from the last test case processed.
    #
    #Given the above analysis, the final state of the variables after all iterations is:
    #
    #- `T` remains the same as the initial state.
    #- `t` is 0 because it is reset at the start of each iteration.
    #- `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, `tmp`, and `ans` hold the values from the last test case.
    #
    #Therefore, the output state is:
    #
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of elements in a list, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the list `a`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
