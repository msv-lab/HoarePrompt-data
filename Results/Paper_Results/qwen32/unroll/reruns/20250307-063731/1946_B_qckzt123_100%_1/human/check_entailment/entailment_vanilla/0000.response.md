To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem and the solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the sum of an array after performing `k` operations. Each operation allows us to select any contiguous subarray, compute its sum, and insert this sum anywhere in the array. The final sum should be taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Key Observations

1. **Maximizing the Sum:**
   - The best strategy to maximize the sum is to repeatedly add the maximum possible subarray sum to the array. This is because adding a positive number (or zero) will only increase the total sum.
   - The maximum subarray sum can be found using Kadane's algorithm, which efficiently computes the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in linear time.

2. **Efficient Calculation:**
   - After finding the maximum subarray sum (let's call it `t`), the strategy is to double this sum in each subsequent operation. This is because the best way to maximize the sum is to keep adding the maximum possible value, and each operation can effectively double the previous best addition (if we choose the entire array as the subarray).
   - The sum of the array after `k` operations can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{ans} = \text{original\_sum} + t + 2t + 4t + \ldots + 2^{k-1}t
     \]
     This is a geometric series and can be simplified to:
     \[
     \text{ans} = \text{original\_sum} + t \times (2^k - 1)
     \]

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Since the result can be very large, the final answer is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program and check if it aligns with the above observations:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of operations `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a` of `n` integers.

2. **Finding the Maximum Subarray Sum:**
   - The program uses a loop to compute the maximum subarray sum using a variation of Kadane's algorithm. It maintains a running sum `tmp` and updates the maximum sum `t` if `tmp` exceeds `t`. If `tmp` becomes negative, it resets `tmp` to zero.

3. **Calculating the Final Sum:**
   - The program initializes `ans` with the sum of the original array plus the maximum subarray sum `t`.
   - It then iterates `k-1` times, doubling `t` in each iteration and adding it to `ans`, taking modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) at each step to prevent overflow.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final result `ans` for each test case.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations. It efficiently computes the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm and correctly handles the geometric series sum with modulo operations.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
