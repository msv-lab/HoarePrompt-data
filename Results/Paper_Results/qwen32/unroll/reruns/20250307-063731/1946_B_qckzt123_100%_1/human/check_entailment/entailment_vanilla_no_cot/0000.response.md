Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations, as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Sum Calculation (`s`)**: It calculates the sum of the array `a` and stores it in `s`. This is because one of the best strategies is to keep adding the maximum positive sum subarray to the array.

2. **Maximum Positive Subarray Sum (`t`)**: It calculates the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray using Kadane's algorithm. This value is stored in `t`.

3. **Initial Answer (`ans`)**: The initial answer is calculated as `(s + t) % MOD`. This accounts for the initial sum of the array plus the maximum positive subarray sum we can add.

4. **Doubling the Maximum Positive Subarray Sum**: For each of the remaining `k-1` operations, the maximum positive subarray sum `t` is doubled and added to `ans`. The reason for doubling is that the maximum positive subarray sum can be added to the array in such a way that it effectively doubles the previous maximum positive sum that was added.

5. **Modulo Operation**: After each addition, the result is taken modulo `10^9 + 7` to ensure that the result does not overflow and remains within the required constraints.

The program efficiently handles the constraints and edge cases, such as when the array contains all negative numbers, by ensuring that the sum is taken modulo `10^9 + 7` and by correctly handling the doubling of the maximum positive subarray sum. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
