The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of piles and the number of stones in each pile. For each test case, it determines the winner of a game where players take turns removing stones from piles, with the rule that a player can only remove stones if the number of stones in the pile is more than one greater than the next pile. The function prints 'Alice' if Alice wins and 'Bob' if Bob wins.
