To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `tc > 0` is satisfied. The variable `tc` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it depends on the user input.

Given the loop condition `while tc > 0:`, the loop will execute if `tc` is greater than 0. Therefore, we need to adjust the state so that `tc` is a positive integer.

Since the state right before the loop is that `tc` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, we need to ensure that the input provided to `int(input())` results in a value greater than 0.

State: **`tc` is assigned the value of `int(input())` and `tc` must be greater than 0**
