You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    4 2 2

Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific integer value based on the given number of vertices (`n`), the number of chosen vertices (`x`), a limit (`y`), and the list of chosen vertices. The value is derived from the gaps between the chosen vertices and the limit `y`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake by choosing up to `y` additional vertices from a regular polygon with `n` sides. Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices. The goal is to determine the maximum number of triangular pieces that can be formed with these vertices and the additional ones.

### Solution Analysis
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem as follows:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by the list of `x` vertices chosen by Bessie.

2. **Sorting and Preprocessing:**
   - The vertices are sorted.
   - A new vertex `n + l[0]` is appended to the list to handle the circular nature of the polygon.
   - The differences between consecutive vertices are calculated and stored in `val`.

3. **Sorting Differences:**
   - The differences are sorted based on two criteria:
     - First, by whether the difference is even or odd (even differences come first).
     - Second, by the value of the difference itself.

4. **Calculating Triangles:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted differences and calculates the number of triangles that can be formed.
   - For each difference `i`, it calculates `c = i // 2`, which represents the number of triangles that can be formed with that gap.
   - If `y` (the number of additional vertices available) is less than `c`, it adds `y * 2` to the total number of triangles (`sx`) and breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it adds `i` to `sx` and subtracts `c` from `y`.

5. **Calculating the Result:**
   - The final result is calculated as `cons = x + sx - 2`.

### Issues in the Solution
The provided solution has some logical flaws:
- **Handling of Circular Nature:** The program appends `n + l[0]` to handle the circular nature of the polygon, but it does not correctly account for the circular gaps between the last and first vertex.
- **Sorting Criteria:** The sorting criteria `(1 - x & 1, x)` is not clear and does not seem to correctly prioritize the differences for maximizing triangles.
- **Calculation of Triangles:** The logic for calculating the number of triangles and using the available vertices (`y`) is incorrect. The program does not properly account for the fact that adding a vertex can potentially form more than one triangle with the existing gaps.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified in the solution, the program is not correct. It does not correctly calculate the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.
