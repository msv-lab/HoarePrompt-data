The code snippet provided reads a single integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of vertices) are not affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state, `t` was an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. After executing the code, `t` is now assigned the specific integer value read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value read from the input, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer.**
