You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed. Let's analyze the program step-by-step and identify the issues.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Sorting and Calculation Logic**:
   - The program sorts the gaps between the chosen vertices (`val` list). The logic used to calculate the number of triangles is flawed.
   - The program sorts the gaps based on whether they are odd or even and then tries to maximize the number of triangles by choosing the smallest gaps first. However, this approach does not guarantee the maximum number of triangles.

2. **Handling of Remaining Vertices (`y`)**:
   - The program uses the remaining vertices (`y`) to try to fill the gaps, but the logic to do this is incorrect. It does not consider the optimal way to use the remaining vertices to form the maximum number of triangles.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the number of vertices (`n`), the number of chosen vertices (`x`), and the number of additional vertices (`y`) are at their extreme values.

### Example Case

Let's consider a simple example to illustrate the problem:

**Input:**
```
1
6 3 2
1 3 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Explanation:**
- We start with a hexagon (6 sides) and vertices 1, 3, and 5 are chosen.
- The gaps between the chosen vertices are 2 (between 1 and 3), 2 (between 3 and 5), and 2 (between 5 and 1).
- We can add 2 more vertices to maximize the number of triangles.
- One optimal way is to add vertices 2 and 4.
- The resulting triangles are (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 4), (2, 3, 4), and (3, 4, 5).
- Total triangles = 4.

**Program Output:**
- The program might output a different number of triangles because of the flawed logic.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly handle the logic for maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangles. It does not consider the optimal placement of additional vertices and the calculation of gaps is not correctly implemented.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
