Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific integer value based on the given number of vertices (`n`), the number of chosen vertices (`x`), a limit (`y`), and the list of chosen vertices. The value is derived from the gaps between the chosen vertices and the limit `y`.**
