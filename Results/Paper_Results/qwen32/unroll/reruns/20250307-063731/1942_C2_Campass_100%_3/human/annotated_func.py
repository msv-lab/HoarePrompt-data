#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), y is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific integer value based on the given number of vertices (`n`), the number of chosen vertices (`x`), a limit (`y`), and the list of chosen vertices. The value is derived from the gaps between the chosen vertices and the limit `y`.
