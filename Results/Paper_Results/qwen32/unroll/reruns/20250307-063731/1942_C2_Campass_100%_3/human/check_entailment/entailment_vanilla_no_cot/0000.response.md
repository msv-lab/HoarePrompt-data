Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Triangular Pieces**:
   - The program aims to maximize the number of triangular pieces by choosing additional vertices. However, the logic for calculating the number of triangles is flawed.
   - The program sorts the gaps between the chosen vertices and attempts to fill those gaps with additional vertices to form triangles. However, the formula used (`i // 2`) to calculate the number of triangles that can be formed in a gap of size `i` is incorrect. For a gap of size `i`, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed is `i - 2` (if the gap is large enough to form triangles).

2. **Handling of Additional Vertices**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the scenario where additional vertices are used to fill gaps between the initially chosen vertices. The logic for decrementing `y` (the number of additional vertices available) and updating `sx` (the sum of filled gaps) is incorrect.

3. **Final Calculation of Triangles**:
   - The final calculation of the number of triangles (`cons = x + sx - 2`) is incorrect. The number of triangles should be derived from the correct number of filled gaps and the initial number of chosen vertices.

To correctly solve this problem, a different approach is needed. One possible approach is to use a greedy strategy to fill the largest gaps first with the available additional vertices and then calculate the number of triangles that can be formed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = int(data[index])
        x = int(data[index + 1])
        y = int(data[index + 2])
        index += 3
        
        vertices = list(map(int, data[index:index + x]))
        index += x
        vertices.sort()
        vertices.append(vertices[0] + n)
        
        gaps = []
        for i in range(x):
            gaps.append(vertices[i + 1] - vertices[i] - 1)
        
        gaps.sort(reverse=True)
        triangles = 0
        
        for gap in gaps:
            if y == 0:
                break
            if gap < 2:
                continue
            fill = min(gap // 2, y)
            triangles += fill
            y -= fill
        
        results.append(triangles)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Uncomment the following line to test the function with input
# func()
```

This corrected version sorts the gaps in descending order and fills the largest gaps first with the available additional vertices, correctly calculating the number of triangles that can be formed.
