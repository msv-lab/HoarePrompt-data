The code snippet provided defines a lambda function `R` which reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer. This function is not executed; it is only defined. Therefore, the state of the variables `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of vertices does not change.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), y is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; the second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer.**
