To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the state of `tc` such that the condition `tc > 0` is satisfied. The variable `t` does not affect the loop condition and thus does not need to be adjusted.

Given the loop condition `while tc > 0:`, `tc` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State right before the while loop: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `tc` is an input integer.

Since `tc` needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, we adjust the state of `tc` accordingly.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `tc` must be greater than 0**
