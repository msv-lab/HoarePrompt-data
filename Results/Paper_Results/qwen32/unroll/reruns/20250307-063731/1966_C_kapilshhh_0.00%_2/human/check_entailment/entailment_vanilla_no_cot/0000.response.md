Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a logical error in the final print statement, where it always prints "Alice" regardless of the value of `dp`. The correct print statement should be:

```python
print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
```

This change ensures that the program correctly identifies the winner based on the value of `dp`.
