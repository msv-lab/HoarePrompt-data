Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program contains a logical error in the final print statement. Specifically, it always prints "Alice" regardless of the value of `dp`. The correct print statement should be:

```python
print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
```

This change ensures that the output correctly reflects the winner based on the value of `dp`. As it stands, the program will always output "Alice" even when `dp` is `False`, which is incorrect.

Here is a specific test case to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Alice
```

**Actual Output:**
```
Alice
```

However, for the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
2
1 7
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Bob
```

**Actual Output:**
```
Alice
```

This shows that the current implementation is incorrect because it always prints "Alice" regardless of the game state.
