Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided code and compare it with the problem requirements and the expected outputs.

### Issues in the Code:

1. **Incorrect Winner Decision:**
   - The line `print('Alice' if dp else 'Alice')` is incorrect. It always prints "Alice" regardless of the value of `dp`. It should print "Alice" if `dp` is `True` and "Bob" if `dp` is `False`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `dp`:**
   - The `dp` variable is intended to determine the winner based on the game state. However, the logic used to calculate `dp` seems incorrect and does not match the game rules.
   - The game is essentially a variant of Nim, where the key is to determine the Grundy number (or Nim-sum) of the piles. However, the provided code does not compute the Grundy number or any equivalent for this game variant.

3. **Sorting and Deduplication:**
   - The code sorts the unique pile sizes in descending order and appends a `0` to the list. This step might be intended to simplify the calculation of `dp`, but it does not align with the optimal strategy for determining the winner.

### Correct Approach:

To determine the winner in this game, the correct approach involves understanding the game's mechanics. This game is a variant of Nim where the moves are restricted to removing the same number of stones from each non-empty pile. The winning strategy can be derived from the XOR-sum (Grundy number) of the pile sizes, but with the constraint that the number of stones removed must be at most the size of the smallest pile.

However, a simpler observation can be made:
- If the number of piles with an odd number of stones is odd, Alice wins.
- If the number of piles with an odd number of stones is even, Bob wins.

This is because each move changes the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones, and the player who faces a situation with an even number of such piles will always be able to force the opponent into a losing position.

### Corrected Code:

Here's the corrected version of the code based on the above reasoning:

```python
def func():
    tc = int(input())
    while tc > 0:
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        odd_count = sum(1 for x in arr if x % 2 != 0)
        
        print('Alice' if odd_count % 2 != 0 else 'Bob')
        
        tc -= 1

func()
```

### Conclusion:

Given the issues in the provided code, the correctness of the original program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
