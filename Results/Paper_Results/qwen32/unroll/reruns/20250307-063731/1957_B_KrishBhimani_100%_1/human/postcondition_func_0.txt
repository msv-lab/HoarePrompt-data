The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it outputs a list of `n` integers. If `n` is 1, the output is simply `k`. Otherwise, the output list contains the largest power of 2 less than `k` minus 1 as the first element, followed by `k` minus this power of 2 minus 1 as the second element, and the rest of the elements are zeros.
