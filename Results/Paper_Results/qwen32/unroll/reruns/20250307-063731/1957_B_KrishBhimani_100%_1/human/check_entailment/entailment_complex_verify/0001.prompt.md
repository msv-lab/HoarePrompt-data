You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        if n == 1:
            print(k)
        else:
            arr = []
            k0 = k
            i = 0
            ans = []
            temp = 1
            while True:
                if temp * 2 < k:
                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:
                    break
            ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #State: For each test case, the output is a list of integers of length `n`. The first element is the largest power of 2 less than `k` minus 1, the second element is `k - (2^i - 1)`, and the rest of the elements are zeros.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it outputs a list of `n` integers. If `n` is 1, the output is simply `k`. Otherwise, the output list contains the largest power of 2 less than `k` minus 1 as the first element, followed by `k` minus this power of 2 minus 1 as the second element, and the rest of the elements are zeros.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Sum Constraint**: The sequence \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) must sum up to \(k\).
2. **Bitwise OR Constraint**: The number of 1s in the binary representation of \(a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n\) must be maximized.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to construct the sequence as follows:
1. **Single Element Case**: If \(n = 1\), the only possible sequence is \([k]\) because there's only one element to fill.
2. **Multiple Elements Case**:
   - The program tries to find the largest power of 2 less than \(k\), which is stored in `temp`.
   - It then appends \((1 << i) - 1\) to the sequence, where \(i\) is the highest power such that \(2^i \leq k\).
   - The remaining sum \(k - \text{sum(ans)}\) is appended as the next element.
   - The rest of the sequence is filled with zeros to ensure the length is \(n\).

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Maximizing 1s in Binary Representation**:
   - The program only considers one large number \((1 << i) - 1\) and the rest zeros, which does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR.
   - For example, for the input `2 5`, the program outputs `3 2`, but a better solution is `1 4` because `1 | 4 = 5` (binary `101`) has more 1s than `3 | 2 = 3` (binary `11`).

2. **General Strategy**:
   - A better strategy would be to distribute the sum \(k\) across the numbers in such a way that the bitwise OR has the maximum number of 1s. One effective way is to use the smallest powers of 2 that sum up to \(k\), as this tends to spread the 1s across more bits.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided program does not always produce a sequence that maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
