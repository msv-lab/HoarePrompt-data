In the provided code snippet, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the integer value of the input. The loop variable is `_`, which is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is intentionally unused. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of iterations specified by the input. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is the value of `t`.

Since the loop head only involves the variable `_` (which is unused) and the range determined by `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is set to a value that will allow the loop to execute the intended number of times.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**

This state already ensures that the loop will execute `t` times, so no further adjustments are needed for the loop head variables. The values of `n` and `k`, which are mentioned in the problem description, are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted at this point.
