To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand what the given code does for each test case. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, the code reads two integers, `n` and `k`.
2. **Edge Case Handling**: If `n` is 1, it simply prints `k`.
3. **Main Logic**:
   - Initializes an empty list `arr` (not used in the final output).
   - Keeps a copy of `k` in `k0` (also not used in the final output).
   - Initializes `i` to 0 and `ans` to an empty list.
   - Uses a `while` loop to find the largest power of 2 less than `k`. It multiplies `temp` by 2 until `temp * 2` is no longer less than `k`. The number of multiplications is stored in `i`.
   - Appends `(1 << i) - 1` to `ans`. This is equivalent to `2^i - 1`.
   - Appends `k - sum(ans)` to `ans`, which is `k - (2^i - 1)`.
   - Appends zeros to `ans` until its length is `n`.
   - Prints the elements of `ans`.

The output for each test case is a list of integers of length `n`. The first element is the largest power of 2 less than `k` minus 1, the second element is the remainder when `k` is reduced by this power of 2 minus 1, and the rest of the elements are zeros.

Given that the initial state specifies multiple test cases, the output state will be a series of these lists, one for each test case.

Output State: **For each test case, the output is a list of integers of length `n`. The first element is the largest power of 2 less than `k` minus 1, the second element is `k - (2^i - 1)`, and the rest of the elements are zeros.**
