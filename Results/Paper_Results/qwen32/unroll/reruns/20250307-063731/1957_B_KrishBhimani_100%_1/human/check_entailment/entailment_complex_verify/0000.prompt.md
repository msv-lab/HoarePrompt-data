You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        if n == 1:
            print(k)
        else:
            arr = []
            k0 = k
            i = 0
            ans = []
            temp = 1
            while True:
                if temp * 2 < k:
                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:
                    break
            ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)

    #State: For each test case, the output is a list of integers of length `n`. The first element is the largest power of 2 less than `k` minus 1, the second element is `k - (2^i - 1)`, and the rest of the elements are zeros.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it outputs a list of `n` integers. If `n` is 1, the output is simply `k`. Otherwise, the output list contains the largest power of 2 less than `k` minus 1 as the first element, followed by `k` minus this power of 2 minus 1 as the second element, and the rest of the elements are zeros.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not always produce a sequence that maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence elements. Let's analyze the code and identify a case where it fails.

The program attempts to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR by using the largest possible power of 2 that is less than `k` and then filling the rest with 0s. However, this approach does not always yield the optimal solution.

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
3 5
```

**Expected Output:**
A sequence such that the sum is 5 and the bitwise OR has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation. One possible correct output is:
```
1 2 2
```
Here, `1 | 2 | 2 = 3` which in binary is `11`, having 2 ones.

However, the provided program would output:
```
3 2 0
```
Here, `3 | 2 | 0 = 3` which in binary is `11`, having 2 ones, but it is not optimal. Another correct output could be `1 2 2` or `1 4 0`, but the program does not generate these.

Another test case to illustrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
4 10
```

**Expected Output:**
A sequence such that the sum is 10 and the bitwise OR has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation. One possible correct output is:
```
2 2 4 2
```
Here, `2 | 2 | 4 | 2 = 6` which in binary is `110`, having 2 ones.

However, the provided program would output:
```
7 3 0 0
```
Here, `7 | 3 | 0 | 0 = 7` which in binary is `111`, having 3 ones, but it is not optimal as it does not use the sequence in a way that maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR for the given sum.

Thus, the provided program does not always generate a sequence that maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence elements, making it incorrect.
