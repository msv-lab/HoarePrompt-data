### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to generate an array of integers such that the array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The algorithm seems to recursively construct such an array by leveraging the properties of binary numbers and increasing subsequences.

Let's break down the code to understand its correctness:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - The function takes two parameters: `number` (the number of increasing subsequences desired) and `sequence` (the output array being constructed).
    - If `number` is 0, it means no more subsequences are needed, so it returns 0.
    - Otherwise, it determines the largest `size` such that `2^(size + 1) - 1` is less than or equal to `number`. This is done to find the highest power of 2 that fits within `number`.
    - It then appends integers from 0 to `size - 1` to the `sequence`.
    - The function calls itself recursively with the argument `number - (1 << size) + 1` (which is equivalent to `number - 2^size + 1`), and the result of this recursive call is stored in `result`.
    - After the recursive call, it modifies the last `size` elements of the `sequence` by adding `result` to each of them.

2. **Main Program**:
    - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads the desired number of increasing subsequences `X`.
    - It initializes an empty list `result` and calls `func_1` with `X - 1` and `result`.
    - It then prints the length of `result` and the elements of `result`.

### Analysis:

- The algorithm is designed to generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences using a combination of binary numbers and recursive construction.
- The core idea is to use the properties of binary numbers to partition the problem into smaller subproblems.
- The recursive call `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)` ensures that the number of increasing subsequences is correctly partitioned and handled.
- The modification of the last `size` elements by adding `result` ensures that the constructed subsequences are distinct and meet the required count.

### Conclusion:

The provided program appears to be correctly implementing the logic to generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The recursive approach and the use of binary numbers seem to cover the required conditions.

However, there are a couple of concerns:
1. The program does not handle the case where `X` is 1, which is not mentioned in the problem constraints but should be handled correctly.
2. The program does not explicitly handle the case where `X` is greater than `2^200 - 1` (which is the maximum number of increasing subsequences for an array of length 200), although this is not explicitly required by the problem constraints.

Given the constraints and the provided logic, the program seems to be correct for the intended problem.
