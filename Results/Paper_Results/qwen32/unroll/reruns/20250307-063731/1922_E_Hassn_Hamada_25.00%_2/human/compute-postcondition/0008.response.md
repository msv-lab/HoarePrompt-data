To determine the output state, let's first understand the given code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state specifies that `size` is the largest integer such that \(2^{\text{size}} \leq \text{number} + 1\). This means `size` is calculated based on the value of `number`.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(size):
    sequence.append(i)
```
This loop runs `size` times, and in each iteration, it appends the loop variable `i` to the list `sequence`.

Let's break down what happens in the loop:
- The loop variable `i` takes on values from 0 up to `size - 1`.
- For each iteration, the value of `i` is appended to the list `sequence`.

Therefore, after the loop completes, `sequence` will contain all integers from 0 to `size - 1`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `sequence`. The other variables (`size` and `number`) remain unchanged.

**Output State: sequence contains integers from 0 to size - 1.**
