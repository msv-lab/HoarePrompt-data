### Reasoning:

To evaluate the correctness of the given program, we need to verify whether it constructs an array with exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences for any valid \( X \) within the range \( 2 \leq X \leq 10^{18} \).

#### Program Analysis

1. **Base Case**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if `number` is 0. If so, it returns 0, indicating no elements are added to the sequence. This is correct since an empty sequence has exactly 1 increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence itself), but since \( X \geq 2 \), this case is not directly relevant for our problem.

2. **Determine Size**:
   - The function calculates the largest `size` such that \( (1 << (size + 1)) - 1 \leq \text{number} \). This is equivalent to finding the largest \( k \) such that \( 2^{k+1} - 1 \leq \text{number} \). This step is crucial for decomposing the problem into smaller subproblems.

3. **Add Elements**:
   - It appends `size` elements (0, 1, 2, ..., `size-1`) to the sequence. This step initializes the sequence with a base set of increasing elements.

4. **Recursive Call**:
   - It recursively calls `func_1` with the adjusted number \(\text{number} - (1 << \text{size}) + 1\). This recursive call is central to the algorithm, as it breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems.

5. **Adjust Elements**:
   - After the recursive call, it adjusts the last `size` elements of the sequence by adding the result of the recursive call to each of them. This adjustment ensures that the sequence maintains the property of having exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.

#### Mathematical Insight

The key insight is that the number of increasing subsequences of an array can be manipulated by carefully choosing the elements. The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly \( X \).

The calculation \( (1 << (size + 1)) - 1 \) is equivalent to \( 2^{k+1} - 1 \). This is related to the number of increasing subsequences that can be formed by a binary representation of the number. The function effectively uses a binary-like approach to decompose the number \( X \) into a sequence of elements that correspond to the desired number of increasing subsequences.

#### Verification

The given example output for the test cases matches the expected number of increasing subsequences, which suggests that the function is working correctly. However, we need to ensure that the function can handle the full range of \( X \) values, from 2 to \( 10^{18} \).

- For \( X = 2 \), the sequence `[0]` has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: `[]` and `[0]`.
- For \( X = 5 \), the sequence `[0, 1, 0]` has exactly 5 increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[0, 1]`, and `[0, 0]`.
- For \( X = 13 \), the sequence `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]` has exactly 13 increasing subsequences.
- For \( X = 37 \), the sequence `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]` has exactly 37 increasing subsequences.

The annotated code and the function's logic appear to be consistent with the problem's requirements. The function correctly decomposes the problem into smaller subproblems and adjusts the sequence to ensure the desired number of increasing subsequences.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and the matching example output, the program appears to be correct. The function `func_1` effectively constructs a sequence that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences for any valid \( X \).

Final: **True**
