Output State: **`result` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`, `sequence` contains integers from 0 to size - 1.**

Explanation: The variable `result` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_1` when called with the arguments `number - (1 << size) + 1` and `sequence`. The `sequence` remains unchanged and still contains integers from 0 to size - 1.
