To determine the output state after the loop finishes executing, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the `size` variable.

The loop condition is `while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number:`. Here, `1 << size + 1` is a bit shift operation that is equivalent to `2^(size + 1)`. The loop continues as long as `2^(size + 1) - 1` is less than or equal to `number`.

Let's break down the loop:

1. **Initial State**: `size` is 1.
2. **Loop Condition**: `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number` translates to `2^(size + 1) - 1 <= number`.
3. **Loop Body**: `size += 1` increments the `size` variable by 1.

The loop will keep running until `2^(size + 1) - 1` exceeds `number`.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's assume `number` is 10:
- **Iteration 1**: `size = 1`, `2^(1+1) - 1 = 3` which is `<= 10`, so `size` becomes `2`.
- **Iteration 2**: `size = 2`, `2^(2+1) - 1 = 7` which is `<= 10`, so `size` becomes `3`.
- **Iteration 3**: `size = 3`, `2^(3+1) - 1 = 15` which is `> 10`, so the loop terminates.

In this example, the loop terminates when `size` is 3.

### General Case

The loop terminates when `2^(size + 1) - 1` exceeds `number`. Therefore, the final value of `size` will be the smallest integer such that `2^(size + 1) - 1 > number`.

In other words, `size` is the largest integer such that `2^size <= number + 1`.

### Output State

The `size` variable will be incremented until the condition `2^(size + 1) - 1 > number` is met. The other variables (`number` and `sequence`) remain unchanged as per the problem statement.

Output State: **size is the largest integer such that 2^size <= number + 1.**

In natural language: The output state is that the `size` variable will be the largest integer such that `2` raised to the power of `size` is less than or equal to `number + 1`. The `number` and `sequence` variables remain unchanged.
