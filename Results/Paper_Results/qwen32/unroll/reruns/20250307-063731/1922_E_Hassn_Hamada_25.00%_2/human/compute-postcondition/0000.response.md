To solve this task, we need to understand the function's purpose and how it modifies the `sequence` list to ensure it has exactly `number` increasing subsequences. However, the provided code snippet is incomplete and only includes a function definition without the actual implementation. 

Given the function's description, we can infer that the function will generate a sequence such that there are exactly `number` increasing subsequences. The specific method to achieve this is not provided, but we can assume that the function will modify the `sequence` list accordingly.

Since the code snippet is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values or modifications to the `sequence` list. However, we can infer the output state based on the function's purpose.

Output State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and `sequence` is a list of integers that has been modified to contain exactly `number` increasing subsequences. The function returns the size of the generated sequence.**

In simpler terms, the `sequence` list has been changed to have the exact number of increasing subsequences specified by `number`, and the function returns the length of this new sequence.
