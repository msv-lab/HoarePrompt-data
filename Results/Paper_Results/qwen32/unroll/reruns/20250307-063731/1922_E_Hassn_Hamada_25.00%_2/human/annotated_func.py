#State of the program right berfore the function call: number is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and sequence is a list of integers where the length of the sequence is at most 200 and all elements are in the range [-10^9, 10^9]. However, in the context of the problem, sequence is not an input but rather the output array that needs to be constructed to have exactly 'number' increasing subsequences.

    #The program returns the sum of `size` and `result`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` constructs a sequence such that it contains exactly `number` increasing subsequences. It accepts an integer `number` (where 2 <= number <= 10^18) and a list `sequence` (which is modified in place to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences). The function returns the size of the generated sequence. If `number` is 0, it returns 0. Otherwise, it modifies the `sequence` list to ensure it contains the specified number of increasing subsequences and returns the total size of the sequence.
