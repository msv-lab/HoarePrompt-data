Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number`, which is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and `sequence`, which is a list of integers where the length of the sequence is at most 200 and all elements are in the range [-10^9, 10^9]. The function is designed to construct the `sequence` such that it contains exactly `number` increasing subsequences. The function returns 0 in Case_1. In Case_2, it returns the sum of `size` and `result`.**
