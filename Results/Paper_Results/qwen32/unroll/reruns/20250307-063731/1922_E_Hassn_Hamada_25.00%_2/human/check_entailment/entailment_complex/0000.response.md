Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by generating a sequence that contains exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The core logic is implemented in the function `func_1`, which recursively constructs the sequence based on the binary representation of the number of subsequences.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Base Case**: If `number` is 0, the function returns 0, indicating that no elements are needed to achieve 0 subsequences.

2. **Determine Size**: The function calculates the largest `size` such that \(2^{(\text{size} + 1)} - 1 \leq \text{number}\). This essentially determines how many bits are needed to represent `number` in binary, which helps in constructing the sequence.

3. **Append Elements**: The function appends integers from 0 to `size - 1` to the sequence. This ensures that the sequence grows in a way that allows for the construction of increasing subsequences.

4. **Recursive Call**: The function makes a recursive call with the adjusted `number` (\(\text{number} - 2^\text{size} + 1\)). This recursive call helps in breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems.

5. **Adjust Elements**: After the recursive call, the function adjusts the elements in the sequence by incrementing them based on the result of the recursive call. This adjustment is crucial for ensuring that the sequence can generate the exact number of increasing subsequences required.

6. **Return Size**: Finally, the function returns the size of the generated sequence, which is the sum of `size` and the result of the recursive call.

The code appears to correctly implement the logic required to generate a sequence with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The use of binary representation and recursive adjustment ensures that the sequence is constructed in a way that meets the problem's requirements.

However, there are a few points to consider:
- The code does not handle the case where `number` is 1 explicitly, but since the problem specifies `2 <= X <= 10^18`, this is not an issue.
- The code does not include any error handling or checks for invalid inputs, but the problem guarantees valid inputs, so this is not necessary.

Given the problem constraints and the provided code, the program seems to correctly generate the required sequence for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
