To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's break down the given code step by step.

### Initial State
- `result` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`.
- `sequence` contains integers from 0 to `size - 1`.

### Loop Code
```python
for i in range(size):
    assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1
    sequence[-result - i - 1] += result
```

### Analysis

1. **Loop Iteration:**
   - The loop runs `size` times, with `i` ranging from 0 to `size - 1`.

2. **Index Calculation:**
   - The index used to access the `sequence` list is `-result - i - 1`.
   - The assertion ensures that this index is within the valid range for the list `sequence`, specifically between `-len(sequence)` and `-1`.

3. **Modification of `sequence`:**
   - During each iteration, the element at the calculated index is incremented by `result`.

### Step-by-Step Execution

Let's assume `size = 5` and `sequence = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` for illustration.

- **Iteration 1 (i = 0):**
  - Index: `-result - 0 - 1 = -result - 1`
  - `sequence[-result - 1] += result`
  
- **Iteration 2 (i = 1):**
  - Index: `-result - 1 - 1 = -result - 2`
  - `sequence[-result - 2] += result`
  
- **Iteration 3 (i = 2):**
  - Index: `-result - 2 - 1 = -result - 3`
  - `sequence[-result - 3] += result`
  
- **Iteration 4 (i = 3):**
  - Index: `-result - 3 - 1 = -result - 4`
  - `sequence[-result - 4] += result`
  
- **Iteration 5 (i = 4):**
  - Index: `-result - 4 - 1 = -result - 5`
  - `sequence[-result - 5] += result`

### Final State
- The value of `result` remains unchanged.
- The elements of `sequence` at indices `-result - 1`, `-result - 2`, ..., `-result - size` are each incremented by `result`.

### Output State
- The `result` variable retains its initial value.
- The `sequence` list has its elements at specific negative indices incremented by `result`.

### Conclusion
Given the loop's behavior, the final state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`result` remains unchanged, and elements of `sequence` at indices `-result - 1` to `-result - size` are each incremented by `result`.**
