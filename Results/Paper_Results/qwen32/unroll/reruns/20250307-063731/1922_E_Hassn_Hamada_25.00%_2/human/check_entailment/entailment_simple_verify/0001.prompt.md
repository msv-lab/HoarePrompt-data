You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether it correctly generates an array that has exactly X increasing subsequences for each test case. Let's break down the program and the logic behind it.

### Program Analysis

The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads an integer \( X \) and then calls `func_1(n - 1, result)` to generate a sequence of numbers that corresponds to an array with exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. The generated sequence is then printed.

#### Function `func_1`

The function `func_1` is responsible for generating the sequence. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Base Case**: If `number` is 0, it returns 0, indicating that no elements are added to the sequence.
2. **Determine Size**: It calculates the largest `size` such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 \leq \text{number}\). This is equivalent to finding the largest \( k \) such that \( 2^{k+1} - 1 \leq \text{number} \).
3. **Add Elements**: It appends `size` elements (0, 1, 2, ..., `size-1`) to the sequence.
4. **Recursive Call**: It recursively calls `func_1` with the adjusted number \(\text{number} - (1 << \text{size}) + 1\).
5. **Adjust Elements**: After the recursive call, it adjusts the last `size` elements of the sequence by adding the result of the recursive call to each of them.

### Mathematical Insight

The key insight here is that the number of increasing subsequences of an array can be manipulated by carefully choosing the elements. The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly \( X \).

#### Explanation of the Calculation

The calculation \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1\) is equivalent to \( 2^{k+1} - 1 \). This is related to the number of increasing subsequences that can be formed by a binary representation of the number. The function effectively uses a binary-like approach to decompose the number \( X \) into a sequence of elements that correspond to the desired number of increasing subsequences.

### Verification

To verify the correctness, we can check if the function generates sequences that indeed produce the required number of increasing subsequences. The given example output for the test cases matches the expected number of increasing subsequences, which suggests that the function is working correctly.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and the matching example output, the program appears to be correct.
