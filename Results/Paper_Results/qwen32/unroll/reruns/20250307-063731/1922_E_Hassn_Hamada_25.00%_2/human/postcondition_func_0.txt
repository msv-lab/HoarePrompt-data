The function `func_1` constructs a sequence such that it contains exactly `number` increasing subsequences. It accepts an integer `number` (where 2 <= number <= 10^18) and a list `sequence` (which is modified in place to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences). The function returns the size of the generated sequence. If `number` is 0, it returns 0. Otherwise, it modifies the `sequence` list to ensure it contains the specified number of increasing subsequences and returns the total size of the sequence.
