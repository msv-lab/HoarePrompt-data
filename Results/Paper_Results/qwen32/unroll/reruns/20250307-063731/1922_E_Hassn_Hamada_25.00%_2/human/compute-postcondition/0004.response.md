Output State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers that has been modified to contain exactly `number` increasing subsequences, `size` is 1, and the function returns the size of the generated sequence.**

In simple terms, the variable `size` is now set to 1. The other variables, `number` and `sequence`, remain unchanged from their initial state. The function returns the value of `size`, which is 1.
