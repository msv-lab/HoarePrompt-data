Let's analyze the given `while` loop condition:

```
while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the expression `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is less than or equal to `number`. Here, `1 << size + 1` is a bitwise left shift operation, which is equivalent to `2^(size + 1)`. Therefore, the condition can be rewritten as:

```
while 2^(size + 1) - 1 <= number:
```

Given the state right before the loop:
- `number` is an integer such that `2 <= number <= 10^18`
- `sequence` is a list of integers that has been modified to contain exactly `number` increasing subsequences
- `size` is 1

We need to ensure that the condition `2^(size + 1) - 1 <= number` holds true for the first iteration of the loop.

Let's substitute `size` with 1 in the condition:
```
2^(1 + 1) - 1 <= number
2^2 - 1 <= number
4 - 1 <= number
3 <= number
```

Since `number` is already given to be in the range `2 <= number <= 10^18`, the condition `3 <= number` will be satisfied as long as `number` is at least 3. However, if `number` is 2, the condition will not be satisfied, and the loop will not execute.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust `number` to be at least 3. No other variables (`sequence` or `size`) need to be adjusted because the condition only depends on `number` and `size`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`number` must be at least 3, `sequence` is a list of integers that has been modified to contain exactly `number` increasing subsequences, `size` is 1**
