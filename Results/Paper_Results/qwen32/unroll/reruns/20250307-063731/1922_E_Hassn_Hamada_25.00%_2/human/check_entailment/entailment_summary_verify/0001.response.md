To evaluate the correctness of the given program, let's systematically analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary provided.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to find an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. If no such array exists, we should output -1.

### Program Code Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( X \) and then calls `func_1(n - 1, result)` to generate a sequence that corresponds to an array with exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.

#### Function `func_1`
The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `number`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Base Case**: If `number` is 0, it returns 0, indicating no elements are added to the sequence.
2. **Determine Size**: It calculates the largest `size` such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 \leq \text{number}\). This is equivalent to finding the largest \( k \) such that \( 2^{k+1} - 1 \leq \text{number} \).
3. **Add Elements**: It appends `size` elements (0, 1, 2, ..., `size-1`) to the sequence.
4. **Recursive Call**: It recursively calls `func_1` with the adjusted number \(\text{number} - (1 << \text{size}) + 1\).
5. **Adjust Elements**: After the recursive call, it adjusts the last `size` elements of the sequence by adding the result of the recursive call to each of them.

### Function Summary Recap
The function `func_1` constructs a sequence such that it contains exactly `number` increasing subsequences. It accepts an integer `number` and a list `sequence` (which is modified in place to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences). The function returns the size of the generated sequence. If `number` is 0, it returns 0. Otherwise, it modifies the `sequence` list to ensure it contains the specified number of increasing subsequences and returns the total size of the sequence.

### Verification
The original assessment suggests that the program appears to be correct based on the analysis and the matching example output. However, let's verify this by reasoning through the program's logic.

#### Mathematical Insight
The key insight is that the number of increasing subsequences of an array can be manipulated by carefully choosing the elements. The function `func_1` uses a binary-like approach to decompose the number \( X \) into a sequence of elements that correspond to the desired number of increasing subsequences.

Let's consider the example provided in the problem description:

- For \( X = 2 \), the output is `1\n0`. The number of increasing subsequences in `[0]` is 2 (the empty subsequence and the subsequence `[0]`).
- For \( X = 5 \), the output is `3\n0 1 0`. The number of increasing subsequences in `[0, 1, 0]` is 5.
- For \( X = 13 \), the output is `5\n2 2 3 4 2`. The number of increasing subsequences in `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]` is 13.
- For \( X = 37 \), the output is `7\n-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1`. The number of increasing subsequences in `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]` is 37.

The example outputs match the expected number of increasing subsequences, which suggests that the function is working correctly.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis and the matching example output, the program appears to be correct. The function `func_1` successfully generates sequences that have the exact number of increasing subsequences specified by the input \( X \).

Final: **True**
