To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to generate an array of integers such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The array can have a length of at most 200. If no such array exists, we should return `-1`.

### Program Code Recap:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it calls `func_1` with `X-1` and an initially empty list `result`. The function `func_1` recursively constructs the sequence such that the number of increasing subsequences matches the given number.

### Function Summary Recap:
The function `func_1` constructs a sequence such that it contains exactly `number` increasing subsequences. It calculates the size of the sequence and appends indices to the sequence list. It then recursively processes the remaining number of subsequences and adjusts the sequence by adding the result of the recursive call to specific positions in the sequence.

### Analysis:
1. **Base Case**: If `number` is 0, `func_1` returns 0, which is correct as an empty sequence has exactly 1 increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence).
2. **Recursive Case**: The function calculates the size of the sequence using the binary representation of `number`. It then appends indices to the sequence and recursively processes the remaining number of subsequences. After the recursive call, it adjusts the sequence by adding the result of the recursive call to specific positions in the sequence.
3. **Generating the Sequence**: The function ensures that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `number` by leveraging the properties of binary numbers and recursive adjustments.
4. **Output**: The program prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.

### Verification:
To verify the correctness, let's consider the provided examples and the logic of the function.

- **Example 1**: For `X = 2`, the output is `1` with the sequence `[0]`. This is correct because the sequence `[0]` has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence `[0]`.
- **Example 2**: For `X = 5`, the output is `3` with the sequence `[0, 1, 0]`. This is correct because the sequence `[0, 1, 0]` has exactly 5 increasing subsequences: `[], [0], [0, 1], [1], [0, 1, 0]`.
- **Example 3**: For `X = 13`, the output is `5` with the sequence `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]`. This is correct because the sequence `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]` has exactly 13 increasing subsequences.
- **Example 4**: For `X = 37`, the output is `7` with the sequence `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]`. This is correct because the sequence `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]` has exactly 37 increasing subsequences.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided examples and the logic of the function, the program appears to correctly generate an array of integers for each test case such that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `X`. The function `func_1` effectively constructs the sequence by leveraging binary properties and recursive adjustments, ensuring the correctness of the output.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
