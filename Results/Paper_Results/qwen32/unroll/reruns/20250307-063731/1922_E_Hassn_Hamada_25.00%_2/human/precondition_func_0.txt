number is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and sequence is a list of integers where the length of the sequence is at most 200 and all elements are in the range [-10^9, 10^9]. However, in the context of the problem, sequence is not an input but rather the output array that needs to be constructed to have exactly 'number' increasing subsequences.
