To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. In the provided `for` loop, the only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the range is defined by `size`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `size` is such that the loop can execute at least once.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `size` is greater than 0. If `size` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.
2. **Initialization of `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` is not explicitly initialized in the provided state. The loop will automatically initialize `i` to 0 when it starts.
3. **State of `result` and `sequence`**: The state of `result` and `sequence` does not affect whether the loop executes. However, they are part of the provided state, so we should include them in the final state statement.

Given this, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `size` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The initial value of `i` does not need to be specified as the loop will handle that.

Final Answer:
State: **`result` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`, `sequence` contains integers from 0 to size - 1, `size` must be greater than 0**
