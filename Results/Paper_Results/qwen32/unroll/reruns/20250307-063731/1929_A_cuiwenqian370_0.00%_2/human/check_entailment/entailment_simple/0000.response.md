### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array optimally. The provided program attempts to achieve this by sorting the array and then rearranging it in an alternating pattern of the largest and smallest remaining elements.

Let's break down the program's logic:

1. **Sorting and Rearranging:**
   - The array is sorted in ascending order.
   - The program then rearranges the array into a new array (`new_arr`) by alternately taking the largest and smallest remaining elements. This is done using two pointers, `left` and `right`, which start at the beginning and end of the sorted array, respectively.
   - The rearrangement continues until all elements are placed in `new_arr`.

2. **Calculating Beauty:**
   - The beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

### Analysis:

The core idea of the program is to maximize the differences between consecutive elements. By alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements, the program tries to maximize these differences.

Let's consider the examples provided:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `3, [2, 1, 3]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - Rearranged: `[3, 1, 2]` (or `[3, 2, 1]` which both yield the same result)
  - Beauty: `(3-1) + (2-1) = 2 + 1 = 3` (but the correct rearrangement is `[1, 3, 2]` yielding `(3-1) + (2-3) = 2`)

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `3, [69, 69, 69]`
  - Sorted: `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Rearranged: `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Beauty: `(69-69) + (69-69) = 0`

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `5, [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`
  - Sorted: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
  - Rearranged: `[100, 43, 90, 54, 80]`
  - Beauty: `(100-43) + (90-43) + (80-54) = 57 + 47 + 26 = 130` (but the correct rearrangement is `[43, 100, 54, 90, 80]` yielding `57`)

- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `4, [3, 4, 3, 3]`
  - Sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
  - Rearranged: `[4, 3, 3, 3]`
  - Beauty: `(4-3) + (3-3) + (3-3) = 1`

- **Example 5:**
  - Input: `2, [2, 1]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 2]`
  - Rearranged: `[2, 1]`
  - Beauty: `(2-1) = 1`

The program's rearrangement strategy does not always yield the maximum beauty. For example, in the first test case, the program produces a beauty of 3, but the optimal rearrangement `[1, 3, 2]` yields a beauty of 2.

### Conclusion:

The program does not always produce the correct maximum beauty for the array. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

**Correctness: False**
