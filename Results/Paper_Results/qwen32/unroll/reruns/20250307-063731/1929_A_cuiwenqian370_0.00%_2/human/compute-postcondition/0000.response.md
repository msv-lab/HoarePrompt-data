The code sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the precondition that each integer `a_i` in `arr` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` is still valid. The only change is that the elements of `arr` are now in non-decreasing order.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.**
