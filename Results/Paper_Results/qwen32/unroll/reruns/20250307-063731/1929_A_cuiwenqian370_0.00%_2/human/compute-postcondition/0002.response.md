Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `new_arr` is an empty list; `left` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `left` is initialized to 0. All other variables (`n`, `arr`, and `new_arr`) remain unchanged.
