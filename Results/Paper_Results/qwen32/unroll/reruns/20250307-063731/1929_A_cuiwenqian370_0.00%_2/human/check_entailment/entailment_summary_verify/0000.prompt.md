You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, arr)
    results.append(result)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        else:
            new_arr.append(arr[right])
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
    return max_beauty



- Function Summary: 
The function takes an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers, rearranges the list by pairing the largest and smallest elements consecutively, and returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements of this rearranged list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Sasha wants to maximize the beauty of an array `a`, where the beauty is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
- The array can be rearranged in any way to achieve this.
- The program needs to handle multiple test cases, each with an array of integers.

### Program Analysis:

The program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements.
3. It calls the function `func_1` with the array and its length.
4. Inside `func_1`, the array is sorted.
5. The sorted array is rearranged by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements.
6. The beauty of the rearranged array is calculated by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
7. The results are stored and printed after all test cases are processed.

### Correctness Check:
- The approach of sorting the array and then rearranging it by alternating between the largest and smallest elements is a valid strategy to maximize the beauty of the array.
- The beauty calculation by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements is correct.
- The program handles multiple test cases correctly by reading the input for each test case and processing them independently.

### Testing with Examples:
Let's test the program with the provided examples to ensure it works as expected.

#### Example 1:
Input:
```
5
3
2 1 3
3
69 69 69
5
100 54 80 43 90
4
3 4 3 3
2
2 1
```

Output:
```
2
0
57
1
1
```

The program produces the correct output for all the provided examples. 

### Conclusion:
Given that the program correctly handles the provided examples and the logic used to maximize the beauty of the array seems sound, we can conclude that the program is correct for every potential case.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program sorts the array and rearranges it by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements, which is an effective strategy to maximize the beauty of the array. The beauty calculation and handling of multiple test cases are also correct.
