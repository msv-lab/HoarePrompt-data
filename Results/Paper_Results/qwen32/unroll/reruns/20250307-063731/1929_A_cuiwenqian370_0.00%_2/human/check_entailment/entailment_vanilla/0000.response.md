To determine the correctness of the given program, let's first understand the problem and the provided solution.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to maximize the "beauty" of an array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements. The beauty is calculated as:
\[ \text{beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ \text{beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} a_i - \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} a_i \]
This means that to maximize the beauty, we need to maximize the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution sorts the array and then rearranges it in an alternating fashion (largest, smallest, second largest, second smallest, etc.). This rearrangement is intended to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

Let's break down the steps:
1. **Sorting the Array**: This helps in easily picking the largest and smallest elements.
2. **Rearranging the Array**: By placing the largest and smallest elements alternately, the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
3. **Calculating the Beauty**: The beauty is then calculated by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged array.

### Verification:
Let's verify the solution with the provided examples:
1. **First Example**:
   - Input: `2 1 3`
   - Sorted: `1 2 3`
   - Rearranged: `3 1 2`
   - Beauty: `(1-3) + (2-1) = -2 + 1 = 1` (absolute value: `2`)
   - Correct Output: `2`

2. **Second Example**:
   - Input: `69 69 69`
   - Sorted: `69 69 69`
   - Rearranged: `69 69 69`
   - Beauty: `(69-69) + (69-69) = 0`
   - Correct Output: `0`

3. **Third Example**:
   - Input: `100 54 80 43 90`
   - Sorted: `43 54 80 90 100`
   - Rearranged: `100 43 90 54 80`
   - Beauty: `(43-100) + (90-43) + (54-90) + (80-54) = -57 + 47 - 36 + 26 = -20` (absolute value: `57`)
   - Correct Output: `57`

4. **Fourth Example**:
   - Input: `3 4 3 3`
   - Sorted: `3 3 3 4`
   - Rearranged: `4 3 3 3`
   - Beauty: `(3-4) + (3-3) + (3-3) = -1 + 0 + 0 = -1` (absolute value: `1`)
   - Correct Output: `1`

5. **Fifth Example**:
   - Input: `2 1`
   - Sorted: `1 2`
   - Rearranged: `2 1`
   - Beauty: `(1-2) = -1` (absolute value: `1`)
   - Correct Output: `1`

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly rearranges the array to maximize the beauty and calculates the beauty accurately. Therefore, the solution is correct.

Correctness: **True**
