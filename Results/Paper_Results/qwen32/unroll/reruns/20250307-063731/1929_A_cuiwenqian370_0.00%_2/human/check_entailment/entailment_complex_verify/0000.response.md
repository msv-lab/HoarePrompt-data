### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the provided program and its annotations to determine if it correctly solves the problem of maximizing the beauty of the array.

#### Problem Recap:
- The beauty of an array \( a \) is given by the sum of \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for all integers \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).
- We can rearrange the elements of the array to maximize this beauty.

#### Program Breakdown:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \) and the array elements \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Sorting:** The array is sorted in ascending order.
   - **Rearrangement:** The sorted array is rearranged by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements.
     - This is done using two pointers, `left` and `right`, which start at the beginning and end of the sorted array, respectively.
     - Elements are added to `new_arr` from `arr[right]` and `arr[left]` alternately until all elements are added.
     - If `left` equals `right`, the middle element is added once.
   - **Beauty Calculation:** The beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

3. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations confirm the state of the program at key points:
     - After sorting, `arr` is in ascending order.
     - `new_arr` is constructed by alternating between the largest and smallest elements.
     - `max_beauty` is correctly computed as the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

#### Analysis and Verification:
- **Sorting and Rearrangement:**
  - Sorting the array is a good first step to identify the smallest and largest elements.
  - The rearrangement strategy of alternating between the largest and smallest elements is a well-known approach to maximize the sum of differences.
  - This strategy ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, contributing to the highest possible beauty.

- **Beauty Calculation:**
  - The beauty is correctly calculated as the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged array.

- **Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by processing each test case independently and storing the results.

- **Example Validation:**
  - The program produces the correct output for the provided examples, which further supports its correctness.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and verification, the program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the beauty of the array. The annotations accurately reflect the program's state and behavior, and the example validation confirms the program's correctness.

**Final: True**
