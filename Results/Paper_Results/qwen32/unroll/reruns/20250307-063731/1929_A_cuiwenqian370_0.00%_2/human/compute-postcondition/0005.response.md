To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's analyze the provided code and the initial state.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100.
- `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.
- `new_arr` is an empty list.
- `left` is 0.
- `right` is `n - 1`.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop runs as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right`. In each iteration:
- If `left` equals `right`, it means only one element is left in the middle of the list, and this element is appended to `new_arr`.
- Otherwise, the element at the `right` index and the element at the `left` index are appended to `new_arr` in that order.
- After each iteration, `left` is incremented by 1 and `right` is decremented by 1.

### Output State:
The loop essentially rearranges the elements of `arr` by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements. This process continues until all elements have been added to `new_arr`.

- **`new_arr`**: The elements of `arr` will be rearranged such that the largest and smallest elements are paired together, starting from the ends of the sorted list towards the center. If `n` is odd, the middle element will be the last element added to `new_arr`.
- **`left`**: After the loop, `left` will be equal to `right + 1`, indicating that all elements have been processed.
- **`right`**: After the loop, `right` will be equal to `left - 1`, indicating that all elements have been processed.
- **`arr`**: The original list `arr` remains unchanged.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged.

### Example:
For `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` (where `n = 5`):
- Iteration 1: `new_arr = [5, 1]`, `left = 1`, `right = 3`
- Iteration 2: `new_arr = [5, 1, 4, 2]`, `left = 2`, `right = 2`
- Iteration 3: `new_arr = [5, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, `left = 3`, `right = 1` (loop terminates since `left > right`)

### Output State:
Output State: **`new_arr` is a rearranged list of `arr` with elements paired from largest to smallest, `left` is `n`, `right` is `n - 1`, `arr` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms, `new_arr` will have the largest and smallest elements of `arr` paired together, starting from the ends towards the center. If `arr` has an odd number of elements, the middle element will be the last in `new_arr`.
