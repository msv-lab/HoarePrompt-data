Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `new_arr` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The variable `new_arr` is initialized as an empty list. The values of `n` and `arr` remain unchanged.
