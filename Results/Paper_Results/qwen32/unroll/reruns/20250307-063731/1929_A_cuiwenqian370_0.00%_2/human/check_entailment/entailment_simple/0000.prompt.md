Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

for _ in range(t):

    results.append(result)
for result in results:
    print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and arr is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.

    arr.sort()

        left += 1
        
        right -= 1
        
    #State: `new_arr` is a rearranged list of `arr` with elements paired from largest to smallest, `left` is `n`, `right` is `n - 1`, `arr` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged.
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
        
    #State: `new_arr` is a rearranged list of `arr` with elements paired from largest to smallest, `left` is `n`, `right` is `n - 1`, `arr` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `max_beauty` is the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements of `new_arr`.
    return max_beauty
    #The program returns `max_beauty`, which is the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements of `new_arr`.
