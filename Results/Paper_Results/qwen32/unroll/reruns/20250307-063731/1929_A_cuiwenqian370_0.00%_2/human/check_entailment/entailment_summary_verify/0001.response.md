Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to maximize the "beauty" of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements:
\[ \text{beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution sorts the array and then rearranges it in an alternating fashion (largest, smallest, second largest, second smallest, etc.), aiming to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

### Verification:
Let's verify the solution with the provided examples:

1. **First Example**:
   - Input: `2 1 3`
   - Sorted: `1 2 3`
   - Rearranged: `3 1 2`
   - Beauty: \( |1-3| + |2-1| = 2 + 1 = 3 \) (incorrect, should be 2)
   - Correct Output: `2`

2. **Second Example**:
   - Input: `69 69 69`
   - Sorted: `69 69 69`
   - Rearranged: `69 69 69`
   - Beauty: \( |69-69| + |69-69| = 0 + 0 = 0 \)
   - Correct Output: `0`

3. **Third Example**:
   - Input: `100 54 80 43 90`
   - Sorted: `43 54 80 90 100`
   - Rearranged: `100 43 90 54 80`
   - Beauty: \( |43-100| + |90-43| + |54-90| + |80-54| = 57 + 47 + 36 + 26 = 166 \) (incorrect, should be 57)
   - Correct Output: `57`

4. **Fourth Example**:
   - Input: `3 4 3 3`
   - Sorted: `3 3 3 4`
   - Rearranged: `4 3 3 3`
   - Beauty: \( |3-4| + |3-3| + |3-3| = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 \)
   - Correct Output: `1`

5. **Fifth Example**:
   - Input: `2 1`
   - Sorted: `1 2`
   - Rearranged: `2 1`
   - Beauty: \( |1-2| = 1 \)
   - Correct Output: `1`

### Detailed Analysis:
The rearrangement strategy in the code is to place the largest and smallest elements alternately. However, the calculation of beauty in the code uses the absolute value of differences, which is correct. But the rearrangement strategy is not optimal for maximizing the beauty.

For maximizing the beauty, the optimal strategy is to place the smallest and largest elements at the ends and then alternate between the next smallest and next largest in between. This ensures the maximum possible differences between consecutive elements.

### Correct Rearrangement Strategy:
For example, in the first test case:
- Input: `2 1 3`
- Sorted: `1 2 3`
- Optimal Rearranged: `1 3 2` or `3 1 2` (both give the same beauty)
- Beauty: \( |3-1| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 = 3 \) (incorrect, should be 2)

The optimal rearrangement should be:
- Rearranged: `1 3` or `3 1`
- Beauty: \( |3-1| = 2 \)

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not always produce the correct maximum beauty. The rearrangement strategy needs to be adjusted to ensure the maximum possible differences between consecutive elements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
