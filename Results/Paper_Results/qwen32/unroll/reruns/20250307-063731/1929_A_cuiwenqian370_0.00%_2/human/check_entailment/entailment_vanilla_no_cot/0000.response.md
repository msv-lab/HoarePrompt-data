To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the logic and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements.
2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted.
3. **Rearrangement**: The sorted array is rearranged in a specific pattern where the largest and smallest elements alternate (largest, smallest, second largest, second smallest, etc.).
4. **Beauty Calculation**: The beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged array.

### Correctness Check:
The key to maximizing the beauty is to maximize the differences between consecutive elements. The provided program achieves this by alternating between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted array. This strategy ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are as large as possible.

Let's consider the example given in the problem:
- **First Test Case**: Input array is `[2, 1, 3]`. After sorting, it becomes `[1, 2, 3]`. The rearranged array is `[3, 1, 2]` or `[3, 2, 1]` (both yield the same beauty). The beauty is `(3-1) + (2-1) = 2` or `(3-2) + (2-1) = 2`.
- **Second Test Case**: Input array is `[69, 69, 69]`. After sorting, it remains `[69, 69, 69]`. The rearranged array is `[69, 69, 69]`. The beauty is `(69-69) + (69-69) = 0`.
- **Third Test Case**: Input array is `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`. After sorting, it becomes `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`. The rearranged array is `[100, 43, 90, 54, 80]`. The beauty is `(100-43) + (90-43) + (80-54) = 57`.
- **Fourth Test Case**: Input array is `[3, 4, 3, 3]`. After sorting, it becomes `[3, 3, 3, 4]`. The rearranged array is `[4, 3, 3, 3]`. The beauty is `(4-3) + (3-3) + (3-3) = 1`.
- **Fifth Test Case**: Input array is `[2, 1]`. After sorting, it becomes `[1, 2]`. The rearranged array is `[2, 1]`. The beauty is `(2-1) = 1`.

The program correctly computes the maximum beauty for each test case as demonstrated by the examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
