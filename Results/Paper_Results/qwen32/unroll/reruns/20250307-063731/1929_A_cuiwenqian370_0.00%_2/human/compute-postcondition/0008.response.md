To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's analyze the given loop and the initial state.

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. In each iteration, it adds the absolute difference between `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i - 1]` to `max_beauty`. Given that `new_arr` is a rearranged list of `arr` with elements paired from largest to smallest, the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr` will be calculated and summed up in `max_beauty`.

Since `new_arr` is sorted in a specific order (largest to smallest), the absolute difference between consecutive elements will simply be the difference between these elements because they are already in descending order.

Let's summarize the changes:
- `max_beauty` will be updated to the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements of `new_arr`.
- `arr`, `n`, `left`, `right`, and the structure of `new_arr` will remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state will have `max_beauty` updated to the sum of the differences, while other variables remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`new_arr` is a rearranged list of `arr` with elements paired from largest to smallest, `left` is `n`, `right` is `n - 1`, `arr` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `max_beauty` is the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements of `new_arr`.**
