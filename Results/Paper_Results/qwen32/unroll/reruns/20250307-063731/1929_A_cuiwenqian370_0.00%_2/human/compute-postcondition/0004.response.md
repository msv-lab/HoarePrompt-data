To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the condition `left <= right`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100
- `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9
- `new_arr` is an empty list
- `left` is 0
- `right` is `n - 1`

The condition `left <= right` should be true for the loop to execute at least once. Given the initial values:
- `left` is 0
- `right` is `n - 1`, and since `n` is at least 2, `right` is at least 1.

Since `left` is 0 and `right` is at least 1, the condition `left <= right` is always true. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state to ensure the first iteration of the loop can proceed.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `new_arr` is an empty list; `left` is 0; `right` is `n - 1`.**
