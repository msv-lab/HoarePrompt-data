You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, arr)
    results.append(result)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        else:
            new_arr.append(arr[right])
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
    return max_beauty



- Function Summary: 
The function takes an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers, rearranges the list by pairing the largest and smallest elements consecutively, and returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements of this rearranged list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's first understand the problem and the provided solution.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to maximize the "beauty" of an array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements. The beauty is calculated as:
\[ \text{beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ \text{beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} a_i - \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} a_i \]
This means that to maximize the beauty, we need to maximize the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution sorts the array and then rearranges it in an alternating fashion (largest, smallest, second largest, second smallest, etc.). This rearrangement is intended to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

Let's break down the steps:
1. **Sorting the Array**: This helps in easily picking the largest and smallest elements.
2. **Rearranging the Array**: By placing the largest and smallest elements alternately, the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
3. **Calculating the Beauty**: The beauty is then calculated by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged array.

### Verification:
Let's verify the solution with the provided examples:
1. **First Example**:
   - Input: `2 1 3`
   - Sorted: `1 2 3`
   - Rearranged: `3 1 2`
   - Beauty: `(1-3) + (2-1) = -2 + 1 = 1` (absolute value: `2`)
   - Correct Output: `2`

2. **Second Example**:
   - Input: `69 69 69`
   - Sorted: `69 69 69`
   - Rearranged: `69 69 69`
   - Beauty: `(69-69) + (69-69) = 0`
   - Correct Output: `0`

3. **Third Example**:
   - Input: `100 54 80 43 90`
   - Sorted: `43 54 80 90 100`
   - Rearranged: `100 43 90 54 80`
   - Beauty: `(43-100) + (90-43) + (54-90) + (80-54) = -57 + 47 - 36 + 26 = -20` (absolute value: `57`)
   - Correct Output: `57`

4. **Fourth Example**:
   - Input: `3 4 3 3`
   - Sorted: `3 3 3 4`
   - Rearranged: `4 3 3 3`
   - Beauty: `(3-4) + (3-3) + (3-3) = -1 + 0 + 0 = -1` (absolute value: `1`)
   - Correct Output: `1`

5. **Fifth Example**:
   - Input: `2 1`
   - Sorted: `1 2`
   - Rearranged: `2 1`
   - Beauty: `(1-2) = -1` (absolute value: `1`)
   - Correct Output: `1`

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly rearranges the array to maximize the beauty and calculates the beauty accurately. Therefore, the solution is correct.
