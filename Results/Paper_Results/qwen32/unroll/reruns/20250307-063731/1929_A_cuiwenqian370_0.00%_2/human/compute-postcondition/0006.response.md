The code snippet initializes the variable `max_beauty` to 0. This does not affect any of the other variables (`new_arr`, `left`, `right`, `arr`, `n`), which retain their initial values. 

Output State: **`new_arr` is a rearranged list of `arr` with elements paired from largest to smallest, `left` is `n`, `right` is `n - 1`, `arr` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `max_beauty` is 0**.
