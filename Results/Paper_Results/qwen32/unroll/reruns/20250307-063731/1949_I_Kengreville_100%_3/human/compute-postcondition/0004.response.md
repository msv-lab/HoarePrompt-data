Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `x` is a list of `None` with length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` with length `n`, `r` is a list of `None` with length `n`, `visited` is a list of `False` with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` with length `n`.**

In this output state, the variable `visited` has been updated to be a list of `False` values, each corresponding to the length `n`. All other variables retain their initial states.
