The code snippet `coef = [None] * n` reassigns the `coef` variable to a new list of `None` values with length `n`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, or `visited`, as it only modifies the `coef` list.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `x` is a list of `None` with length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` with length `n`, `r` is a list of `None` with length `n`, `visited` is a list of `False` with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` with length `n`.**
