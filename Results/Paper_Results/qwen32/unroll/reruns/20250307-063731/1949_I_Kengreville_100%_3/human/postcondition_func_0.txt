The function reads input for the number of disks and their respective center coordinates and radii. It then performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) on the disks to determine if they can be partitioned into two groups such that no two disks in the same group intersect. If such a partition is possible and at least one disk is counted in the DFS traversal, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
