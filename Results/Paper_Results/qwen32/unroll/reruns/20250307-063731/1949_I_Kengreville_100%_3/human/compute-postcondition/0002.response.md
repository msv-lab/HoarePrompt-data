Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `x` is a list of `None` with length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers, `visited` is a list of `None` with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` with length `n`.**

Explanation: The variable `y` is reassigned to be a list of `None` with the same length as `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
