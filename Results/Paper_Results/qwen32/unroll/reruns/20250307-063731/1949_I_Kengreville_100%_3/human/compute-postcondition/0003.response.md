The code snippet `r = [None] * n` reassigns the list `r` to be a new list of `None` values with the same length `n`. This means the previous contents of `r` are discarded and replaced with a new list of `None` values of length `n`. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `visited`, `coef`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `x` is a list of `None` with length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` with length `n`, `r` is a list of `None` with length `n`, `visited` is a list of `None` with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` with length `n`.**
