i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the number of disks. x, y, and r are lists of integers where x[i] and y[i] represent the integer coordinates of the center of the i-th disk, and r[i] represents the radius of the i-th disk. visited is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited in the DFS. coef is a list of integers used to assign coefficients for bipartite checking. tot is a variable used to accumulate the total of the coefficients. bipartite is a boolean variable used to check if the graph is bipartite.
