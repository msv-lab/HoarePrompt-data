Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, we can analyze what is printed by the `print` statement.

### Analysis:
- **`n`**: An input integer representing the length of the lists `x`, `y`, and `r`.
- **`x`, `y`, `r`**: Lists of integers, each with length `n`.
- **`visited`**: A list of boolean values, all set to `True`, indicating that all nodes have been visited.
- **`coef`**: A list of `None` values with some `1`s at indices that were starting points of DFS (Depth-First Search).
- **`tot`**: An integer reflecting the last DFS traversal where `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not `0`.
- **`bipartite`**: A boolean reflecting the last DFS traversal where `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not `0`.
- **`ok`**: A boolean indicating that at least one DFS traversal resulted in `bipartite` being `True` and `tot` being non-zero.

The provided `print` statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Explanation:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`. None of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state are involved in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will simply be the string `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
