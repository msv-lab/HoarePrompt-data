The code snippet provided is simply reading an integer input and assigning it to the variable `n`. This does not affect the other variables (`x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef`), which retain their initial states. Therefore, the only change is the value of `n` being updated to the integer input provided.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers where `x[i]` and `y[i]` are the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk and `r[i]` is the radius of the i-th disk, with -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9 for all i in the range [0, n-1]. `visited` and `coef` are lists of length `n` initialized to `None`.**
