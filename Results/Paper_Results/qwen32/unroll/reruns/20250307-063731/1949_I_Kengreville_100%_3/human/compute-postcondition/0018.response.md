Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of disks), `x` (a list of integers representing the x-coordinates of the centers of the disks), `y` (a list of integers representing the y-coordinates of the centers of the disks), and `r` (a list of integers representing the radii of the disks). The function also uses two lists, `visited` and `coef`, initialized to `None` to track visited nodes and coefficients during a DFS traversal. The function returns a value based on the DFS traversal of the disks, but the specific return value is not detailed in the given output constraints.**
