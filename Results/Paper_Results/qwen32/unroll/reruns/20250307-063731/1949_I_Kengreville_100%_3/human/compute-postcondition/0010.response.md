Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of `False` with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` with length `n`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`.**

In this output state, the only change from the initial state is the introduction of the variable `ok`, which has been assigned the value `False`. All other variables retain their initial values.
