Postcondition: **`n` is the input integer, `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of `True` with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` with some `1`s at indices that were starting points of DFS, `tot` is an integer reflecting the last DFS traversal where `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not `0`, `bipartite` is a boolean reflecting the last DFS traversal where `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not `0`. If `ok` is `True`, it indicates that at least one DFS traversal resulted in `bipartite` being `True` and `tot` being non-zero. Otherwise, `ok` is `False`, indicating that no DFS traversal resulted in `bipartite` being `True` and `tot` being non-zero.**
