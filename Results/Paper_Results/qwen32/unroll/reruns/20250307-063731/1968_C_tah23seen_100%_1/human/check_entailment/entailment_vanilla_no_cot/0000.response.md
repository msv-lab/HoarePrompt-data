Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The function `func_1` is supposed to generate an array `a` such that `a[i] % a[i-1] = x[i]` for all `2 <= i <= n`. However, the current implementation incorrectly calculates the values of `a` by subtracting `x[i]` from `a[i+1]`, which does not guarantee that the modulo condition will be satisfied.

Here's a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1  # We can choose a_1 to be any number greater than x_2
    for i in range(1, n):
        ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + arr[i]  # a_i = a_(i-1) + x_i will satisfy a_i % a_(i-1) = x_i
    return ans
```

In this corrected version, `a_1` is chosen to be `x_2 + 1` (or any number greater than `x_2`), and for each subsequent `a_i`, we set `a_i = a_(i-1) + x_i`. This ensures that `a_i % a_(i-1) = x_i` because `a_i` is exactly `x_i` more than `a_(i-1)`, thus the remainder when `a_i` is divided by `a_(i-1)` is `x_i`.
