You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        i -= 1
    return ans



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 499 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 0 <= i < len(arr). n is an integer such that n = len(arr) + 1 and 2 <= n <= 500.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        i -= 1
        
    #State: 
    return ans
    #The program returns the value of `ans`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` and an integer `n` (where `n` is the length of `arr` plus one) and returns a list `ans` of length `n`. The list `ans` is constructed such that each element at index `i` (except the last one) is the result of subtracting the corresponding element in `arr` from the element at index `i + 1` in `ans`. The initial value of the last element in `ans` is set to \(10^9\).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the array \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) such that \( x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).

Let's analyze the given code:

```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        i -= 1
    return ans
```

The function `func_1` initializes the array `ans` with \( 10^9 \) for all elements and then tries to fill in the values by subtracting the corresponding \( x_i \) from the next element in `ans`. This approach is incorrect because it does not guarantee that the modulo condition \( x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1} \) will be satisfied.

### Example of incorrectness:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3
1 1
```
The correct output should be an array \( a_1, a_2, a_3 \) such that:
- \( a_2 \mod a_1 = 1 \)
- \( a_3 \mod a_2 = 1 \)

One possible correct output could be:
```
2 3 4
```
Here:
- \( 3 \mod 2 = 1 \)
- \( 4 \mod 3 = 1 \)

However, the provided code will output:
```
1000000000 999999999 1000000000
```
This output is clearly incorrect because:
- \( 999999999 \mod 1000000000 = 999999999 \neq 1 \)
- \( 1000000000 \mod 999999999 = 1 \) (this part is correct, but the first part is not)

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we can set \( a_1 \) to any value greater than the maximum \( x_i \) (to ensure all \( x_i \) can be remainders) and then set \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i \) for \( i \ge 2 \). This ensures that \( a_i \mod a_{i-1} = x_i \).

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [max(arr) + 1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + arr[i - 1]
    return ans
```

This approach ensures that the modulo condition is satisfied for all \( i \).
