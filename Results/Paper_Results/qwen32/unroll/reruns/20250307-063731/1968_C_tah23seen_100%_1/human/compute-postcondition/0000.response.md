The code snippet initializes a list `ans` with `n` elements, all set to the value `10 ** 9`. The initial state specifies that `arr` is a list of integers with a length between 1 and 499, and each element of `arr` is between 1 and 500. The variable `n` is defined as `len(arr) + 1`, and thus `n` is between 2 and 500.

After executing the code snippet, the list `ans` is created with `n` elements, each having the value `10 ** 9`. The values of `arr` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 499 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 0 <= i < len(arr); `n` is an integer such that n = len(arr) + 1 and 2 <= n <= 500; `ans` is a list of `n` integers where each element is 10 ** 9.**
