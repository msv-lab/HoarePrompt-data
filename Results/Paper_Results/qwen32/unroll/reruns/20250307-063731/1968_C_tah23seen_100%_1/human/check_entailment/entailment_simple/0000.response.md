Reasoning: 

The given program is intended to solve the problem by constructing an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions. However, the implementation of the function `func_1` is incorrect. Let's analyze the logic and the expected behavior.

The function `func_1` is supposed to create an array `ans` such that:
- `1 <= ans[i] <= 10^9` for all `1 <= i <= n`
- `arr[i] = ans[i+1] % ans[i]` for all `2 <= i <= n`

The current implementation of `func_1` initializes `ans` with `10^9` for all elements and then iterates backward from the second last element, setting `ans[i]` to `ans[i+1] - arr[i]`. This approach does not guarantee that the conditions will be met and can result in negative values or values that do not satisfy the modulo condition.

Let's consider a correct approach:
1. Set `ans[n-1]` to any value greater than or equal to `arr[n-2]` and less than or equal to `10^9` (since `arr[n-2]` is the last element of `arr` and `ans[n-1]` should be greater than `arr[n-2]` to satisfy `arr[n-2] = ans[n-1] % ans[n-2]`).
2. For each `i` from `n-2` down to `1`, set `ans[i]` to `arr[i] + k * ans[i+1]` where `k` is chosen such that `1 <= ans[i] <= 10^9`. A simple choice is `k = 0`, so `ans[i] = arr[i] + 0 * ans[i+1] = arr[i] + ans[i+1]`.

Here is a correct implementation of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[n-1] = arr[n-2] + 1  # Ensure ans[n-1] > arr[n-2]
    for i in range(n-2, 0, -1):
        ans[i] = arr[i-1] + ans[i+1]
    ans[0] = ans[1] + 1  # Ensure ans[0] > ans[1]
    return ans
```

Given the incorrect implementation in the annotated program, the output will not necessarily satisfy the conditions specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
