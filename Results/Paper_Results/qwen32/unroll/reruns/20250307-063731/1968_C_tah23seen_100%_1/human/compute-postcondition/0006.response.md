Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` and an integer `n` (where `n` is the length of `arr` plus one) and returns a list `ans` of length `n`. The list `ans` is constructed such that each element at index `i` (except the last one) is the result of subtracting the corresponding element in `arr` from the element at index `i + 1` in `ans`. The initial value of the last element in `ans` is set to \(10^9\).**
