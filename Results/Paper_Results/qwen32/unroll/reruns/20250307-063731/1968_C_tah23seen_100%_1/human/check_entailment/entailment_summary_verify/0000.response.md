### Reasoning:

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to find the array \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) such that \( x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).

Let's break down the provided code and the function summary:

1. **Initialization**: The function `func_1` initializes an array `ans` of length `n` with all elements set to \( 10^9 \).
2. **Loop**: The loop iterates from the second-to-last element to the first element of `ans`, setting each element to the value of the next element minus the corresponding value in `arr`.

This approach is flawed because:
- Subtracting \( x_i \) from \( 10^9 \) does not guarantee that the result will satisfy \( x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1} \).
- The values generated do not respect the modulo condition consistently across all elements.

To illustrate, consider the example provided in the original assessment:
- **Input**: `1 3 1 1`
- **Expected Output**: An array \( a_1, a_2, a_3 \) such that:
  - \( a_2 \mod a_1 = 1 \)
  - \( a_3 \mod a_2 = 1 \)
- **Provided Code Output**: `1000000000 999999999 1000000000`
- **Explanation**: 
  - \( 999999999 \mod 1000000000 = 999999999 \neq 1 \)
  - \( 1000000000 \mod 999999999 = 1 \) (this part is correct, but the first part is not)

The correct approach, as suggested in the original assessment, is to set \( a_1 \) to a value greater than the maximum \( x_i \) and then set \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i \) for \( i \ge 2 \). This ensures that \( a_i \mod a_{i-1} = x_i \).

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [max(arr) + 1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + arr[i - 1]
    return ans
```

This approach ensures that the modulo condition is satisfied for all \( i \).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
