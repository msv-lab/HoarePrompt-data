Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires constructing an array \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) such that:
1. \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \) for all \( 1 \le i \le n \).
2. \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).

The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, we are given \( n \) and \( x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n \).

### Given Program Analysis

The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads \( n \) and the array \( x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n \). It then calls `func_1(arr, n)` to compute the required array \( a \).

Let's look at the function `func_1(arr, n)`:

```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        i -= 1
    return ans
```

### Issues in the Program

1. **Initialization of `ans`**: The array `ans` is initialized with all elements set to \( 10^9 \). This is not necessarily a problem by itself, but it does not guarantee that the constructed array will satisfy the conditions.
2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The core logic of the function is incorrect. It attempts to set `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, which does not guarantee that `ans[i] % ans[i + 1] = arr[i]`. This logic does not follow the problem requirements.

### Correct Approach

To construct the array \( a \) such that \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \), we can use the following approach:
1. Set \( a_1 \) to any value greater than or equal to \( x_2 \) (since \( x_2 = a_2 \bmod a_1 \)).
2. For each subsequent element, set \( a_i \) to \( x_i + k \cdot a_{i-1} \) where \( k \) is any non-negative integer. A simple choice is \( k = 0 \), which gives \( a_i = x_i + a_{i-1} \).

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1  # a_1 can be any value > x_2, we choose x_2 + 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        ans[i] = arr[i] + ans[i - 1]
    return ans
```

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the array \( a \) that satisfies the given conditions. The logic in `func_1` is flawed.

Correctness: **False**
