Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to generate an array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` based on the given array `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n` such that `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`. However, the current implementation of the function `func_1` does not correctly achieve this.

The function `func_1` initializes all elements of the `ans` array to \(10^9\) and then iterates backwards from the second last element to the first, setting each element to be the difference between the next element and the corresponding element in `arr`. This logic does not align with the requirement that `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}`.

To satisfy the problem's requirements, a correct approach would be to construct the `ans` array such that each `a_i` is a number that, when taken modulo `a_{i-1}`, results in `x_i`. One straightforward way to do this is to set `a_1` to a sufficiently large number (like \(10^9\)) and then set `a_i` to `x_i + a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`. This guarantees that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` because `x_i` is always less than `a_{i-1}` (since `x_i <= 500` and `a_{i-1}` is at least \(10^9\)).

Given the current implementation, the program does not correctly generate the required array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

Correctness: **False**
