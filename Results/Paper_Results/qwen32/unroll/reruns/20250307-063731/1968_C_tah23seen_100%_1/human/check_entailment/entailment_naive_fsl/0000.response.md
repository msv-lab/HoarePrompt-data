Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the array \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) such that \( x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).

Let's analyze the given code:

```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        i -= 1
    return ans
```

The function `func_1` initializes the array `ans` with \( 10^9 \) for all elements and then tries to fill in the values by subtracting the corresponding \( x_i \) from the next element in `ans`. This approach is incorrect because it does not guarantee that the modulo condition \( x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1} \) will be satisfied.

### Example of incorrectness:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3
1 1
```
The correct output should be an array \( a_1, a_2, a_3 \) such that:
- \( a_2 \mod a_1 = 1 \)
- \( a_3 \mod a_2 = 1 \)

One possible correct output could be:
```
2 3 4
```
Here:
- \( 3 \mod 2 = 1 \)
- \( 4 \mod 3 = 1 \)

However, the provided code will output:
```
1000000000 999999999 1000000000
```
This output is clearly incorrect because:
- \( 999999999 \mod 1000000000 = 999999999 \neq 1 \)
- \( 1000000000 \mod 999999999 = 1 \) (this part is correct, but the first part is not)

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we can set \( a_1 \) to any value greater than the maximum \( x_i \) (to ensure all \( x_i \) can be remainders) and then set \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i \) for \( i \ge 2 \). This ensures that \( a_i \mod a_{i-1} = x_i \).

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [max(arr) + 1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + arr[i - 1]
    return ans
```

This approach ensures that the modulo condition is satisfied for all \( i \).
