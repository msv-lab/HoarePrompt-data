To understand the output state, we need to carefully analyze the given loop and how it modifies the `ans` list.

### Initial State Recap:
- `arr` is a list of integers with length between 1 and 499, and each element in `arr` is between 1 and 500.
- `n` is the length of `arr` plus one.
- `ans` is a list of `n` integers, all initialized to 10.
- `i` is initialized to `len(arr) - 1`.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop runs while `i` is greater than or equal to 0. In each iteration, it performs the following steps:
1. It updates the `ans[i]` element by setting it to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`.
2. It decrements `i` by 1.

### Iteration Details:
- **First Iteration (i = len(arr) - 1):**
  - `ans[len(arr) - 1] = ans[len(arr)] - arr[len(arr) - 1]`
  - Since `ans[len(arr)]` is 10 (the initial value), `ans[len(arr) - 1]` becomes `10 - arr[len(arr) - 1]`.
  
- **Second Iteration (i = len(arr) - 2):**
  - `ans[len(arr) - 2] = ans[len(arr) - 1] - arr[len(arr) - 2]`
  - `ans[len(arr) - 1]` was just updated to `10 - arr[len(arr) - 1]`, so `ans[len(arr) - 2]` becomes `(10 - arr[len(arr) - 1]) - arr[len(arr) - 2]`.
  
- **Continuing this pattern:**
  - Each element `ans[i]` is calculated as `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, which is equivalent to `10 - (arr[len(arr) - 1] + arr[len(arr) - 2] + ... + arr[i])`.

### Final State:
- By the end of the loop, the `ans` list will have been modified such that each element `ans[i]` is `10` minus the sum of all elements in `arr` from index `i` to the end of the list.
- The last element `ans[n-1]` (which is `ans[len(arr)]`) remains unchanged at 10.

### Output State:
- The first element `ans[0]` will be `10 - (arr[0] + arr[1] + ... + arr[len(arr) - 1])`.
- The second element `ans[1]` will be `10 - (arr[1] + arr[2] + ... + arr[len(arr) - 1])`.
- This pattern continues until the last element `ans[len(arr)]` which remains 10.

### Conclusion:
The `ans` list will have its first `len(arr)` elements updated based on the cumulative sum of elements in `arr` from the current index to the end, subtracted from 10. The last element of `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State:** **`ans` is a list where `ans[i] = 10 - sum(arr[i:])` for `0 <= i < len(arr)` and `ans[len(arr)] = 10`.**
