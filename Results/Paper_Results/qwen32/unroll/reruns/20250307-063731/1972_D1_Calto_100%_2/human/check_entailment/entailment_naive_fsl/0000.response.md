Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem as described. The function `func_2(n, m)` is supposed to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the conditions given in the problem description. However, the implementation does not correctly compute the count based on the conditions provided.

Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution:

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires counting pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Provided Solution Analysis:
The provided solution consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is intended to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\). However, the implementation is incorrect. The logic used in `func_2` does not align with the problem requirements.

### Issues in `func_2`:
- The loop runs from 1 to \(m\). This part is correct as it iterates over all possible values of \(b\).
- Inside the loop, the variables `x` and `y` are calculated in a manner that does not reflect the problem's requirements. Specifically, the calculation of `x` and `y` does not ensure that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The count is incremented based on the calculated values of `x` and `y`, but this logic is flawed and does not correctly count the valid pairs.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Let's consider a simple test case:
- Input: \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\)
- Expected Output: 3 (pairs are (1,1), (2,1), (2,2))
- Output from `func_2(2, 3)`: Incorrect result

The provided solution does not correctly compute the number of valid pairs for this or any other test case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and hence it is incorrect.
