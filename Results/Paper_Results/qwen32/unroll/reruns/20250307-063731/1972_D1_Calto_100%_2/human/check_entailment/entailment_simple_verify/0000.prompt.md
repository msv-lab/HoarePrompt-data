You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
    return cnt



- Annotated Code: 
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_2(n, m)
    print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: a is the GCD of the initial values of a and b, and b is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the GCD of the initial values of a and b, which is also the current value of a.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
        
    #State: `cnt` is the sum of `math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0)` for all `i` from `1` to `m`, starting from the initial value of `-1`.
    return cnt
    #The program returns `cnt`, which is the sum of `math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0)` for all `i` from `1` to `m`, starting from the initial value of `-1`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem as described. The function `func_2(n, m)` is supposed to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the conditions given in the problem description. However, the implementation does not correctly compute the count based on the conditions provided.

Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution:

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires counting pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Provided Solution Analysis:
The provided solution consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is intended to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\). However, the implementation is incorrect. The logic used in `func_2` does not align with the problem requirements.

### Issues in `func_2`:
- The loop runs from 1 to \(m\). This part is correct as it iterates over all possible values of \(b\).
- Inside the loop, the variables `x` and `y` are calculated in a manner that does not reflect the problem's requirements. Specifically, the calculation of `x` and `y` does not ensure that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The count is incremented based on the calculated values of `x` and `y`, but this logic is flawed and does not correctly count the valid pairs.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Let's consider a simple test case:
- Input: \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\)
- Expected Output: 3 (pairs are (1,1), (2,1), (2,2))
- Output from `func_2(2, 3)`: Incorrect result

The provided solution does not correctly compute the number of valid pairs for this or any other test case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and hence it is incorrect.
