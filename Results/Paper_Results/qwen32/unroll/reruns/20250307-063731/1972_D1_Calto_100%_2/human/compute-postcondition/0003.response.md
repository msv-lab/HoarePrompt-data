Output State: **The program returns `cnt`, which is the sum of `math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0)` for all `i` from `1` to `m`, starting from the initial value of `-1`.**

This means that `cnt` is calculated by iterating `i` from `1` to `m` and summing up the expression `math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0)` for each `i`. The initial value of `cnt` is `-1`, and the final value of `cnt` is what gets returned.
