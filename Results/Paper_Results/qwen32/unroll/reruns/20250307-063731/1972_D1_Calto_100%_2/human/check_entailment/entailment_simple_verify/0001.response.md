### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) according to the problem statement. Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - We need to find pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: This is a correct implementation of the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of `a` and `b`.
   - **Function `func_2(n, m)`**: This function attempts to count valid pairs but uses a logic that does not match the problem requirements. Specifically:
     - It initializes `cnt` to `-1`, which is incorrect.
     - The loop iterates over possible values of `b` and calculates `x` and `y` in a way that does not correspond to the problem's conditions.
     - The update to `cnt` involves `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`, which does not correctly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach involves iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This is the brute-force method, which is feasible given the constraints (since the sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^6\)).

4. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations in the annotated version provide insights into the state of the program at key points, but they do not validate the correctness of the logic used in `func_2`. The annotations describe the transformations and calculations, but they do not align with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) according to the problem statement. The original assessment is accurate in identifying this issue.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
