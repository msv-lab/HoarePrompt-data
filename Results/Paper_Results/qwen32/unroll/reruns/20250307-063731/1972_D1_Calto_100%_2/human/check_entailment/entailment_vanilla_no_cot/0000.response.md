Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down the problem and the code:

The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the provided code does not follow this logic. Instead, it contains a function `func_1` that correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers, but `func_2` does not correctly count the valid pairs.

The function `func_2` seems to be trying to count the number of valid pairs but does so in a way that doesn't match the problem's requirements. The logic inside `func_2` does not check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for all pairs (a, b).

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges and check if the condition is satisfied for each pair. Here's a sketch of what a correct solution might look like:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            gcd_ab = math.gcd(a, b)
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd_ab) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    m = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    results.append(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This code correctly counts the number of valid pairs for each test case by checking the condition for each pair (a, b) within the specified ranges.
