### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **`func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - It is not used in `func_2`, so it doesn't directly impact the correctness of the solution for the problem.

2. **`func_2(n, m)`**:
   - This function is intended to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).
   - The loop runs from 1 to \(m\), which is correct as it iterates over all possible values of \(b\).
   - Inside the loop, the variables `x` and `y` are calculated as:
     - \(x = n - (i * i - i)\)
     - \(y = i * i\)
   - The count is incremented based on the calculated values of `x` and `y` using the formula:
     - `cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`
   - The initial value of `cnt` is `-1`.

#### Issues with `func_2`:
- The logic used in `func_2` to count valid pairs does not align with the problem requirements.
- The formula `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` does not correctly determine if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The values of `x` and `y` are not directly related to the problem's conditions.

#### Example of Incorrectness:
Let's consider a simple test case:
- Input: \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\)
- Expected Output: 3 (pairs are (1,1), (2,1), (2,2))
- Output from `func_2(2, 3)`: Incorrect result

The provided solution does not correctly compute the number of valid pairs for this or any other test case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and hence it is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
