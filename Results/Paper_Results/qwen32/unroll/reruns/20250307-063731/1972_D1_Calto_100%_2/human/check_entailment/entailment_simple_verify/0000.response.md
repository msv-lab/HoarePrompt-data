### Reasoning:
Let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the provided program using the problem description, the program code, and the annotated version of the code.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The annotation confirms that `a` is the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b` at the end of the function.

2. **Function `func_2(n, m)`**:
   - This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).
   - The loop iterates over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`.
   - Inside the loop, `x` and `y` are calculated as:
     - `x = n - (i * i - i)`
     - `y = i * i`
   - The count `cnt` is incremented by:
     - `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`
   - The annotation confirms that `cnt` is the sum of `math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0)` for all `i` from `1` to `m`, starting from the initial value of `-1`.

#### Issues in `func_2`:
- The logic for calculating `x` and `y` does not align with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the problem requires checking whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), but the provided logic does not do this.
- The calculation `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not reflect the condition \(a + b = k \cdot (b \cdot \gcd(a, b))\) for some integer \(k\).

#### Verification with Example:
Let's consider the test case \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\):
- Expected Output: 3 (pairs are (1,1), (2,1), (2,2))
- Output from `func_2(2, 3)`:
  - For \(i = 1\):
    - `x = 2 - (1*1 - 1) = 2`
    - `y = 1*1 = 1`
    - `cnt = -1 + math.ceil(2/1) + (2 % 1 == 0) = -1 + 2 + 1 = 2`
  - For \(i = 2\):
    - `x = 2 - (2*2 - 2) = 2 - 2 = 0`
    - `y = 2*2 = 4`
    - `cnt = 2 + math.ceil(0/4) + (0 % 4 == 0) = 2 + 0 + 1 = 3`
  - For \(i = 3\):
    - `x = 2 - (3*3 - 3) = 2 - 6 = -4`
    - `y = 3*3 = 9`
    - `cnt = 3 + math.ceil(-4/9) + (-4 % 9 == 0) = 3 + 0 + 0 = 3`
- The output `3` seems correct for this example, but this alone is not sufficient to prove the correctness of the function for all cases.

#### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly compute the number of valid pairs for the general case. The logic in `func_2` does not align with the problem's requirements, and the annotations do not provide a correct explanation of how the function is supposed to work.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
