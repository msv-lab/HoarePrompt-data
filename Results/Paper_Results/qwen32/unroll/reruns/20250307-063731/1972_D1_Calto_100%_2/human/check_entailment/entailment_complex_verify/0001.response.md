### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. This part is accurate and irrelevant to the main issue with `func_2`.

2. **Function `func_2(n, m)`**:
   - The logic in `func_2` is flawed. It attempts to count valid pairs \((a, b)\) by iterating through values of `b` and calculating `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`, then updating `cnt` based on these calculations. This does not align with the problem's requirement to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The correct approach involves iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition \( (a + b) \% (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0 \).

### Annotations:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points, but they do not challenge the incorrect logic of `func_2`. They simply describe what the code is doing, which is not aligned with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The program needs to be rewritten to properly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
