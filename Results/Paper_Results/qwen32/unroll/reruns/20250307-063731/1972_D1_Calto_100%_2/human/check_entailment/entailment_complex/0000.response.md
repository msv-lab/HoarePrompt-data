### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the given code to see if it accurately solves the problem as described.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Code Overview:
1. **func_1(a, b)**: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. It is correctly implemented as per the Euclidean algorithm.
2. **func_2(n, m)**: This function calculates the number of valid pairs (a, b) for given `n` and `m`.

### Analysis of `func_2(n, m)`:
The function `func_2(n, m)` iterates over `i` from 1 to `m` and calculates a sum `cnt` using the formula:
\[ \text{cnt} = \text{cnt} + \left\lceil \frac{n - (i \cdot i - i)}{i \cdot i} \right\rceil + ((n - (i \cdot i - i)) \% (i \cdot i) == 0) \]

Let's dissect this formula:
- \( n - (i \cdot i - i) \) simplifies to \( n - i \cdot (i - 1) \).
- The term \( \left\lceil \frac{n - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i \cdot i} \right\rceil \) calculates the number of multiples of \( i^2 \) starting from \( i \cdot (i - 1) + 1 \) up to \( n \).
- The term \( ((n - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% (i \cdot i) == 0) \) adds 1 if \( n - i \cdot (i - 1) \) is exactly divisible by \( i^2 \).

This formula is derived from the condition that \( a + b \) must be a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \). Given the constraints, it effectively counts the number of valid pairs (a, b) for each `b` from 1 to `m`.

However, there is an initial value of `cnt` set to `-1`, which is incorrect. The initial value should be `0` because we are summing up counts from 0. The presence of `-1` will result in an incorrect count for all test cases.

### Correctness:
The logic in `func_2` seems correct, but the initial value of `cnt` is wrong. This will lead to incorrect results for all test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the incorrect initial value of `cnt` in `func_2`.

#### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
