### Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's analyze the provided code and see if it correctly addresses this problem:

#### Function `func_1(a, b)`:
This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. The function is correctly implemented and returns the GCD, which is used in the problem to check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Function `func_2(n, m)`:
This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given `n` and `m`. The implementation of `func_2` is not straightforward and seems to be an optimized version of the problem. Let's break down the logic:

- The loop iterates over `i` from `1` to `m`.
- For each `i`, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)`.
- It then calculates `y = i * i`.
- The count `cnt` is updated by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

The logic seems to be derived from the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here, `i` represents `b`, and `x` and `y` are derived in a way that simplifies the counting of valid `a` values for each `b`.

However, looking at the given example outputs, it seems the provided `func_2` implementation does not match the expected results. Let's verify the implementation with the example cases:

1. For `n = 1`, `m = 1`:
   - Only pair is `(1, 1)`, which satisfies the condition. The function should return `1`.

2. For `n = 2`, `m = 3`:
   - Valid pairs are `(1, 1)`, `(2, 1)`, `(2, 2)`. The function should return `3`.

3. For `n = 10`, `m = 8`:
   - Valid pairs are `(1, 1)`, `(2, 1)`, `(2, 2)`, `(3, 1)`, `(4, 1)`, `(5, 1)`, `(6, 1)`, `(6, 2)`, `(6, 3)`, `(7, 1)`, `(8, 1)`, `(9, 1)`, `(10, 1)`, `(10, 2)`. The function should return `14`.

Given the above analysis and the example outputs, it is clear that the provided `func_2` implementation does not correctly count the valid pairs. The logic in `func_2` seems to be incorrect or not correctly derived from the problem's conditions.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
