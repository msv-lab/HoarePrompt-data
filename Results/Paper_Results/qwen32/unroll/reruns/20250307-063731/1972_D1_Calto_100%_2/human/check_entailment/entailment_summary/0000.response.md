Reasoning:
The provided program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. The main program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and then calls `func_2(n, m)` to compute the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions. Let's analyze the correctness of the functions in the context of the problem.

### Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`
- **Purpose**: To compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b`.
- **Implementation**: The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD, which is correct and efficient.
- **Output Hints**: Consistent with the description, it returns the GCD of `a` and `b`.

However, `func_1` is not used in `func_2`, which is the function that computes the result for each test case. So, we can ignore `func_1` for the correctness of the overall program.

### Function 2: `func_2(n, m)`
- **Purpose**: To compute the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
- **Implementation**: The function iterates over each integer `i` from 1 to `m` and computes a value based on `n` and `i`. It then adds this value to `cnt`. The initial value of `cnt` is `-1`, which seems incorrect since the number of valid pairs should be non-negative.

Let's analyze the logic inside `func_2` to see if it correctly counts the number of valid pairs:
- **Formula**: For each `i`, the function calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`. It then adds `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` to `cnt`.
- **Correctness**: The formula seems to be derived based on some mathematical observation related to the problem. However, the initial value of `cnt` being `-1` is suspicious. If `cnt` should count the number of valid pairs, it should start from `0`.

Let's consider the first test case:
- **Input**: `n = 1`, `m = 1`
- **Expected Output**: `1` (only pair is `(1, 1)`)
- **Actual Calculation**:
  - For `i = 1`, `x = 1 - (1 * 1 - 1) = 1`, `y = 1 * 1 = 1`
  - `math.ceil(1 / 1) + (1 % 1 == 0) = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - `cnt = -1 + 2 = 1` (which is correct)

Let's consider another test case:
- **Input**: `n = 2`, `m = 3`
- **Expected Output**: `3` (pairs are `(1, 1)`, `(2, 1)`, `(2, 2)`)
- **Actual Calculation**:
  - For `i = 1`, `x = 2 - (1 * 1 - 1) = 2`, `y = 1 * 1 = 1`
  - `math.ceil(2 / 1) + (2 % 1 == 0) = 2 + 1 = 3`
  - For `i = 2`, `x = 2 - (2 * 2 - 2) = -2`, `y = 2 * 2 = 4`
  - `math.ceil(-2 / 4) + (-2 % 4 == 0) = 0 + 0 = 0`
  - For `i = 3`, `x = 2 - (3 * 3 - 3) = -6`, `y = 3 * 3 = 9`
  - `math.ceil(-6 / 9) + (-6 % 9 == 0) = 0 + 0 = 0`
  - `cnt = -1 + 3 + 0 + 0 = 2` (which is incorrect)

The above analysis shows that the function does not correctly compute the number of valid pairs for all test cases. The initial value of `cnt` being `-1` is likely the cause of the incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because `func_2` does not correctly compute the number of valid pairs for all test cases due to the incorrect initial value of `cnt`.

Correctness: **False**
