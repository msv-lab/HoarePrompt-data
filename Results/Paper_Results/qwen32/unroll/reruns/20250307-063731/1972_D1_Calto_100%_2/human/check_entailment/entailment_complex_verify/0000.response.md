### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the provided program and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Requirements:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Program:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: Computes the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: Intended to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\).

#### Analysis of `func_2(n, m)`:
The core logic in `func_2(n, m)` is as follows:
```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
    return cnt
```
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- `cnt` is initialized to `-1`.
- For each `i` from `1` to `m`, the program calculates `x` and `y` and updates `cnt` based on these calculations.

#### Issues in `func_2`:
- The logic for counting valid pairs does not align with the problem's requirements.
- The calculations of `x` and `y` do not ensure that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The initial value of `cnt` being `-1` is also suspicious as it should start from `0`.

#### Example Analysis:
Let's consider the test case \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\):
- Expected Output: 3 (pairs are (1,1), (2,1), (2,2))
- The provided program does not correctly compute the number of valid pairs for this test case.

#### Verification Using Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program but do not provide a correct mapping of these states to the problem requirements. The annotations confirm the calculations of `x` and `y` but do not validate that these calculations lead to the correct count of valid pairs.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem as described. The logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not ensure that the pairs \((a, b)\) satisfy the conditions given in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
