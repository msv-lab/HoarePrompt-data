### Reasoning:

Let's carefully evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, the program code, and the annotations provided.

#### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s followed by all 1s) using the minimum cost of cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length \( k \) is \( k \).

#### Key Observations:
1. **Objective**: To sort the binary string with minimal cost, we need to move all 0s to the left of all 1s.
2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - For each 0 that appears after a 1, we need to perform a cyclic shift to bring it to the left of the 1s. The cost of such a shift is the length of the substring that includes the 0 and all preceding 1s.
   - The cost for each 1 that appears before a 0 can be thought of as the number of 0s that need to be moved to the left of this 1.

#### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the provided program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)
```

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( n \) and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the binary string and converts it into a list of integers (0s and 1s).

2. **Counting Zeroes**:
   - It counts the total number of 0s in the string using `zeroes = s.count(0)`.

3. **Counters and Cost Calculation**:
   - `cnt` is a list that keeps track of the count of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - `ans` is the variable that accumulates the total cost.
   - The program iterates through the string:
     - For each 0 encountered, if there are any 1s before it (`cnt[1] > 0`), it adds 1 to the cost (`ans += 1`).
     - For each 1 encountered, it adds the number of 0s that have not been encountered yet (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to the cost.

#### Correctness Analysis:
The program's logic for cost calculation is flawed. The cost should be the length of the substring that includes the 0 and all preceding 1s, which is not correctly captured by the provided logic. Specifically:
- The cost for each 0 encountered after a 1 should be the number of 1s seen so far, not just 1.
- The cost for each 1 encountered before a 0 should be the number of 0s that have not been encountered yet, which is correctly captured but not in the context of the correct formula for cyclic shift cost.

#### Annotated Code:
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points, but they do not challenge the flawed logic in the cost calculation. The annotations only state the values of variables and the flow of the program without providing a deeper analysis of the correctness of the cost calculation logic.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string according to the problem's requirements. The logic for calculating the cost of cyclic shifts is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
