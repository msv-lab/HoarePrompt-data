Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using the described cyclic shift operations. The logic in the program seems to be incorrect for calculating the cost in the required manner. The program appears to be counting transitions from 1 to 0 and vice versa but does not properly account for the cost of the operations as defined in the problem statement.

The correct approach involves calculating the cost based on the number of 1s that need to be moved past each 0 to sort the string. A more appropriate solution would involve iterating through the string and calculating the cost of moving each 1 to the right of each 0, considering the length of the substring being shifted. The provided program does not achieve this correctly.
