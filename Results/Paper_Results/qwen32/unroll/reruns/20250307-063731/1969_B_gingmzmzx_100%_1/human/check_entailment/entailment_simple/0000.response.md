To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic step-by-step and compare it with the problem description and example outputs.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers (0s and 1s).

2. **Counting Zeros:**
   - It counts the total number of zeros in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `zeroes`.

3. **Tracking Counts of 0s and 1s:**
   - It initializes a list `cnt` to keep track of the counts of 0s and 1s encountered so far while iterating through the string.

4. **Calculating the Minimum Cost:**
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total minimum cost to sort the string.
   - It iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`:
     - If `c` is 0, it increments the count of 0s in `cnt` and adds 1 to `ans` if there is at least one 1 encountered before (i.e., `cnt[1] > 0`). This is because moving a 0 to the left past a 1 incurs a cost.
     - If `c` is 1, it increments the count of 1s in `cnt` and adds the number of remaining zeros (total zeros minus the count of 0s encountered so far) to `ans`. This is because moving a 1 to the right past all remaining zeros incurs a cost.

5. **Output:**
   - For each test case, it prints the total minimum cost `ans` to sort the string.

### Verification with Example Inputs

Let's verify the program with the given example inputs:

1. **Input: `10`**
   - Total zeros: 1
   - Iteration:
     - `c = 1`: `cnt = [0, 1]`, `ans = 0`
     - `c = 0`: `cnt = [1, 1]`, `ans = 1` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
   - Output: `2` (Incorrect, should be 2)
   
2. **Input: `0000`**
   - Total zeros: 4
   - Iteration:
     - All characters are 0, so no cost incurred.
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

3. **Input: `11000`**
   - Total zeros: 3
   - Iteration:
     - `c = 1`: `cnt = [0, 1]`, `ans = 0`
     - `c = 1`: `cnt = [0, 2]`, `ans = 0`
     - `c = 0`: `cnt = [1, 2]`, `ans = 2` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
     - `c = 0`: `cnt = [2, 2]`, `ans = 4` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
     - `c = 0`: `cnt = [3, 2]`, `ans = 6` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
   - Output: `9` (Incorrect, should be 9)
   
4. **Input: `101011`**
   - Total zeros: 2
   - Iteration:
     - `c = 1`: `cnt = [0, 1]`, `ans = 0`
     - `c = 0`: `cnt = [1, 1]`, `ans = 1` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
     - `c = 1`: `cnt = [1, 2]`, `ans = 3` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
     - `c = 0`: `cnt = [2, 2]`, `ans = 5` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
     - `c = 1`: `cnt = [2, 3]`, `ans = 7` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
     - `c = 1`: `cnt = [2, 4]`, `ans = 9` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
   - Output: `5` (Incorrect, should be 5)
   
5. **Input: `01101001`**
   - Total zeros: 4
   - Iteration:
     - `c = 0`: `cnt = [1, 0]`, `ans = 0`
     - `c = 1`: `cnt = [1, 1]`, `ans = 0`
     - `c = 1`: `cnt = [1, 2]`, `ans = 0`
     - `c = 0`: `cnt = [2, 2]`, `ans = 2` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
     - `c = 1`: `cnt = [2, 3]`, `ans = 4` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
     - `c = 0`: `cnt = [3, 3]`, `ans = 7` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
     - `c = 0`: `cnt = [4, 3]`, `ans = 10` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
     - `c = 1`: `cnt = [4, 4]`, `ans = 11` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
   - Output: `11` (Correct)

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost in all cases. The logic for calculating the cost needs to be re-evaluated. The current logic does not accurately reflect the cost of cyclically shifting substrings to sort the binary string.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
