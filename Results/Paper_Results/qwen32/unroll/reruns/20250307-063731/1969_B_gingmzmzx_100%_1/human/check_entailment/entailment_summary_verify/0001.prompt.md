You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of a binary string `s`. For each binary string, it calculates and prints an integer value `ans` which represents the number of swaps needed to sort the binary string in non-decreasing order.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:

The task is to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s followed by all 1s) using the minimum cost of cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length \( k \) is \( k \).

### Key Observations:

1. **Objective**: To sort the binary string with minimal cost, we need to move all 0s to the left of all 1s.
2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - For each 0 that appears after a 1, we need to perform a cyclic shift to bring it to the left of the 1s. The cost of such a shift is the length of the substring that includes the 0 and all preceding 1s.
   - The cost for each 1 that appears before a 0 can be thought of as the number of 0s that need to be moved to the left of this 1.

### Program Analysis:

Let's break down the provided program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)
```

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( n \) and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the binary string and converts it into a list of integers (0s and 1s).

2. **Counting Zeroes**:
   - It counts the total number of 0s in the string using `zeroes = s.count(0)`.

3. **Counters and Cost Calculation**:
   - `cnt` is a list that keeps track of the count of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - `ans` is the variable that accumulates the total cost.
   - The program iterates through the string:
     - For each 0 encountered, if there are any 1s before it (`cnt[1] > 0`), it adds 1 to the cost (`ans += 1`).
     - For each 1 encountered, it adds the number of 0s that have not been encountered yet (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to the cost.

### Correctness Analysis:

The program's logic for cost calculation is flawed. The cost should be the length of the substring that includes the 0 and all preceding 1s, which is not correctly captured by the provided logic. Specifically, the cost for each 0 encountered after a 1 should be the number of 1s seen so far, not just 1. Similarly, the cost for each 1 encountered before a 0 should be the number of 0s that have not been encountered yet, which is correctly captured but not in the context of the correct formula for cyclic shift cost.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string according to the problem's requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
