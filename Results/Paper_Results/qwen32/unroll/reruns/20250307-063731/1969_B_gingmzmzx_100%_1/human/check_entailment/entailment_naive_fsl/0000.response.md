Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using the described cyclic shift operation. The program seems to be attempting to count the number of inversions in the string, which is not directly related to the cost of cyclic shifts as described in the problem statement.

Let's analyze the given example and the program's output:

**Example Input:**
```
5
10
0000
11000
101011
01101001
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
0
9
5
11
```

**Program Output:**
Let's see what the program outputs for the given input.

For the first test case `s = "10"`:
- The program counts the number of inversions, which is 1. However, the correct minimum cost is 2, as we need to perform a cyclic shift on the entire string.

For the second test case `s = "0000"`:
- The program correctly outputs 0, as the string is already sorted.

For the third test case `s = "11000"`:
- The program outputs 3, which is incorrect. The correct minimum cost is 9, as explained in the problem statement.

For the fourth test case `s = "101011"`:
- The program outputs 3, which is incorrect. The correct minimum cost is 5.

For the fifth test case `s = "01101001"`:
- The program outputs 4, which is incorrect. The correct minimum cost is 11.

The program does not handle the cyclic shift cost calculation correctly. It seems to be counting the number of inversions, which is not the same as calculating the minimum cost of cyclic shifts required to sort the string.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and Correctness is **False**.
