### Reasoning:

The provided Python program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. Here's a detailed breakdown of how each function works and whether they collectively solve the problem as described:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: To count the number of valid pairs `(x, y)` for a given `n` and `m` that satisfy the conditions:
     - \(1 \leq x \leq n\)
     - \(1 \leq y \leq m\)
     - \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)
     - \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\)
     - \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\)
     - \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\)
   - **Implementation Details**:
     - The function iterates over possible values of `x` starting from 1 up to the square root of `n`.
     - For each `x`, it iterates over possible values of `y` starting from 1.
     - It checks if the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1.
     - It then checks the conditions \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
     - If both conditions are satisfied, it calculates the number of valid pairs by taking the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` and adds this to the count.
     - Finally, it prints the count of valid pairs.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: To handle multiple test cases.
   - **Implementation Details**:
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to compute and print the number of valid pairs for the given `n` and `m`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of `func_1`**:
  - The function correctly implements the logic to count valid pairs `(x, y)` for a single test case.
  - It ensures that the pairs satisfy all the given conditions.
  - The use of GCD and the conditions \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\) ensures that only valid pairs are counted.
  - The function prints the count of valid pairs, which is the expected output for each test case.

- **Correctness of `func_2`**:
  - The function correctly handles multiple test cases.
  - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to compute and print the result.
  - This ensures that the program can process up to \(10^4\) test cases as specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Both functions together correctly implement the solution to the problem. They handle multiple test cases and correctly count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions.

**Correctness: True**
