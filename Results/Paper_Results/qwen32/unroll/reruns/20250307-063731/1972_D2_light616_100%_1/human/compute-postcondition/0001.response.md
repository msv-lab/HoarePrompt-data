The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Given the state before the loop starts, `t` is already defined as an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `t` is within this range. Since the loop variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be initialized before the loop starts, we don't need to make any adjustments to it.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
