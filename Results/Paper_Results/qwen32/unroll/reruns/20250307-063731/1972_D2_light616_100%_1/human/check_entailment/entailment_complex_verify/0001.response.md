### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and the provided program to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: Handles a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: Handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()`.

Let's delve into `func_1()`:

```python
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)
```

### Key Observations:

1. **Loop Conditions**:
    - The outer loop runs while \(x \cdot x \leq n\), meaning \(x\) ranges from 1 to \(\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\).
    - The inner loop runs while \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) * y \leq m\), where \(y\) starts from 1 and increments.

2. **Condition Check**:
    - The condition `if math.gcd(x, y) == 1` checks if \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime.
    - If \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, the program increments the count by `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.

3. **Logic Analysis**:
    - The logic is based on the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = b\) when \(a\) and \(b\) are coprime. The condition simplifies to checking if \(b\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
    - The program counts the number of valid \(a\) and \(b\) pairs by iterating through possible values and checking the conditions.

### Evaluation of the Program:

1. **Loop Conditions**:
    - The loop conditions \((x + y) * x \leq n\) and \((x + y) * y \leq m\) are restrictive. They limit the search space to pairs where both \((x + y) * x\) and \((x + y) * y\) are within the bounds of \(n\) and \(m\), respectively. This is too narrow and does not cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\).

2. **Counting Logic**:
    - The counting logic `cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is flawed. It assumes that all pairs \((x, y)\) within the restricted loop conditions are valid and counts them based on the minimum number of multiples of \(a + b\) within the bounds. This does not correctly account for all valid pairs \((a, b)\).

### Correctness of the Program:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The loop conditions and counting logic are incorrect and do not cover all valid pairs \((a, b)\).

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic and loop conditions are incorrect, and the counting mechanism does not properly account for all valid pairs \((a, b)\).

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

### Final: **False**
