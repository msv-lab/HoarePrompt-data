### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to see if the program correctly implements the solution.

The problem requires us to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

The given code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function handles a single test case. It reads the values of \(n\) and \(m\), and then iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) to count the valid pairs.
2. `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case.

Let's analyze `func_1()` in detail:
- The outer loop iterates over possible values of \(x\) starting from 1 until \(x^2 > n\).
- The inner loop iterates over possible values of \(y\) starting from 1 until \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
- If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it counts the number of valid pairs by adding the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\) to the count.

However, the logic in `func_1()` does not seem to correctly implement the problem's requirement. The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) is not directly checked. Instead, the code counts pairs based on the GCD being 1 and some other conditions. This does not guarantee that the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\) is satisfied for all counted pairs.

Given the problem's complexity and the provided code, it seems that the logic in `func_1()` is flawed and does not correctly solve the problem as described.
