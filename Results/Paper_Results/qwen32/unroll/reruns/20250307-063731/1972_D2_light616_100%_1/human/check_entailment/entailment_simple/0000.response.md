### Reasoning:

The given program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. The main function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and then calls `func_1` for each test case. The function `func_1` is responsible for calculating the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for given `n` and `m` according to the problem statement.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, `func_1` reads `n` and `m`.

2. **Counting Valid Pairs:**
   - In `func_1`, the program initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
   - It then iterates over possible values of `x` such that `x * x <= n`.
   - For each `x`, it iterates over possible values of `y` starting from 1.
   - The condition `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` ensures that both `a` and `b` (where `a = x * k` and `b = y * k` for some integer `k`) are within the bounds of `n` and `m`.
   - If `gcd(x, y) == 1`, it means `x` and `y` are coprime.
   - The program then increments `cnt` by the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that can be formed with `x` and `y` as the base, which is calculated as `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.

3. **Output:**
   - After counting all valid pairs for a given `n` and `m`, the program prints the count.

### Analysis:

The logic in the program seems correct in terms of the approach to count the valid pairs `(a, b)`. The constraints are handled efficiently by iterating only up to the square root of `n` and using the properties of coprime numbers and gcd.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
