Let's analyze the provided program and check if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

The problem description requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the following conditions:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\)
2. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function appears to calculate the number of valid pairs for a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

Let's analyze `func_1()` in detail. The function uses nested loops to iterate over possible values of `x` and `y` and checks if the pairs (x, y) satisfy the given conditions. The key part of the function is:
```python
while x * x <= n:
    y = 1
    while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
        if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
            cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
        y += 1
    x += 1
```
This loop iterates over possible values of `x` and `y` and checks if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` is 1. If it is, it increments the count by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.

However, there is a critical issue with the logic in `func_1()`. The loop conditions and the way the count is incremented do not correctly account for all valid pairs (a, b). Specifically, the program does not correctly handle all possible pairs (a, b) that satisfy the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

Let's consider a simple test case to illustrate the issue:
Input:
```
1
2 3
```
The correct output for this input is 1, corresponding to the pair (2, 3). However, the provided program will not correctly identify this pair because the logic for counting valid pairs is flawed.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) and check if they satisfy the given condition. Here's a corrected version of the program:
```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (b * math.gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

# func_2()  # Uncomment to run the function
```
This corrected version iterates over all possible pairs (a, b) and checks if they satisfy the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\). This ensures that all valid pairs are counted correctly.

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is therefore incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
