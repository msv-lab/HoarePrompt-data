Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `n` and `m` (where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6). It calculates and prints the total count of valid `(x, y)` pairs such that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` is 1, and the pairs satisfy the conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the count. **
