Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

### Program Analysis

The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function calculates the number of valid pairs for a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

Let's examine `func_1()` in detail:

```python
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)
```

### Key Observations

1. **Loop Conditions**:
    - The outer loop runs while \(x \cdot x \leq n\), which means \(x\) ranges from 1 to \(\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\).
    - The inner loop runs while \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\), where \(y\) starts from 1 and increments.

2. **Condition Check**:
    - The condition `if math.gcd(x, y) == 1` checks if \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime.
    - If \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, the program increments the count by `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.

3. **Logic Analysis**:
    - The logic is based on the fact that if \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, then \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = b\) and the condition simplifies to checking if \(b\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
    - The program counts the number of valid \(a\) and \(b\) pairs by iterating through possible values and checking the conditions.

### Correctness of the Program

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Loop Conditions**:
    - The loop conditions \((x + y) * x \leq n\) and \((x + y) * y \leq m\) are not sufficient to cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\). The program misses many valid pairs because it restricts the search space too narrowly.

2. **Incorrect Counting Logic**:
    - The counting logic `cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is incorrect. It does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic and loop conditions are incorrect, and the counting mechanism does not properly account for all valid pairs \((a, b)\).

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
