You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it performs some computation or comparison involving two positive integers `n` and `m` such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and check if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

The problem description requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the following conditions:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\)
2. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function appears to calculate the number of valid pairs for a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

Let's analyze `func_1()` in detail. The function uses nested loops to iterate over possible values of `x` and `y` and checks if the pairs (x, y) satisfy the given conditions. The key part of the function is:
```python
while x * x <= n:
    y = 1
    while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
        if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
            cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
        y += 1
    x += 1
```
This loop iterates over possible values of `x` and `y` and checks if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` is 1. If it is, it increments the count by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.

However, there is a critical issue with the logic in `func_1()`. The loop conditions and the way the count is incremented do not correctly account for all valid pairs (a, b). Specifically, the program does not correctly handle all possible pairs (a, b) that satisfy the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

Let's consider a simple test case to illustrate the issue:
Input:
```
1
2 3
```
The correct output for this input is 1, corresponding to the pair (2, 3). However, the provided program will not correctly identify this pair because the logic for counting valid pairs is flawed.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) and check if they satisfy the given condition. Here's a corrected version of the program:
```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (b * math.gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

# func_2()  # Uncomment to run the function
```
This corrected version iterates over all possible pairs (a, b) and checks if they satisfy the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\). This ensures that all valid pairs are counted correctly.

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is therefore incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
