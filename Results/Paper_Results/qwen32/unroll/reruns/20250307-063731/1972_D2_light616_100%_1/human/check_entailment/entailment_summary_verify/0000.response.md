The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program (`func_1` and `func_2`) does not correctly compute the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. Specifically, the original assessment points out that the logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not account for all valid pairs.

Let's break down the reasoning and verify it:

1. **Problem Description Recap**:
   - We need to find pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - `func_1` is designed to handle a single test case by iterating over possible values of `x` and `y` and checking if their gcd is 1, then incrementing the count based on a specific formula.
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

3. **Flaw in `func_1`**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is incorrect because it does not properly iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
   - The nested loops in `func_1` do not cover all pairs and the condition check is not correctly implemented.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - A correct approach involves iterating over all pairs \((a, b)\) and directly checking the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

The original assessment provides a corrected version of the program that correctly iterates over all pairs and checks the condition, which is the correct way to solve the problem.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is accurate in identifying that the provided program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
