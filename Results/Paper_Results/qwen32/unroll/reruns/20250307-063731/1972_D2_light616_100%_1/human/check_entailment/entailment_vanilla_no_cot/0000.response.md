Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program is designed to iterate over possible pairs (x, y) and check if their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 1, then it counts the number of valid pairs (a, b) based on that. However, this approach does not correctly address the condition that `b * gcd(a, b)` must be a multiple of `a + b`.

The condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` needs to be checked for each pair (a, b) directly, rather than inferring it from the gcd of (x, y) being 1. The given implementation does not ensure that all valid pairs (a, b) are counted and may miss some valid pairs or incorrectly count others.

Here's a brief outline of a correct approach:
- For each test case, iterate over all possible values of `a` from 1 to `n` and `b` from 1 to `m`.
- For each pair `(a, b)`, check if `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0`.
- Count the number of pairs that satisfy the condition.

The provided program does not implement this logic correctly, hence it is incorrect.
