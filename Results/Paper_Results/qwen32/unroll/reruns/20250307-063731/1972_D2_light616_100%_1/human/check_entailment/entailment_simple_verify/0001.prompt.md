You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

### Program Analysis

The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function calculates the number of valid pairs for a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

Let's examine `func_1()` in detail:

```python
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)
```

### Key Observations

1. **Loop Conditions**:
    - The outer loop runs while \(x \cdot x \leq n\), which means \(x\) ranges from 1 to \(\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\).
    - The inner loop runs while \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\), where \(y\) starts from 1 and increments.

2. **Condition Check**:
    - The condition `if math.gcd(x, y) == 1` checks if \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime.
    - If \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, the program increments the count by `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.

3. **Logic Analysis**:
    - The logic is based on the fact that if \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, then \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = b\) and the condition simplifies to checking if \(b\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
    - The program counts the number of valid \(a\) and \(b\) pairs by iterating through possible values and checking the conditions.

### Correctness of the Program

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Loop Conditions**:
    - The loop conditions \((x + y) * x \leq n\) and \((x + y) * y \leq m\) are not sufficient to cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\). The program misses many valid pairs because it restricts the search space too narrowly.

2. **Incorrect Counting Logic**:
    - The counting logic `cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is incorrect. It does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic and loop conditions are incorrect, and the counting mechanism does not properly account for all valid pairs \((a, b)\).

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
