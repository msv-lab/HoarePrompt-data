To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to analyze the given code snippet:

```python
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()
```

Here, `t` is the input integer, and `func_1()` is a function that is called `t` times in a loop. The loop variable `_` is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use within the loop.

Since we are not given the definition of `func_1()`, we cannot determine the exact effects of the loop on any variables that `func_1()` might modify. However, we can determine the state of the loop variable `_` and the loop itself.

The loop variable `_` is a temporary variable that takes on the values from 0 to `t-1` during each iteration of the loop. After the loop completes, `_` is no longer in scope and does not retain any value.

The variable `t` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the loop since it is used only to control the number of iterations and is not modified within the loop.

Thus, the output state after the loop has finished executing is:

Output State: **`t` remains the input integer, and the loop variable `_` is no longer in scope.**
