### Reasoning

Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem description, the provided program, and the function summaries to determine the correctness of the program.

**Problem Description Recap:**
- We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
  - \(1 \le a \le n\)
  - \(1 \le b \le m\)
  - \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

**Program Analysis:**
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function calculates the number of valid pairs for a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

Let's examine `func_1()` in detail:

```python
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)
```

### Key Observations and Issues

1. **Loop Conditions**:
   - The outer loop runs while \(x \cdot x \leq n\), which means \(x\) ranges from 1 to \(\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\).
   - The inner loop runs while \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) * y \leq m\), where \(y\) starts from 1 and increments.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `if math.gcd(x, y) == 1` checks if \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime.
   - If \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, the program increments the count by `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The logic is flawed because it restricts the search space too narrowly. The condition \((x + y) * x \leq n\) and \((x + y) * y \leq m\) does not cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\).
   - The counting mechanism `cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is incorrect. It assumes that all multiples of \((x + y) * x\) and \((x + y) * y\) within the bounds are valid, which is not the case.

### Correctness of the Program

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Loop Conditions**:
   - The loop conditions \((x + y) * x \leq n\) and \((x + y) * y \leq m\) are not sufficient to cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\). The program misses many valid pairs because it restricts the search space too narrowly.

2. **Incorrect Counting Logic**:
   - The counting logic `cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is incorrect. It does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.

### Function Summary Analysis

The function summary for `func_2()` is correct in that it describes the function's role in processing multiple test cases. However, it does not provide insight into the correctness of the logic within `func_1()`.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic and loop conditions are incorrect, and the counting mechanism does not properly account for all valid pairs \((a, b)\).

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Final: False**
