To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the given initial state and the variables involved:

- `n` remains `n`: This means `n` is some integer value, but its specific value is not provided.
- `m` remains `m`: Similarly, `m` is some integer value, and its specific value is not provided.
- `x` is the smallest integer such that `x * x > n`: This means `x` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`.
- `cnt` is the total count of valid `(x, y)` pairs: This implies that `cnt` is the count of pairs `(x, y)` that satisfy some condition, but the specific condition is not provided in the initial state. However, based on the context, we can infer that it likely involves the values of `x` and `y` relative to `n` and `m`.

Given that the specific values of `n`, `m`, and the condition for the valid `(x, y)` pairs are not provided, we can only describe `cnt` in terms of the given conditions.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the total count of valid (x, y) pairs such that x is the smallest integer greater than the square root of n and the pairs satisfy some condition relative to n and m)**
