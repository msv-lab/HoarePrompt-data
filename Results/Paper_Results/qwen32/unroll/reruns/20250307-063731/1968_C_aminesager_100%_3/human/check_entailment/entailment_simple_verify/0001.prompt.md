You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve the problem by constructing an array `a` from the given array `x`. However, the logic in the program does not correctly ensure that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `2 <= i <= n`.

Let's break down the program and see why it is incorrect:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `x` (which is `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n`).
3. It initializes the array `a` with a single element of `1000`.
4. It then constructs the rest of the array `a` by adding the previous element of `a` to the corresponding element of `x`. Specifically, `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.

This approach does not guarantee that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `2 <= i <= n`. The constructed array `a` is simply the cumulative sum of the elements of `x` starting from `1000`, which does not satisfy the modulo condition as required by the problem.

For example, consider the first test case from the problem statement:
- Input: `n = 4`, `x = [2, 4, 1]`
- The program constructs `a` as `[1000, 1002, 1006, 1007]`.
- Checking the modulo conditions:
  - `1002 % 1000 = 2` (correct)
  - `1006 % 1002 = 4` (correct)
  - `1007 % 1006 = 1` (correct)

While this specific test case happens to work, it is not guaranteed that this approach will work for all inputs. The program needs to ensure that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `2 <= i <= n`, which the current logic does not guarantee.

A correct approach would be to initialize `a_1` to any value greater than the maximum value in `x` (to ensure `a_1 > x_i` for all `i`), and then set `a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i` for all `2 <= i <= n`. This ensures that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` because `x_i` is the remainder when `a_i` is divided by `a_{i-1}`.

Correctness: **False**
