Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of elements in an array `a`, and `n-1` integers `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n` representing the elements of an array `x`. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the provided inputs.**
