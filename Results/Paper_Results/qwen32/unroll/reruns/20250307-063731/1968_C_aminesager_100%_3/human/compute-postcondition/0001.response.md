In the given task, the `while` loop condition is `while t:`. In Python, a non-zero integer is considered `True` in a boolean context, and zero is considered `False`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be a non-zero integer.

Given the state right before the `while` loop is `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, we need to ensure that `t` is not zero for the loop to execute at least once.

**Answer:**
State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and `t` must be greater than 0**
