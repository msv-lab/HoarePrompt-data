t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is an integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and the second element is a list of integers x of length n-1 where each x_i satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
