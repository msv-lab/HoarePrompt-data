You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input('')
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [1000]
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it constructs an array `a` where each element `a[i]` (for i > 0) is the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i]` from the input array `x`. The function then outputs the constructed array `a` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not correctly generate an array `a` that satisfies the conditions specified in the problem description. Let's analyze why:

The program initializes `a` with a single element `[1000]` and then iteratively appends elements to `a` by adding the corresponding element from `T` (which represents `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n`) to the previous element in `a`. 

However, this approach does not guarantee that `a_i % a_{i-1} == x_i` for all `i >= 2`. Specifically, the condition `a_i % a_{i-1} == x_i` is not being satisfied by the current implementation. Let's consider a simple counterexample:

#### Counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
An array `a` such that:
- `a_2 % a_1 == 1`
- `a_3 % a_2 == 1`

For example, `a = [2, 3, 4]` is a valid output because:
- `3 % 2 == 1`
- `4 % 3 == 1`

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
1000 1001 1002
```

This output does not satisfy the conditions:
- `1001 % 1000 == 1` (This is correct, but let's check the next condition)
- `1002 % 1001 == 1` (This is incorrect, as `1002 % 1001 == 1` is true, but the logic is flawed for other inputs)

However, let's consider another input to show the flaw more clearly:

**Input:**
```
1
3
2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
An array `a` such that:
- `a_2 % a_1 == 2`
- `a_3 % a_2 == 2`

For example, `a = [3, 5, 7]` is a valid output because:
- `5 % 3 == 2`
- `7 % 5 == 2`

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
1000 1002 1004
```

This output does not satisfy the conditions:
- `1002 % 1000 == 2` (This is correct, but let's check the next condition)
- `1004 % 1002 == 2` (This is incorrect, as `1004 % 1002 == 2` is true, but the logic is flawed for other inputs)

The program's logic does not ensure that `a_i % a_{i-1} == x_i` for all `i >= 2` in a general case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, one possible approach is to set `a_1` to any value greater than `x_1` (since `a_1` can be any value between 1 and \(10^9\)). Then, for each subsequent `a_i`, set `a_i` to `a_{i-1} + x_i`. This ensures that `a_i % a_{i-1} == x_i` because `a_i` is constructed such that the remainder when `a_i` is divided by `a_{i-1}` is exactly `x_i`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input('')
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [T[0] + 1]  # a_1 can be any value greater than x_1
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i])
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the conditions are met for all test cases.
