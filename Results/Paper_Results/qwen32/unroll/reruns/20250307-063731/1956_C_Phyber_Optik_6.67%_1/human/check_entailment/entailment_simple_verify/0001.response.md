### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotations to determine if the program correctly maximizes the sum of the matrix within the constraints.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to maximize the sum of an `n x n` matrix using Type 1 and Type 2 operations.
- Type 1: Assign a permutation to a row.
- Type 2: Assign a permutation to a column.
- The maximum sum possible is `n * n * (n + 1) / 2` because each cell can hold a value from 1 to `n`.

#### Analysis of the Provided Program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the size of each matrix `n`.

2. **Calculating the Maximum Sum:**
   - The program calculates the maximum sum as `n * n * (n + 1) // 2`, which is correct. This is the sum of all elements if each cell in the matrix is filled with the largest possible values (1 to `n`).

3. **Determining the Number of Operations:**
   - The program calculates `r` based on the condition `if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. This logic seems flawed because it doesn't directly relate to the number of operations needed to fill the matrix.
   - The program then prints `n + r` as the number of operations. This is incorrect because we need exactly `2n` operations to fill the matrix optimally (n Type 1 and n Type 2 operations).

4. **Generating Operations:**
   - The program generates `n + r` operations. For the first `n` operations, it performs Type 1 operations on each row. This part is correct if `r` were 0.
   - For the remaining `r` operations, it performs Type 2 operations on columns, but the logic for `r` is incorrect.

#### Correctness Evaluation:

- **Sum Calculation:**
  - The sum calculation `n * n * (n + 1) // 2` is correct.

- **Number of Operations:**
  - The program should output exactly `2n` operations. The current logic for `r` is incorrect and leads to an incorrect number of operations.

- **Operation Generation:**
  - The program should perform `n` Type 1 operations to fill all rows and `n` Type 2 operations to fill all columns. The current logic for generating these operations is flawed due to the incorrect calculation of `r`.

#### Corrected Program:

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * n * (n + 1) // 2  # Total sum of all elements in the matrix
        print(max_sum, 2 * n)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(2, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect due to the incorrect logic for determining the number of operations and the way operations are generated. The corrected version ensures that exactly `2n` operations are performed, which is optimal for filling the matrix with the largest possible values.

**Final: False**
