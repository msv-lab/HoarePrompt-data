The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the size of an n Ã— n matrix. For each test case, it calculates a sum based on specific conditions and prints this sum followed by `n + r` lines. Each line either starts with `1` or `2` and is followed by the numbers from `1` to `n`.
