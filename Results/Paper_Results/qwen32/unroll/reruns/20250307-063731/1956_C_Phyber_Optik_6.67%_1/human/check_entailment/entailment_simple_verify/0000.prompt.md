You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum sum of the matrix and the operations required to achieve that sum. Let's analyze why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of the Sum**:
   The sum is calculated using the formula `n * (n + 1) // 2` and `i * n`, which does not correctly reflect the maximum possible sum of the matrix. The maximum sum can be achieved by filling the matrix with the largest possible distinct values, which are the integers from 1 to n.

2. **Incorrect Number of Operations**:
   The program calculates the number of operations as `n + r`, where `r` is derived from the sum calculation, which is not aligned with the problem description. The problem states that the maximum sum can always be obtained in no more than `2n` operations, and the operations should be described correctly.

3. **Incorrect Operations Description**:
   The operations described in the program do not ensure that the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values. For example, the program uses a permutation of `range(1, n + 1)` for each row and column, but it does not guarantee that the sum is maximized. 

To correct the program, the following approach should be taken:
- For each row `i` from 1 to `n`, perform a Type 1 operation to set the row to the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
- For each column `i` from 1 to `n`, perform a Type 2 operation to set the column to the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

This ensures that each element in the matrix is set to the maximum possible value, resulting in the maximum sum of `n^2 * (n + 1) / 2`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * n * (n + 1) // 2
        operations = []
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            operations.append((1, i, list(range(1, n + 1))))
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            operations.append((2, i, list(range(1, n + 1))))
        print(max_sum, 2 * n)
        for op in operations:
            print(*op)

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the maximum sum is achieved and the operations are correctly described.
