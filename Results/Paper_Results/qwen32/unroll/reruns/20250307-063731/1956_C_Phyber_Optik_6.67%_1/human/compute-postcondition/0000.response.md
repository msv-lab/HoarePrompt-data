The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The other variables mentioned (including the matrix `a` and its size `n`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 500) representing the size of the `n` × `n` matrix `a`. It is guaranteed that the sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5. `t` is assigned the value of the first integer input.**
