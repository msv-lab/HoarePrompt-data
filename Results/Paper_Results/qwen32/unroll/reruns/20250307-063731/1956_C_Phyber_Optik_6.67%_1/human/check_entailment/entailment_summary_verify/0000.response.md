Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary in detail to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Matrix Filling Strategy**:
   - The problem requires filling an n x n matrix such that the sum of all elements is maximized.
   - The maximum sum can be achieved by ensuring each element in the matrix is set to the maximum possible value, which is `n` in this context.
   - The optimal strategy is to fill each row (using Type 1 operations) and each column (using Type 2 operations) with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The maximum possible sum of the matrix is `n^2 * (n + 1) / 2`. This is because each element in the matrix will be the average of the numbers from 1 to n, but since we are using permutations, each number from 1 to n will appear exactly n times in the matrix.

3. **Operations**:
   - The number of operations should be no more than `2n`. Since we need to fill each row and each column, this can be done in exactly `2n` operations (n Type 1 operations and n Type 2 operations).

### Program Analysis:
- The provided program attempts to calculate the sum and operations but does so incorrectly.
- The sum calculation in the program is flawed. It uses a conditional sum calculation that does not align with the problem's requirement to maximize the sum.
- The operations described in the program do not ensure that the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values. The program uses a permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` for each row and column, but the sum calculation is incorrect.

### Corrected Program:
The corrected program should:
- Calculate the maximum sum as `n^2 * (n + 1) / 2`.
- Perform `n` Type 1 operations to fill each row with `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
- Perform `n` Type 2 operations to fill each column with `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * n * (n + 1) // 2
        operations = []
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            operations.append((1, i, list(range(1, n + 1))))
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            operations.append((2, i, list(range(1, n + 1))))
        print(max_sum, 2 * n)
        for op in operations:
            print(*op)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the maximum sum and does not ensure that the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values using the correct number of operations. The provided function summary does not accurately reflect the program's behavior, and the original assessment is correct.

**Final: False**
