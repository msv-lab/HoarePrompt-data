Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Sum Calculation**: The sum calculation in the code is incorrect. The maximum possible sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling the matrix with the highest possible values using the allowed operations. For an `n x n` matrix, the optimal strategy is to fill the matrix with the numbers from 1 to n in a way that each number appears exactly `n` times. The maximum sum is thus `n * (n * (n + 1) / 2)`, which is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, each repeated `n` times.

2. **Operation Description**: The operations described in the output are also incorrect. The program should perform operations that fill the matrix in an optimal way. The correct way to achieve the maximum sum is to use type 1 operations to fill each row with the numbers from 1 to n, and then use type 2 operations to fill each column with the numbers from 1 to n. However, the program does not correctly implement this logic.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)
        operations = []
        
        # Fill each row with 1 to n
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            operations.append((1, i, list(range(1, n + 1))))
        
        # Fill each column with 1 to n
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            operations.append((2, i, list(range(1, n + 1))))
        
        print(max_sum, len(operations))
        for op in operations:
            print(op[0], op[1], *op[2])

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the maximum sum is achieved and that the operations are correctly described. Each row and each column is filled with the numbers from 1 to n, ensuring that the sum of the matrix is maximized.
