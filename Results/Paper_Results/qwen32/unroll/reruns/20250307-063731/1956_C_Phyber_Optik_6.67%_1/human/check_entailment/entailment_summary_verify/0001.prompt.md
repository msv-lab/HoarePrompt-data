You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

        n = int(input())
        (sum, r) = (0, 0)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n:
                r = i
                sum += n * (n + 1) // 2
            else:
                sum += i * n
        print(sum, n + r)
        for j in range(1, n + r + 1):

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the size of an n × n matrix. For each test case, it calculates a sum based on specific conditions and prints this sum followed by `n + r` lines. Each line either starts with `1` or `2` and is followed by the numbers from `1` to `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
- We have an `n x n` matrix filled with zeroes.
- We can perform two types of operations:
  - Type 1: Assign a permutation to a row.
  - Type 2: Assign a permutation to a column.
- Goal: Maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix with no more than `2n` operations.

### Key Observations:
- The maximum value that can be placed in any cell is `n`.
- To maximize the sum, we should try to place larger numbers in as many cells as possible.
- Using permutations, we can fill rows and columns with values from `1` to `n`.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Calculating the Maximum Sum:**
   - The program calculates the maximum sum by considering the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
   - It then calculates the sum of the matrix by placing the largest possible values in the matrix, ensuring that each row and column is filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - The sum is calculated as `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each row, which is correct.

3. **Determining the Number of Operations:**
   - The program sets the number of operations to `n + r`, where `r` is calculated based on some condition.
   - However, the logic for calculating `r` seems incorrect. The program should simply perform `n` Type 1 operations to fill all rows with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`, and then perform `n` Type 2 operations to fill all columns with the same permutation. This will ensure that the matrix is filled with the largest possible values, and it will use exactly `2n` operations.

4. **Generating Operations:**
   - The program generates `n + r` operations.
   - For the first `n` operations, it performs Type 1 operations on each row.
   - For the remaining `r` operations, it performs Type 2 operations on columns, but the logic for determining `r` and the way columns are filled seems incorrect.

### Correctness:
- The program's logic for calculating the maximum sum is correct.
- However, the logic for determining the number of operations and the way operations are generated is incorrect. The program should simply perform `n` Type 1 operations and `n` Type 2 operations, which will fill the matrix with the largest possible values and use exactly `2n` operations.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * n * (n + 1) // 2  # Total sum of all elements in the matrix
        print(max_sum, 2 * n)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(2, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the incorrect logic for determining the number of operations and the way operations are generated.

Correctness: **False**
