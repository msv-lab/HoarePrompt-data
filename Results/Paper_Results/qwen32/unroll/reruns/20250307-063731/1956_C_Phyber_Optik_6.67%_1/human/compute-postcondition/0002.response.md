To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand how the code processes each test case. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Outer Loop (`for _ in range(t)`):** This loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. **Inner Loop (`for i in range(1, n + 1)`):** For each test case, this loop iterates from 1 to `n`.
3. **Condition (`if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`):** This condition checks if the sum of the first `n` natural numbers is greater than `i * n`. If true, it sets `r` to `i` and adds the sum of the first `n` natural numbers to `sum`. Otherwise, it adds `i * n` to `sum`.
4. **Printing (`print(sum, n + r)`):** After the inner loop, it prints the `sum` and `n + r`.
5. **Another Loop (`for j in range(1, n + r + 1)`):** This loop prints `n + r` lines. For each line, if `j` is less than or equal to `n`, it prints `1`, `j`, and the numbers from `1` to `n`. If `j` is greater than `n`, it prints `2`, `j % n`, and the numbers from `1` to `n`.

Let's analyze the output for each test case:

- **Sum Calculation:**
  - The sum is calculated based on the condition inside the inner loop. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, it adds `n * (n + 1) // 2` to `sum`. Otherwise, it adds `i * n` to `sum`.
  - For a given `n`, the sum of the first `n` natural numbers is `n * (n + 1) // 2`. This value is added to `sum` for all `i` where the condition is true.

- **Value of `r`:**
  - `r` is set to the last `i` for which the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true.

- **Printing:**
  - After calculating `sum` and `r`, it prints `sum` and `n + r`.
  - Then, it prints `n + r` lines, where each line either starts with `1` or `2` and is followed by the numbers from `1` to `n`.

Given the format of the problem, the output state after all iterations would be a series of outputs for each test case. Since the problem asks for a single output state, we can describe it in terms of the final printed values for each test case.

Let's summarize the output state:

Output State: **For each test case with size `n`, the output consists of the sum calculated based on the described conditions, followed by `n + r` lines where each line either starts with `1` or `2` and is followed by the numbers from `1` to `n`.**

Since the exact values of `sum` and `r` depend on the specific values of `n` in each test case, we cannot provide a single numerical output state. However, the format and the process of generating the output are as described above.

Thus, the final answer in the required format is:

Output State: **For each test case with size `n`, the output consists of the sum calculated based on the described conditions, followed by `n + r` lines where each line either starts with `1` or `2` and is followed by the numbers from `1` to `n`.**
