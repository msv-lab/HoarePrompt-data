Reasoning: 
The program is intended to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of an n x n matrix using a limited number of operations. The described approach involves calculating a sum based on specific conditions and then generating a sequence of operations to achieve this sum.

Let's break down the program's logic and verify its correctness:

1. **Sum Calculation Logic:**
   - The program iterates through each test case and calculates a sum based on the size of the matrix `n`.
   - For each row `i` from 1 to `n`, it checks if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. If true, it sets `r` to `i` and adds `n * (n + 1) // 2` to the sum. Otherwise, it adds `i * n` to the sum.
   - The sum calculation seems to be based on the idea of filling the matrix with the maximum possible values in a way that maximizes the total sum. However, the logic for calculating `r` and the sum itself is not entirely clear from the problem description and might be incorrect as per the provided example.

2. **Operation Generation Logic:**
   - After calculating the sum, the program generates `n + r` operations.
   - For each operation from 1 to `n`, it performs a Type 1 operation (filling a row with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`).
   - For each operation from `n + 1` to `n + r`, it performs a Type 2 operation (filling a column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`).
   - The operations are generated in a way that ensures no more than `2n` operations are used, as required by the problem statement.

3. **Example Verification:**
   - For the first test case with `n = 1`, the program outputs `1 1` and `1 1 1`, which is correct as the maximum sum is 1 and only one operation is needed to fill the single cell with 1.
   - For the second test case with `n = 2`, the program outputs `7 3` and the operations `1 1 1 2`, `1 2 1 2`, `2 1 1 2`. This seems to be incorrect because the maximum sum should be 8 (filling the matrix with `[[2, 1], [1, 2]]`), and the operations do not achieve this.

Given the discrepancy between the expected output and the program's output for the second test case, the sum calculation logic appears to be incorrect. The program does not generate the operations in a way that maximizes the sum for all test cases.

Therefore, the program is not correct based on the provided problem description and example.

Correctness: **False**
