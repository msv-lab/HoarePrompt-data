Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum sum of the matrix and the operations required to achieve that sum. Let's analyze why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of the Sum**:
   The sum is calculated using the formula `n * (n + 1) // 2` and `i * n`, which does not correctly reflect the maximum possible sum of the matrix. The maximum sum can be achieved by filling the matrix with the largest possible distinct values, which are the integers from 1 to n.

2. **Incorrect Number of Operations**:
   The program calculates the number of operations as `n + r`, where `r` is derived from the sum calculation, which is not aligned with the problem description. The problem states that the maximum sum can always be obtained in no more than `2n` operations, and the operations should be described correctly.

3. **Incorrect Operations Description**:
   The operations described in the program do not ensure that the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values. For example, the program uses a permutation of `range(1, n + 1)` for each row and column, but it does not guarantee that the sum is maximized. 

To correct the program, the following approach should be taken:
- For each row `i` from 1 to `n`, perform a Type 1 operation to set the row to the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
- For each column `i` from 1 to `n`, perform a Type 2 operation to set the column to the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

This ensures that each element in the matrix is set to the maximum possible value, resulting in the maximum sum of `n^2 * (n + 1) / 2`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * n * (n + 1) // 2
        operations = []
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            operations.append((1, i, list(range(1, n + 1))))
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            operations.append((2, i, list(range(1, n + 1))))
        print(max_sum, 2 * n)
        for op in operations:
            print(*op)

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the maximum sum is achieved and the operations are correctly described.
