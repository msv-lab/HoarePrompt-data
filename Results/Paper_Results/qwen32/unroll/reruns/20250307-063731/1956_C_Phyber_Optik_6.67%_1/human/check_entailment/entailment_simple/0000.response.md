Reasoning:  
The program provided does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic for calculating the sum and the operations to achieve this sum is flawed. Here are the issues:

1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum is calculated based on a condition that seems to be incorrect. The sum of all elements in the matrix should be maximized, and the maximum sum for an n x n matrix where each row and each column is filled with a permutation of numbers from 1 to n is \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \). This is because each number from 1 to n appears exactly once in each row and each column, and the sum of numbers from 1 to n is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \). Therefore, the total sum should be \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).

2. **Number of Operations:**
   - The number of operations is calculated as `n + r`, where `r` is determined based on the incorrect sum calculation. The correct number of operations should be `2n` because you can fill each row and each column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to n using `n` type 1 operations and `n` type 2 operations.

3. **Operation Details:**
   - The operations are supposed to fill each row and each column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the operations for `r` extra operations.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        # Maximum sum is n * sum of numbers from 1 to n
        max_sum = n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)
        
        # Number of operations is 2n
        num_operations = 2 * n
        
        print(max_sum, num_operations)
        
        # Perform n type 1 operations (fill each row)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
        
        # Perform n type 2 operations (fill each column)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(2, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))

# Call the function to execute the solution
func()
```

Correctness: **False**
