### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description and the expected behavior:

1. **Input Parsing and Looping Through Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the size of the matrix.

2. **Calculating the Sum:**
   - The program initializes `sum` to `0` and `r` to `0`.
   - It then iterates over `i` from `1` to `n`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. If true, it sets `r` to `i` and adds `n * (n + 1) // 2` to `sum`. Otherwise, it simply adds `i * n` to `sum`.
   - This logic seems incorrect because it does not maximize the sum in the way described in the problem. The correct approach to maximize the sum is to fill the matrix with the largest possible distinct numbers in each row and column, which is essentially filling the matrix with the numbers from `1` to `n` in a way that each number appears exactly once in each row and each column.

3. **Determining the Number of Operations:**
   - The program calculates the number of operations as `n + r`.
   - This is also incorrect because the problem states that you can achieve the maximum sum with no more than `2n` operations, and the program's logic does not guarantee this.

4. **Generating Operations:**
   - The program prints `n + r` lines of operations.
   - For each line, if `j` is less than or equal to `n`, it prints `1 j` followed by the numbers from `1` to `n`.
   - If `j` is greater than `n`, it prints `2 (j % n)` followed by the numbers from `1` to `n`.
   - This logic is incorrect because it does not ensure that the matrix is filled optimally to achieve the maximum sum.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for calculating the sum and generating the operations is flawed and does not maximize the sum of the matrix.

**Correctness: False**
