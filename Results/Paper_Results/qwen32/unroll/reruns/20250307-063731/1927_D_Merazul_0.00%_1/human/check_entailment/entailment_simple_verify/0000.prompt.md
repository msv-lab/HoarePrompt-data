You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not seem to correctly address the problem description. Here's why:

The problem requires handling multiple test cases, each with an array and several queries. For each query, the program must find two indices `i` and `j` within the specified range `[l, r]` such that `a[i] ≠ a[j]`. If such indices do not exist, the program should output `-1 -1`.

However, the provided code does not correctly parse the input or implement the required logic. Here are some specific issues:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The code attempts to read input using `R = lambda : map(int, input().split())`, but it incorrectly handles the input structure. For example, it reads the number of test cases `t`, but then it incorrectly reads the rest of the input.

2. **Logic Implementation:**
   - The code seems to be attempting to solve a different problem. It involves sets `a` and `b` and some logic with `f`, `m`, and `n`, which do not correspond to the problem requirements.
   - The code does not iterate over the queries for each test case and does not check for pairs of different elements within the specified range.

3. **Output:**
   - The code outputs `'YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2]`, which is not related to the problem's output requirements of printing two indices or `-1 -1`.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the problem description and will not work correctly for the intended purpose. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
