Reasoning:  
The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem requires finding two different indices within a specified range in an array for each query, such that the elements at these indices are not equal. If no such pair exists, it should output `-1 -1`.

However, the given program does the following:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array, the array itself, and the number of queries.
3. It then reads the queries, but the logic inside the loop is incorrect and does not address the problem requirements. Instead of checking for different elements within the specified range, it seems to be checking the presence of integers in two sets and printing 'YES' or 'NO'.

The program uses sets `a` and `b` which are populated with elements from the input, but it does not process the queries correctly to find the required indices `i` and `j` as per the problem statement. The logic involving `f`, `m`, and `n` does not align with the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
