The code snippet `t, = R()` reads a single integer value from the input using the lambda function `R` and assigns it to the variable `t`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; q is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5; for each query, l and r are integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n; `R` is a lambda function that maps input to a list of integers.**
