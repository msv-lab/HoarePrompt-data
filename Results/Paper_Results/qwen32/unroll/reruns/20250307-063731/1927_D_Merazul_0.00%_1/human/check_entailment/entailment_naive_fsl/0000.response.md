Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not seem to correctly address the problem description. Here's why:

The problem requires handling multiple test cases, each with an array and several queries. For each query, the program must find two indices `i` and `j` within the specified range `[l, r]` such that `a[i] â‰  a[j]`. If such indices do not exist, the program should output `-1 -1`.

However, the provided code does not correctly parse the input or implement the required logic. Here are some specific issues:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The code attempts to read input using `R = lambda : map(int, input().split())`, but it incorrectly handles the input structure. For example, it reads the number of test cases `t`, but then it incorrectly reads the rest of the input.

2. **Logic Implementation:**
   - The code seems to be attempting to solve a different problem. It involves sets `a` and `b` and some logic with `f`, `m`, and `n`, which do not correspond to the problem requirements.
   - The code does not iterate over the queries for each test case and does not check for pairs of different elements within the specified range.

3. **Output:**
   - The code outputs `'YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2]`, which is not related to the problem's output requirements of printing two indices or `-1 -1`.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the problem description and will not work correctly for the intended purpose. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
