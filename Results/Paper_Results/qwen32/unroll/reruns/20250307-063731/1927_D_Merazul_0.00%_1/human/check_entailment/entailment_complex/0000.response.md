Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The problem requires finding two different indices \(i\) and \(j\) within a specified range \([l, r]\) such that the elements at these indices are not equal. If no such pair exists, it should return \(-1 -1\).

However, the provided code does not perform the required operations. Instead, it seems to be checking for the presence of integers in two sets and printing 'YES' or 'NO' based on some logic that is unrelated to the problem statement. Specifically, the code:
- Reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
- It then reads the number of queries and the queries.
- It processes the queries in a way that does not involve checking for different elements within the specified range but instead checks for the presence of integers in two sets.

The correct approach would involve:
- For each query, checking the subarray from index \(l\) to \(r\).
- Determining if there are at least two different elements in this subarray.
- If such elements exist, finding their indices and printing them.
- If no such elements exist, printing \(-1 -1\).

Given the mismatch between the provided code and the problem requirements, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
