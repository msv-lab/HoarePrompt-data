You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires finding two different indices `i` and `j` within a given range `[l, r]` of an array `a` such that `a[i] != a[j]`. If such indices do not exist, we need to output `-1 -1`.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program does not seem to correctly address the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the program does:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the array `a`, the number of queries `q`, and the queries themselves.

2. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query, it attempts to determine if there are two different elements within the range `[l, r]`.
   - The program uses sets `a` and `b` to store some values, but it doesn't correctly map these sets to the array elements within the range `[l, r]`.
   - The program uses bitwise operations to check for the presence of elements, but the logic does not correctly correspond to the problem requirements.

3. **Output:**
   - The output is not correctly formatted to match the problem's requirements. The program outputs a single character ('Y', 'N', or 'E') based on some condition, which is not the expected format of two indices or `-1 -1`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. For each query, extract the subarray `a[l:r+1]`.
2. Check if there are at least two distinct elements in this subarray.
3. If there are, output the indices of these two distinct elements.
4. If there are not, output `-1 -1`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic and the output format do not match the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
