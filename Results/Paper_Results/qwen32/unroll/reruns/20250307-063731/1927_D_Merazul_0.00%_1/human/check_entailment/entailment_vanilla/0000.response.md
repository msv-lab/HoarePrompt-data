Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires finding two different indices `i` and `j` within a given range `[l, r]` of an array `a` such that `a[i] != a[j]`. If such indices do not exist, we need to output `-1 -1`.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program does not seem to correctly address the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the program does:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the array `a`, the number of queries `q`, and the queries themselves.

2. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query, it attempts to determine if there are two different elements within the range `[l, r]`.
   - The program uses sets `a` and `b` to store some values, but it doesn't correctly map these sets to the array elements within the range `[l, r]`.
   - The program uses bitwise operations to check for the presence of elements, but the logic does not correctly correspond to the problem requirements.

3. **Output:**
   - The output is not correctly formatted to match the problem's requirements. The program outputs a single character ('Y', 'N', or 'E') based on some condition, which is not the expected format of two indices or `-1 -1`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. For each query, extract the subarray `a[l:r+1]`.
2. Check if there are at least two distinct elements in this subarray.
3. If there are, output the indices of these two distinct elements.
4. If there are not, output `-1 -1`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic and the output format do not match the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
