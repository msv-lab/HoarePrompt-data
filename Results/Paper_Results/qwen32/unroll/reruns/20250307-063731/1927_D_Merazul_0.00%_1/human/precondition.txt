t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case and contains three elements: an integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, a list a of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and a list of q queries where each query is a tuple (l, r) such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, and q satisfies 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
