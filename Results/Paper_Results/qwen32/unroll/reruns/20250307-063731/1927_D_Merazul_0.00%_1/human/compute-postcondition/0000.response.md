The provided code snippet defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer. However, the code does not actually execute the lambda function or use its output. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged, and no new variables are introduced or modified.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; q is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5; for each query, l and r are integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n; `R` is a lambda function that maps input to a list of integers.**
