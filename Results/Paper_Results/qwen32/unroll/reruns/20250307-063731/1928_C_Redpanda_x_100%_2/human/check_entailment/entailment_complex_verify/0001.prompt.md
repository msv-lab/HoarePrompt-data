You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

    if (nn > 1) :
        factors[nn] = factors.get(nn, 0) + 1
    #State: `n` remains unchanged; `factors` contains the prime factors of `n` and their counts, with `factors[nn]` incremented by 1 if `nn` is greater than 1; `nn` is either 1 or a prime number greater than the square root of `n`; `i` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n` or the next integer after the largest prime factor found.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` greater than 1 and yields its prime factors. The prime factors are generated and yielded one by one, without modifying the original input `n`.

    #State: `k` is a non-negative integer, `n` and `x` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, and `primes` is a list of integers. If `k` equals the length of the list `primes`, the value `1` is yielded. Otherwise, a sequence of values is generated by the loop, where each value is of the form `factor * prime^i` for `factor` in `rest` and `i` ranging from `0` to `factors[prime]`. The variables `k`, `n`, `x`, `primes`, and `rest` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `generate` is a generator that yields a sequence of values based on a list of primes and their respective factors. It recursively generates combinations of these primes raised to different powers and multiplied by previously generated factors. The final state of the program after it concludes is that it has yielded all possible combinations of the form `factor * prime^i` for each prime in the list and for `i` ranging from `0` to the power specified in the `factors` dictionary. The variables `k`, `n`, `x`, `primes`, and `rest` remain unchanged throughout the execution.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:
The provided program does not solve the given problem correctly. The task is to determine the number of possible values of \( k \) such that Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received \( x \) fit the described settling pattern.

The provided code consists of two functions, `func_1` and `generate`, which appear to be intended to generate factors of a number. However, the code does not directly address the problem of finding valid \( k \) values based on the given position \( n \) and number \( x \).

Let's break down the necessary steps to solve the problem correctly:

1. **Understanding the Pattern**:
   - The pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
   - For positions within the first \( k \) positions, the number is simply the position.
   - For positions within the next \( k - 2 \) positions, the number is \( k - (position - k + 1) \).

2. **Finding Valid \( k \)**:
   - For a given \( n \) and \( x \), we need to find all \( k \) such that the pattern at position \( n \) results in number \( x \).
   - This involves checking the pattern for each possible \( k \) starting from 2 up to a reasonable limit (since \( n \leq 10^9 \), \( k \) should be much smaller).

3. **Implementation**:
   - For each possible \( k \), determine the number at position \( n \) based on the described pattern.
   - Check if this number matches \( x \).
   - Count the number of valid \( k \) values.

The provided code does not implement this logic. It seems to be attempting to generate factors of a number, which is not directly related to solving the problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The logic for determining valid \( k \) values based on the position \( n \) and number \( x \) is missing.
