The code snippet `yield 1` is a generator statement that will produce the value `1` when the generator is iterated over, but it does not change the values of any variables in the current scope. Therefore, the values of `k`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `n` and `x` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, and k equals the length of the list primes. The value `1` is yielded.**
