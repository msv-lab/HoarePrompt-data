Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `n` and `x` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)`, and `k` is not equal to the length of primes.**

In this output state, the value of `rest` is determined by the function `generate(k + 1)`. The values of `k`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged, and the condition that `k` is not equal to the length of primes still holds.
