#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` greater than 1 and yields its prime factors. The prime factors are generated and yielded one by one, without modifying the original input `n`.

    #State: `k` is a non-negative integer, `n` and `x` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, and `primes` is a list of integers. If `k` equals the length of the list `primes`, the value `1` is yielded. Otherwise, a sequence of values is generated by the loop, where each value is of the form `factor * prime^i` for `factor` in `rest` and `i` ranging from `0` to `factors[prime]`. The variables `k`, `n`, `x`, `primes`, and `rest` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `generate` is a generator that yields a sequence of values based on a list of primes and their respective factors. It recursively generates combinations of these primes raised to different powers and multiplied by previously generated factors. The final state of the program after it concludes is that it has yielded all possible combinations of the form `factor * prime^i` for each prime in the list and for `i` ranging from `0` to the power specified in the `factors` dictionary. The variables `k`, `n`, `x`, `primes`, and `rest` remain unchanged throughout the execution.
