Postcondition: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `n` and `x` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, and `primes` is a list of integers. If `k` equals the length of the list `primes`, the value `1` is yielded. Otherwise, a sequence of values is generated by the loop, where each value is of the form `factor * prime^i` for `factor` in `rest` and `i` ranging from `0` to `factors[prime]`. The variables `k`, `n`, `x`, `primes`, and `rest` remain unchanged.**
