### Reasoning:
The provided program does not solve the given problem correctly. The task is to determine the number of possible values of \( k \) such that Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received \( x \) fit the described settling pattern.

The provided code consists of two functions, `func_1` and `generate`, which appear to be intended to generate factors of a number. However, the code does not directly address the problem of finding valid \( k \) values based on the given position \( n \) and number \( x \).

Let's break down the necessary steps to solve the problem correctly:

1. **Understanding the Pattern**:
   - The pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
   - For positions within the first \( k \) positions, the number is simply the position.
   - For positions within the next \( k - 2 \) positions, the number is \( k - (position - k + 1) \).

2. **Finding Valid \( k \)**:
   - For a given \( n \) and \( x \), we need to find all \( k \) such that the pattern at position \( n \) results in number \( x \).
   - This involves checking the pattern for each possible \( k \) starting from 2 up to a reasonable limit (since \( n \leq 10^9 \), \( k \) should be much smaller).

3. **Implementation**:
   - For each possible \( k \), determine the number at position \( n \) based on the described pattern.
   - Check if this number matches \( x \).
   - Count the number of valid \( k \) values.

The provided code does not implement this logic. It seems to be attempting to generate factors of a number, which is not directly related to solving the problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The logic for determining valid \( k \) values based on the position \( n \) and number \( x \) is missing.

Correctness: **False**
