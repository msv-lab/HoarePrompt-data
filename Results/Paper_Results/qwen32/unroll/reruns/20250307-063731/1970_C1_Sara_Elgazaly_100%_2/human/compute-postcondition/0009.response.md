To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to understand the behavior of the loop with the given initial state and the code inside the loop.

The loop is defined as:
```python
while lst[tmp] != []:
    one = not one
    tmp = lst[tmp].pop()
```

### Explanation of the Loop:
1. **Condition**: The loop continues as long as the list `lst[tmp]` is not empty.
2. **Body**:
   - `one = not one`: This toggles the boolean value of `one` between `True` and `False`.
   - `tmp = lst[tmp].pop()`: This removes and returns the last element from the list `lst[tmp]` and assigns it to `tmp`.

### Initial State:
- `tmp` is initially assigned the value of `z`.
- `one` is initially `True`.
- `lst` is a defaultdict of lists, where each key `a` has a list of integers `b` that were paired with `a` as read from the input.

### Loop Execution:
- The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in `lst[tmp]`.
- Each iteration, `tmp` is updated to the last element of `lst[tmp]`, and that element is removed from the list.
- The boolean `one` toggles between `True` and `False` with each iteration.

### Output State:
- The loop will terminate when `lst[tmp]` becomes empty.
- At this point, `tmp` will hold the last element that was popped from `lst[tmp]` before the list became empty.
- The boolean `one` will have toggled an even number of times if the number of elements in `lst[tmp]` is even, or an odd number of times if the number of elements is odd. Thus, if the number of elements is even, `one` will be `True`; if the number of elements is odd, `one` will be `False`.

### Conclusion:
The final state of `tmp` will be the last element that was popped from `lst[tmp]`, and `one` will be `True` if the number of elements in `lst[tmp]` is even, and `False` if it is odd.

### Output State:
**Output State: tmp is the last element popped from lst[tmp], and one is True if the number of elements in lst[tmp] is even, otherwise one is False.**

In simpler terms:
- `tmp` will be the last element in the sequence of elements that were popped from `lst[tmp]`.
- `one` will be `True` if the number of elements processed is even, and `False` if it is odd.
