The code snippet provided initializes a defaultdict named `lst`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, the edges, the starting nodes, or the integers `x` and `y`. The defaultdict `lst` is now an empty dictionary where each key will have a default value of an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v such that 1 <= u, v <= n representing the edges of the tree, and the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t such that 1 <= u_1, ..., u_t <= n representing the starting nodes for each round; `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input; `lst` is a defaultdict of lists.**
