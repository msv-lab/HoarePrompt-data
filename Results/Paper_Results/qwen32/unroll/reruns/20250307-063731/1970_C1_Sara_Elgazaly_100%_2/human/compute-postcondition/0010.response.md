The code snippet simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `two`. The variables `tmp` and `one` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains the same for `tmp` and `one`, while `two` is now `True`.

Output State: **`tmp` is the last element popped from `lst[tmp]`, and `one` is True if the number of elements in `lst[tmp]` is even, otherwise `one` is False; `two` is True.**
