The given code snippet initializes a new `defaultdict` named `rev`. This does not affect the existing variables `n`, `t`, `lst`, `x`, `y`, or the edges and starting nodes provided in the input. The only change is the introduction of the new `defaultdict` `rev`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v such that 1 <= u, v <= n representing the edges of the tree, and the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t such that 1 <= u_1, ..., u_t <= n representing the starting nodes for each round; `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input; `lst` is a defaultdict of lists; `rev` is a defaultdict of lists.**
