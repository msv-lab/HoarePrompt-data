Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v representing the edges of the tree, and the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t representing the starting nodes for each round; `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input; `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where each key `a` has a list of integers `b` that were paired with `a` as read from the input for `x - 1` iterations; `rev` is a defaultdict of lists where each key `b` has a list of integers `a` that were paired with `b` as read from the input for `x - 1` iterations; `z` is an input integer; `tmp` is assigned the value of `z`; `one` is True.
Code of the loop:
while lst[tmp] != []:
    one = not one
    tmp = lst[tmp].pop()



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
