The code `tmp = z` assigns the value of `z` to the variable `tmp`, overwriting the previous value of `tmp`. The values of `one` and `two` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is that `tmp` now holds the value of `z`, `one` retains its previous value (True if the number of elements in `lst[tmp]` was even, otherwise False), and `two` remains True.

Output State: **`tmp` is `z`, `one` is True if the number of elements in `lst[z]` is even, otherwise False; `two` is True.**
