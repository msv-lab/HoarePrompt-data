The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times. The loop will execute `x - 1` times. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `x - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `x` must be greater than 1.

The state of `n`, `t`, the edges, the starting nodes, `y`, `lst`, and `rev` do not affect whether the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v such that 1 <= u, v <= n representing the edges of the tree, and the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t such that 1 <= u_1, ..., u_t <= n representing the starting nodes for each round; `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an integer read from the input; `lst` is a defaultdict of lists; `rev` is a defaultdict of lists**
