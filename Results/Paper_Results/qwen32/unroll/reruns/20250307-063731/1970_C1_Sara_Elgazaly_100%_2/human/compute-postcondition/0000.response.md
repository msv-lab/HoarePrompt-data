The code provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The initial state mentions `n`, `t`, the edges of a tree, and starting nodes, but these variables are not affected by the provided code snippet. The only change is the introduction of `x` and `y` with the values read from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v such that 1 <= u, v <= n representing the edges of the tree, and the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t such that 1 <= u_1, ..., u_t <= n representing the starting nodes for each round; `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input.**
