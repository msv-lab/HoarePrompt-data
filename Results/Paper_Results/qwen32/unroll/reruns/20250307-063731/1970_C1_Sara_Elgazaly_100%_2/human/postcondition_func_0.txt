The function reads the description of a tree with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges, and a starting node. It then determines the final node reached by traversing the tree in two different directions (forward and reverse) from the starting node, and prints 'Hermione' if both traversals result in an even number of steps, otherwise it prints 'Ron'.
