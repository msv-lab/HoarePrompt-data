Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree, where 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. It also accepts `t`, an integer equal to 1, and the next `n-1` lines each contain two integers `u` and `v` representing the edges of the tree. The last line contains `t` integers `u_1, ..., u_t` representing the starting nodes for each round, where 1 <= u_1, ..., u_t <= n. The function returns a result based on the structure of the tree and the starting nodes provided.**
