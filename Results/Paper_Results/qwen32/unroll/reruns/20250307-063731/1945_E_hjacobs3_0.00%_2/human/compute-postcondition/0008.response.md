The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print(0)
```

This statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. The initial state provides information about the variable `l` and its relationship to the `array` and `find`, but this information is not relevant to the execution of the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement is simply printing the integer `0`, the output will be exactly that.

Output: **0**
