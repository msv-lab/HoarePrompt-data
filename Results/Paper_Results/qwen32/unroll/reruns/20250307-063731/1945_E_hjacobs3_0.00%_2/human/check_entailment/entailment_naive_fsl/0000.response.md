Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to ensure that the binary search algorithm will find the number `x` after performing at most 2 swaps. The program attempts to swap elements in the array to make `array[l]` equal to `x` after the binary search, but it does not guarantee that the binary search will work correctly after the swap.

Let's analyze the provided code:

1. The function `func_1` is supposed to perform the binary search and determine the necessary swaps.
2. The binary search is implemented incorrectly. The condition `if array[mid] >= find` and the subsequent assignments to `l` and `r` do not correctly implement the binary search algorithm.
3. After the binary search, the program checks if `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in the array. If not, it attempts to swap the elements at positions `l` and `find`, but this does not guarantee that the binary search will work correctly after the swap.
4. The program does not handle cases where the array needs to be rearranged in such a way that the binary search will find `x` after at most 2 swaps.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

```
1
5 3
5 4 3 2 1
```

The correct output should be something like:

```
2
1 3
2 4
```

But the provided program will not produce the correct output for this case. The binary search logic is flawed and the swaps are not correctly determined.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
