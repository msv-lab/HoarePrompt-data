Reasoning:  
The provided program is attempting to solve the problem by using binary search to find the position of the element `x` in the permutation `array`. However, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the necessary swaps to ensure that after performing the binary search, the element at position `l` is equal to `x`. 

The current implementation of `func_1` performs a binary search to find the position `l` where `array[l]` is the smallest element that is greater than or equal to `x`. If `l` is not the index of `x` in the array, it suggests a single swap between `l` and the position of `x`. However, this logic is flawed because:
1. The binary search should stop when `r - l = 1`, not `l <= r`.
2. The binary search logic itself is incorrect. The condition `if array[mid] >= find` should be `if array[mid] < find` to correctly find the position `l` such that `array[l]` is the smallest element greater than or equal to `x`.
3. The output format and the way the swaps are determined do not align with the problem requirements. The program should output the number of swaps and the indices of the elements to be swapped, not the positions found during the binary search.
4. The program does not handle cases where `x` is not present in the array correctly, and it does not ensure that the array is in a state where binary search can correctly identify `x` after at most two swaps.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
