Let's systematically analyze the problem, the provided code, the annotations, and the original assessment.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find a number `x` in a permutation `p` using a binary search after performing at most 2 swaps. The binary search algorithm requires the array to be sorted, but we can perform up to 2 swaps to ensure that the element `x` is found correctly after the binary search.

### Code Analysis
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search algorithm in `func_1` is not correctly implemented. The standard binary search for finding an element `x` should be:
     ```python
     while l <= r:
         mid = (l + r) // 2
         if array[mid] == x:
             return mid
         elif array[mid] < x:
             l = mid + 1
         else:
             r = mid - 1
     ```
   - The provided code uses a different condition (`array[mid] >= find`) which does not correctly perform a binary search. It finds the smallest index `l` such that `array[l] >= find`.

2. **Handling Swaps**:
   - After the binary search, the code checks if `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in the array. If not, it swaps the elements at positions `l` and `find`. However, this does not guarantee that the binary search will work correctly after the swap.
   - The code does not consider the possibility of performing up to 2 swaps to correctly place `x` such that the binary search will find it.

### Annotations
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- After the binary search, `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l] >= find`, or `l` is `n` if `find` is greater than all elements in the array.
- If `l` is not equal to the index of `find`, it prints `1` and returns the indices to be swapped. Otherwise, it prints `0`.

### Original Assessment
The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not correctly implement the solution. The binary search is flawed, and the logic for determining the swaps is insufficient.

### Conclusion
The provided program is incorrect because:
- The binary search logic is incorrect.
- The logic for determining the swaps is insufficient to ensure that the binary search will find `x` after at most 2 swaps.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
