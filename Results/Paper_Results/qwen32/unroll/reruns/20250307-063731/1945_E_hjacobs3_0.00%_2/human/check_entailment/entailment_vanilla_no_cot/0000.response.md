Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search implementation in `func_1` is incorrect. The loop condition should be `l < r` instead of `l <= r` to properly handle the binary search logic. The logic for updating `l` and `r` should also be corrected.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Swaps**: The program only checks if the final `l` pointer is at the correct position for the element `x`. However, if it's not, it only suggests one swap, which may not be sufficient. The problem guarantees that up to two swaps can be performed to achieve the correct result, but the current logic does not account for this.

3. **Output Handling**: The function `func_1` is expected to return the number of swaps and the indices of the swaps, but the current implementation prints the number of swaps and the indices directly, which is not the correct approach as per the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where `x` is at the beginning or end of the array, or when `x` is already in the correct position after the binary search.

Here is an outline of a correct approach:

1. Perform a binary search to find the position where `x` should be.
2. If `x` is not at the correct position, determine the necessary swaps to bring `x` to the correct position.
3. Ensure that the number of swaps does not exceed 2.
4. Return the number of swaps and the indices of the swaps.

A correct implementation would involve more detailed logic to handle the swaps and ensure that the binary search conditions are met correctly.
