### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem by performing up to two swaps on the permutation array to ensure that a binary search will correctly identify the position of the target value `x`. However, there are several issues with the current implementation of `func_1` that make it incorrect:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search in `func_1` is incorrectly implemented. The condition `if array[mid] >= find` should be `if array[mid] < find` to correctly narrow down the search space. The current implementation will not correctly identify the smallest index `l` such that `array[l] >= find`.

2. **Swapping Logic**: The logic for swapping elements to ensure that the binary search will find `x` is flawed. The program swaps elements to make `array[l]` equal to `x` after the binary search, but it does not guarantee that the binary search will correctly identify `x` as the target value after the swaps.

3. **Return Value**: The function is supposed to return a list of strings representing the operations performed. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the case where the binary search already places `l` at the correct position. Additionally, it does not handle the case where two swaps are necessary.

4. **Undefined Behavior**: The function does not handle the case where `x` is not in the array, although the problem guarantees that `x` will always be in the permutation.

Given these issues, the program as written does not correctly solve the problem as described.
