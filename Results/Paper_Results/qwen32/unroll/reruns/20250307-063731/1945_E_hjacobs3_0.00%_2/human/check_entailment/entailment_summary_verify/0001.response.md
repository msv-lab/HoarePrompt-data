### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several critical issues with the provided program. Let's break down the reasoning in detail:

1. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The binary search algorithm implemented in `func_1` assumes that the array is sorted. However, the array is a permutation and is not necessarily sorted. This means that the binary search as implemented will not correctly find the position of `x` in the unsorted array.

2. **Incorrect Swap Logic:**
   - The program attempts to perform at most one swap to align the binary search result with the actual position of `x`. However, the problem guarantees that up to two swaps are necessary to ensure the binary search correctly identifies `x`. The current logic is insufficient to handle cases where two swaps are required.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the number of swaps and the swap operations in a format that does not always match the expected output. For example, if no swaps are needed, it should simply print `0`. If swaps are needed, it should print the correct number of swaps and the correct indices.

4. **Function Summary:**
   - The function summary provided does not accurately describe the intended behavior of `func_1`. The function is supposed to help in determining the necessary swaps to make the binary search work, but the summary does not reflect this correctly. Instead, it describes a binary search operation that assumes the array is sorted.

### Conclusion:
Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. The binary search logic is flawed, the swap logic is insufficient, and the output format is not always correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
