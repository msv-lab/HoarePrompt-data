Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n) that needs to be found in the permutation, `n` is the length of the array.**

Natural language: The variable `n` has been assigned the value of the length of the `array`. The other variables, `array` and `find`, remain unchanged.
