The `print(1)` statement in the given Python code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or conditions described in the initial state. The initial state provides information about the variable `l` and its relationship to the `array` and `find`, but this information is not relevant to the execution of the `print(1)` statement.

Since the `print(1)` statement is hardcoded to print the integer `1`, the output will be `1`.

Output: **1**
