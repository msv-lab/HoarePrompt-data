Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `array`, which is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n containing distinct integers from 1 to n, and `find`, which is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n) that needs to be found in the permutation. The function returns a list containing two strings. The first string is the value of (l + 1), where l is the smallest index such that `array[l]` is greater than or equal to `find`, or l is n if `find` is greater than all elements in the array. The second string is the value of (index of `find` in the array + 1), which is the position of the element `find` in the array plus one.**
