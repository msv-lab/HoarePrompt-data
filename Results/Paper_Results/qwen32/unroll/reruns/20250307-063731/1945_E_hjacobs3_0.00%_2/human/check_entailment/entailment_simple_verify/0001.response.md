### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several critical issues with the provided program:

1. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The binary search implemented in `func_1` assumes the array is sorted, which it is not. The problem requires using binary search on an unsorted permutation by strategically performing up to 2 swaps to facilitate the search.
   - The current implementation does not account for the need to sort the relevant portion of the array or ensure that the binary search conditions are met after the swaps.

2. **Incorrect Swap Logic:**
   - The program only considers one swap operation to align `l` with the index of `x`. However, the problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient, and the program does not implement this correctly.
   - The logic for determining the swaps is flawed. The program should strategically place `x` in a position where the binary search will correctly identify it, potentially requiring two swaps to achieve this.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the swap operations in a format that matches the expected output format, but the logic for determining these operations is incorrect.

### Detailed Analysis Using Annotations:

- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - The array is a permutation of length `n` containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
  - `find` is the integer that needs to be found in the permutation.

- **Inside `func_1`:**
  - The binary search logic is flawed because it does not account for the unsorted nature of the array.
  - The state after the binary search loop is that `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l] >= find`, or `l` is `n` if `find` is greater than all elements in the array.
  - The condition `if (l != array.index(find))` checks if `l` points to the correct index of `x`. However, this condition does not guarantee that a binary search will correctly identify `x` after the swap, as it only considers a single swap.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly solve the problem because:
- It does not properly handle the unsorted nature of the array.
- It only considers one swap, which is insufficient in many cases.
- The logic for determining the swaps is flawed.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
