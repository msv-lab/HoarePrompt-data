### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several critical issues with the provided program. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The binary search algorithm assumes that the array is sorted. However, the problem states that the array is a permutation (not sorted), and the binary search should work on the original array after performing up to 2 swaps.
   - The current implementation of the binary search in `func_1` is not applicable to an unsorted permutation.

2. **Incorrect Swap Logic:**
   - The program attempts to perform a single swap if the binary search result (`l`) does not match the index of `x` in the original array. This approach is flawed because:
     - It does not guarantee that a single swap will make the binary search work correctly.
     - The problem states that 2 swaps are always sufficient, but the program does not handle this requirement.
     - The program does not correctly identify the necessary swaps to make the binary search work as intended.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The output format of the swap operations is correct in terms of syntax, but the logic behind the swaps is incorrect. The program should output up to 2 swap operations if necessary, but it only considers one swap in most cases.

4. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points, but they do not address the core issue of the incorrect binary search and swap logic.
   - The annotations confirm that the binary search logic is flawed and that the swap logic is insufficient.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the original assessment, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The binary search is not applicable to an unsorted permutation, and the swap logic does not ensure that the binary search will correctly identify the position of `x` after up to 2 swaps.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
