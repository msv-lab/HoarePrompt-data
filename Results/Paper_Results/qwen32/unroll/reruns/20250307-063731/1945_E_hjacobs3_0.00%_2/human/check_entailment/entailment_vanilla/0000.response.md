Let's analyze the provided program step by step and determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find a number `x` in a permutation `p` using a modified binary search algorithm. Before performing the binary search, we can perform up to 2 swaps to ensure that the binary search will correctly identify the position of `x`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n` and the number to be found `x`.
   - It then reads the permutation `array`.

2. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The binary search is performed in `func_1`.
   - The binary search algorithm is implemented with the following logic:
     - Initialize `l` to 0 and `r` to `n - 1`.
     - While `l <= r`, calculate the middle index `mid`.
     - If the value at `mid` is greater than or equal to `x`, adjust `r` to `mid - 1`.
     - Otherwise, adjust `l` to `mid + 1`.
   - After the loop, the variable `l` should ideally point to the position of `x` in the sorted array.

3. **Swapping Logic:**
   - If the value of `l` does not match the index of `x` in the original array, the program plans to perform a swap.
   - It prints `1` indicating one swap and suggests swapping the element at `l + 1` with the element at the index of `x` in the original array.
   - If `l` already points to the index of `x`, it prints `0` indicating no swaps.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of swaps and the swap operations if needed.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The binary search implemented in `func_1` is not suitable for the problem because it assumes the array is sorted, which it is not.
   - The binary search should be performed on the sorted version of the array, but the problem requires us to perform swaps to make the binary search work on the original array.

2. **Incorrect Swap Logic:**
   - The program attempts to swap elements to make the binary search work, but the logic is incorrect.
   - The program only considers one swap, which is insufficient in many cases. The problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient, but the program does not handle this correctly.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the swap operations in a format that does not match the expected output format.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
