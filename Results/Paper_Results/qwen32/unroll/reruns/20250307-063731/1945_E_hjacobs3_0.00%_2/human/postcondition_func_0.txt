The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `array`, which is a permutation of distinct integers from 1 to n, and an integer `find` within the same range. It returns a list containing two strings. The first string represents the position (1-based index) of the smallest element in `array` that is greater than or equal to `find`. If no such element exists, it represents the position just beyond the last element of the array. The second string represents the position (1-based index) of the element `find` in the array. If `find` is not in the array, the behavior is undefined as per the provided code.
