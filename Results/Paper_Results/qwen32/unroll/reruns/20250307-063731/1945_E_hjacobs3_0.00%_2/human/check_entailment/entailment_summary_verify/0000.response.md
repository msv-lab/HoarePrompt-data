### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to ensure that the binary search algorithm will find the number `x` after performing at most 2 swaps. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Binary Search Implementation Error**:
   - The binary search logic in `func_1` is flawed. The condition `if array[mid] >= find` and the subsequent assignments to `l` and `r` do not correctly implement the binary search algorithm. The correct condition should be:
     - If `array[mid] < find`, then `l = mid + 1` (move the left pointer to the right).
     - If `array[mid] >= find`, then `r = mid` (move the right pointer to the middle).

2. **Incorrect Handling of Swaps**:
   - After the binary search, the program checks if `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in the array. If not, it attempts to swap the elements at positions `l` and `find`. However, this does not guarantee that the binary search will work correctly after the swap. The program does not handle cases where the array needs to be rearranged in such a way that the binary search will find `x` after at most 2 swaps.
   - For example, in the test case:
     ```
     1
     5 3
     5 4 3 2 1
     ```
     The correct output should be something like:
     ```
     2
     1 3
     2 4
     ```
     But the provided program will not produce the correct output for this case.

3. **Function Summary Misinterpretation**:
   - The function summary provided does not fully capture the intended behavior of the function `func_1`. The function is supposed to return a list of swaps that will allow the binary search to find `x` after at most 2 swaps, but the current implementation does not achieve this.

### Conclusion:
Given the above points, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic to ensure that the binary search algorithm will find the number `x` after performing at most 2 swaps.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
