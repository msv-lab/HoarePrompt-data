The code snippet assigns the value `0` to `l` and the value `n - 1` to `r`. The other variables (`array`, `find`, and `n`) remain unchanged. The output state reflects these changes.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n) that needs to be found in the permutation, `n` is the length of the array, `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1.**
