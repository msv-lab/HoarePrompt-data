Reasoning:  
The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The function `func_1` is intended to determine the necessary swaps to make the binary search algorithm find the correct element `x` in the permutation. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the binary search logic and the conditions for swapping elements. Specifically, the function does not perform any actual swaps on the array before performing the binary search. Instead, it only checks if the current index `l` after the binary search matches the index of `x` in the array and prints the indices for a swap if they do not match. This approach does not guarantee that the binary search will find `x` after the swaps, as it does not actually modify the array and only prints the indices for potential swaps.

The binary search logic in `func_1` is also incorrect. The loop condition `while l <= r` should be `while l < r` to correctly handle the binary search. Additionally, the logic for updating `l` and `r` should be adjusted to ensure that `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l] >= x` after the binary search completes. The current implementation does not correctly handle these conditions.

Furthermore, the function does not perform any actual swaps on the array, which is necessary to ensure that the binary search will find `x`. The function only prints the indices for potential swaps, but the actual swaps are not performed on the array.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
