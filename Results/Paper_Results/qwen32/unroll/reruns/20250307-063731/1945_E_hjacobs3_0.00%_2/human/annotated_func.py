#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to n, and find is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n) that needs to be found in the permutation. The function is called multiple times for different test cases, with the total length of all permutations not exceeding 2⋅10^5.
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] >= find:
            r = mid - 1
        else:
            l = mid + 1
        
    #State: l is the smallest index such that array[l] >= find, or l is n if find is greater than all elements in the array.
    if (l != array.index(find)) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
        #The program returns a list containing two strings. The first string is the value of (l + 1), where l is the smallest index such that array[l] >= find, or l is n if find is greater than all elements in the array. The second string is the value of (array.index(find) + 1), which is the index of the element 'find' in the array plus one.
    else :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l] >= find`, or `l` is `n` if `find` is greater than all elements in the array. Additionally, `l` is equal to `array.index(find)` if `find` is present in the array.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `array`, which is a permutation of distinct integers from 1 to n, and an integer `find` within the same range. It returns a list containing two strings. The first string represents the position (1-based index) of the smallest element in `array` that is greater than or equal to `find`. If no such element exists, it represents the position just beyond the last element of the array. The second string represents the position (1-based index) of the element `find` in the array. If `find` is not in the array, the behavior is undefined as per the provided code.
