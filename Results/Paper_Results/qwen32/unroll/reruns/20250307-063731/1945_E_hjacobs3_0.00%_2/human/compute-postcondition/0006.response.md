Output State: **The program returns a list containing two strings. The first string is the value of (l + 1), where l is the smallest index such that array[l] >= find, or l is n if find is greater than all elements in the array. The second string is the value of (array.index(find) + 1), which is the index of the element 'find' in the array plus one.**

In simple terms:
- The first part of the output is a string representation of the index `l + 1`, where `l` is the smallest index where the array value is greater than or equal to `find`, or the length of the array if `find` is greater than all elements.
- The second part of the output is a string representation of the index of `find` in the array plus one.
