In the given `while` loop, the condition is `l <= r`. This means that the loop will execute as long as the value of `l` is less than or equal to the value of `r`.

Given the initial states:
- `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
- `find` is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n) that needs to be found in the permutation.
- `n` is the length of the array.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 1`.

Let's analyze the condition `l <= r`:
- `l` is initialized to 0.
- `r` is initialized to `n - 1`.

Since `n` is at least 1 (as per the problem statement, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), `r` will be at least 0 when `n` is 1. Therefore, `l` (which is 0) will always be less than or equal to `r` (which is at least 0).

This means that the condition `l <= r` will always be true for any valid `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and the loop can certainly execute at least once.

Thus, no adjustments to the state are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `find` is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n) that needs to be found in the permutation, `n` is the length of the array, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`**
