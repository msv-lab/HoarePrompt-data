You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to n, and find is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n) that needs to be found in the permutation. The function is called multiple times for different test cases, with the total length of all permutations not exceeding 2⋅10^5.
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] >= find:
            r = mid - 1
        else:
            l = mid + 1
        
    #State: l is the smallest index such that array[l] >= find, or l is n if find is greater than all elements in the array.
    if (l != array.index(find)) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
        #The program returns a list containing two strings. The first string is the value of (l + 1), where l is the smallest index such that array[l] >= find, or l is n if find is greater than all elements in the array. The second string is the value of (array.index(find) + 1), which is the index of the element 'find' in the array plus one.
    else :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l] >= find`, or `l` is `n` if `find` is greater than all elements in the array. Additionally, `l` is equal to `array.index(find)` if `find` is present in the array.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to ensure that the binary search algorithm will find the number `x` after performing at most 2 swaps. The program attempts to swap elements in the array to make `array[l]` equal to `x` after the binary search, but it does not guarantee that the binary search will work correctly after the swap.

Let's analyze the provided code:

1. The function `func_1` is supposed to perform the binary search and determine the necessary swaps.
2. The binary search is implemented incorrectly. The condition `if array[mid] >= find` and the subsequent assignments to `l` and `r` do not correctly implement the binary search algorithm.
3. After the binary search, the program checks if `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in the array. If not, it attempts to swap the elements at positions `l` and `find`, but this does not guarantee that the binary search will work correctly after the swap.
4. The program does not handle cases where the array needs to be rearranged in such a way that the binary search will find `x` after at most 2 swaps.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

```
1
5 3
5 4 3 2 1
```

The correct output should be something like:

```
2
1 3
2 4
```

But the provided program will not produce the correct output for this case. The binary search logic is flawed and the swaps are not correctly determined.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
