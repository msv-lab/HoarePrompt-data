Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells. The program simply prints points along the first row of the grid, which results in a very limited set of Manhattan distances. Specifically, the only possible Manhattan distances between any two points printed by the program will be of the form \(|1-1| + |i-j| = |i-j|\), where \(i\) and \(j\) are the column indices of the points. This results in a set of Manhattan distances that is at most \(\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}\), which is far from maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

To maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), one should strategically place the points in such a way that the differences in both the x and y coordinates are maximized. This can be achieved by placing points along a diagonal or in a pattern that ensures a wide range of Manhattan distances. The examples in the problem statement demonstrate such placements.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
