Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. The current implementation simply prints points along the first row of the grid (i.e., \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), ..., \((1, n)\)). This results in only one distinct Manhattan distance (other than 0), which is 1.

To maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), the points should be strategically placed to cover a wide range of Manhattan distances. The examples provided in the problem description show more optimal placements for different values of \(n\). For instance, for \(n = 3\), the points \((2, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((3, 1)\) are used to achieve a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Here is a corrected version of the program that follows the pattern shown in the examples:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        points = []
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if i <= (n + 1) // 2:
                points.append((1, i))
            else:
                points.append((n, i - (n + 1) // 2))
        for x, y in points:
            print(x, y)

func()
```

This program places points in a way that maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances, following the pattern shown in the examples for different values of \(n\).
