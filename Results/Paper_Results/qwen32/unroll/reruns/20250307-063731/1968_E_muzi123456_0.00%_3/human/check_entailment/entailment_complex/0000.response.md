Reasoning:  
The provided program is designed to read multiple test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n`. For each test case, the program prints `n` points, each with the x-coordinate as `1` and the y-coordinate ranging from `1` to `n`. After printing the points for each test case, it prints an additional blank line.

However, the goal of the problem is to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of points. The current implementation places all points in the first column of the grid, which results in only one distinct Manhattan distance for any pair of points (except for the distance between a point and itself, which is 0). This is clearly not an optimal solution for maximizing the number of distinct Manhattan distances.

For example, in the case of \(n = 3\), the current implementation will output points (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3). The set \(\mathcal{H}\) will only contain {0, 1, 2}, which has a size of 3. However, an optimal arrangement could be points (2,1), (2,3), and (3,1), which results in the set \(\mathcal{H}\) containing {0, 1, 2, 3}, which has a size of 4.

Therefore, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

Correctness: **False**
