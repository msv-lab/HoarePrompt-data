Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for each test case. The program always places all chosen cells in the first row of the grid, which results in a very limited set of Manhattan distances.

For example, consider the case when \(n = 3\):
- The program will output:
  ```
  1 1
  1 2
  1 3
  ```
- The set \(\mathcal{H}\) in this case will be \(\{0, 1, 2\}\) because all points are in the same row, and the Manhattan distance between any two points will only depend on the difference in their column indices.

However, the optimal arrangement for \(n = 3\) is:
- Points: \((2, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), \((3, 1)\)
- The set \(\mathcal{H}\) in this case will be \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which is larger.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, as it does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\).
