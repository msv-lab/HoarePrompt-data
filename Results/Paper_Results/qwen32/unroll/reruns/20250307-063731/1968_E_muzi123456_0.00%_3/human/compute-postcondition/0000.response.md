The code provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This affects the value of `t` but does not change the precondition for the value of `t` which is that it should be an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive. The variable `n` and its precondition remain unchanged as the code does not affect `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^3.**
