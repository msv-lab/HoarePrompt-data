### Reasoning:
The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, where for each test case, it outputs `n` points in a grid of size `n x n`. The points are chosen such that the first coordinate is always `1`, and the second coordinate ranges from `1` to `n`. 

However, the problem requires maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells. The provided program does not achieve this goal. 

By placing all points on the same row (first row in this case), the only possible Manhattan distances between any pair of points are `0` (for the same point) and `|i - j|` where `i` and `j` are the column indices of the points. This results in a limited set of Manhattan distances, which is not optimal for maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

To maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances, a better strategy would be to distribute the points in a way that maximizes the variety of distances. For example, placing points at `(1, 1)`, `(1, 3)`, `(4, 3)`, `(4, 4)` for `n=4` as shown in the example output achieves a larger set of distinct distances.

Given that the provided program does not follow this strategy and instead places all points in the same row, it does not solve the problem correctly.
