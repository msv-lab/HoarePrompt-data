### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program provided and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases using `func_10()` which reads an integer from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` using `func_7()` which reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers.

2. **Core Logic**:
   - The function `func_16()` is the main function that processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_15()` which is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` satisfying the given conditions.

3. **Logic in `func_15()`**:
   - The function `func_15()` initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
   - It then enters a loop that continues as long as `i * i` is less than or equal to `n + i`.
   - Inside the loop, it increments `ans` by `(n + i) // (i * i)`.
   - It increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

The logic in `func_15()` appears to be incorrect for the given problem. The problem requires checking all pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m` and counting those pairs where `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The provided function `func_15()` does not perform this check.

### Correctness:

Based on the analysis, the logic in `func_15()` is not aligned with the problem requirements. It does not correctly count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`.

**Correctness: False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.
