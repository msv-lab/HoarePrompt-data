The function `func_14` accepts a list of integers `a`, and two positive integers `n` and `m` such that 0 <= n <= len(a), and another integer `k`. It returns 1 if the integer `k` is non-negative after being decremented by the sum of `(m - a[i])` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)` where `a[i]` is less than `m`. Otherwise, it returns -1.
