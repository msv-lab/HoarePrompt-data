Reasoning:

The given Python program contains multiple functions, but only one of them, `func_15()`, seems to be relevant to the problem at hand. The problem requires us to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

Let's analyze `func_15()`:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

This function reads two integers `n` and `m` using `func_7()`. However, it only uses `n` and ignores `m`. The function then iterates over values of `i` starting from 1, and for each `i`, it adds `(n + i) // (i * i)` to `ans` as long as `i * i` is less than or equal to `n + i`. Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

This approach does not seem to follow the logic required by the problem. The condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is not being checked at all. The function seems to be counting something else entirely.

Given that the function `func_16()` calls `func_15()` for each test case, and `func_15()` does not implement the required logic, the entire program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
