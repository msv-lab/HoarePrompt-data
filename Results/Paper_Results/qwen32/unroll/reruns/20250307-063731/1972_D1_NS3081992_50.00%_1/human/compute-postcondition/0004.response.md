To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to analyze the loop and how it modifies the variables.

### Loop Analysis

**Initial State:**
- `n` and `m` are positive integers with 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `ans` is initialized to 0.

**Loop Condition:**
- The loop continues as long as `i * i <= n + i`.

**Loop Body:**
- `ans` is incremented by `(n + i) // (i * i)`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

### Execution Process

The loop iterates as long as `i * i` is less than or equal to `n + i`. In each iteration, the value of `ans` is updated by adding the integer division of `n + i` by `i * i`.

### Output State Calculation

To find the final value of `ans`, we need to sum up the values of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` starting from 1 until `i * i` exceeds `n + i`.

Let's consider a few iterations to understand the pattern:

1. **First Iteration (i = 1):**
   - Condition: `1 * 1 <= n + 1` (always true for positive `n`)
   - `ans += (n + 1) // (1 * 1) = n + 1`
   - `i` becomes 2.

2. **Second Iteration (i = 2):**
   - Condition: `2 * 2 <= n + 2` (i.e., `4 <= n + 2` or `n >= 2`)
   - `ans += (n + 2) // (2 * 2) = (n + 2) // 4`
   - `i` becomes 3.

3. **General Iteration (i = k):**
   - Condition: `k * k <= n + k`
   - `ans += (n + k) // (k * k)`

The loop stops when `k * k` exceeds `n + k`. At this point, the final value of `ans` is the sum of all the integer divisions calculated in each iteration.

### Conclusion

The output state after the loop finishes executing is determined by the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 until `i * i` exceeds `n + i`.

**Output State: **the final value of `ans` after all iterations.**

Since the exact value of `ans` depends on the specific values of `n` and `m` (though `m` is not used in the loop), the output state is expressed in terms of the computed `ans`.

Output State: **the final value of `ans` after all iterations.**

In natural language: The output state is the final value of `ans` after the loop has completed all its iterations, which is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` starting from 1 until `i * i` exceeds `n + i`.
