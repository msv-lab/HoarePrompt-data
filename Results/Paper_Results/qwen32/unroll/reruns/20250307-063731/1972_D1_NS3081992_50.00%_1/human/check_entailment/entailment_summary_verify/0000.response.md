### Reasoning:

The original assessment states that the provided program is incorrect because `func_15()` does not properly check the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The function `func_15()` indeed does not seem to implement the correct logic for this condition, as it uses a loop that iterates up to the square root of `n + i` and counts pairs based on a different logic.

To verify this, let's re-examine the problem and the provided function `func_15()`:

- **Problem Condition**: We need to count the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

- **Function `func_15()`**:
  ```python
  def func_15():
      (n, m) = func_7()
      i = 1
      ans = 0
      while i * i <= n + i:
          ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
          i += 1
      return ans - 1
  ```

  This function calculates a value based on iterating up to the square root of `n + i` and does not explicitly check the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

- **Function Summary**: The function summary indicates that `func_16()` prints the number 1, `m` times, each on a new line. This is incorrect based on the provided code, as `func_16()` actually prints the result of `func_15()` for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The function `func_15()` does not implement the correct logic to solve the given problem, and the program as a whole does not produce the correct output for the problem described.

### Final: **False**
