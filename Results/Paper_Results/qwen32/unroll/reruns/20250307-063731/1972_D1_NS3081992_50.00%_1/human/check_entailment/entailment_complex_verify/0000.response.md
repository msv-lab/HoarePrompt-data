### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem statement and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
The task is to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Code Analysis:
The main function responsible for calculating the number of valid pairs is `func_15()`. Here's the relevant part of the code:

```python
def func_15():
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

The logic here seems to be counting pairs based on a different condition or formula. Let's break it down:
- The loop iterates up to the square root of \(n + i\).
- For each \(i\), it adds \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to the answer.
- Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

This logic does not directly check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the counterexample provided in the original assessment:
- For \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\), the correct number of valid pairs is 14.

The provided function `func_15()` does not correctly compute this value. Here's why:
- The function `func_15()` uses a different logic that does not match the problem's requirements.
- The function does not iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, the function should:
1. Iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
2. For each pair, check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
3. Count the number of valid pairs.

The provided function `func_15()` does not implement this logic.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
