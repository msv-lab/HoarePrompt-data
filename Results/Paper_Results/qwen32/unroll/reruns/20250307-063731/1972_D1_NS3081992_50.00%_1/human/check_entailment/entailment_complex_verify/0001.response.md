### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_15()` does not implement the logic required by the problem description. The problem requires counting ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, `func_15()` only uses `n` and ignores `m`, and its logic does not match the problem's requirements.

Here's a closer look at `func_15()`:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

- **Reading Input:** The function reads two integers `n` and `m` using `func_7()`, but `m` is not used.
- **Loop and Calculation:** The function iterates over values of `i` starting from 1. For each `i`, it adds \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to `ans` as long as \(i * i \le n + i\).
- **Return Statement:** Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

The logic in `func_15()` does not involve checking whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it performs a different calculation that is unrelated to the problem.

### Annotations:

The annotations provide a detailed description of each function, including `func_15()`. They confirm that `func_15()` reads `n` and `m` but only uses `n` in its calculations. The annotations do not provide any evidence that `func_15()` implements the required logic.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis and the annotations, the original assessment is correct. The program is incorrect because `func_15()` does not implement the logic required by the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
