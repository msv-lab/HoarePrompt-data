No variables are present in the function signature. The function `func_7` is not directly related to the problem description provided. However, based on the context and typical usage, it seems to read a line of input and return a list of integers. If we were to infer a precondition for a function with parameters similar to those used in the problem, it might be something like: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
