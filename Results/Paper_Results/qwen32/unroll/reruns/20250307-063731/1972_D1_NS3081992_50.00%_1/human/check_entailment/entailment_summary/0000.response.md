Reasoning: 

The provided code does not correctly solve the given problem. The function `func_16` is supposed to handle multiple test cases and for each test case, it should calculate and print the number of valid ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions. However, the function `func_15` is called within `func_16` without passing the test case values (n, m) to it. 

Function `func_15` is supposed to compute the number of valid pairs (a, b) for specific values of n and m, but it does not accept any parameters. Instead, it calls `func_7` to read the next line of input, which is not aligned with the logic required for the problem.

The logic for solving the problem involves iterating through possible values of a and b, checking if the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is satisfied, and counting the number of such pairs. However, the provided code does not implement this logic.

Given the incorrect usage of functions and the lack of logic to solve the problem, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
