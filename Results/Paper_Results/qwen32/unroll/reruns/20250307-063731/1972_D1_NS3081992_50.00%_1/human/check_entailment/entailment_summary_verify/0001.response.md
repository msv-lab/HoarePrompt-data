Reasoning: 

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not solve the given problem. Let's break down the problem and the code to understand why.

### Problem Breakdown
The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Code Analysis
The code consists of multiple functions, but only `func_15()` and `func_16()` are relevant to solving the problem. Here's the relevant part of the code:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1

def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
```

#### Function `func_15()`
- Reads two integers `n` and `m` using `func_7()`.
- Ignores `m` and only uses `n`.
- Iterates over values of `i` starting from 1, and for each `i`, it adds `(n + i) // (i * i)` to `ans` as long as `i * i` is less than or equal to `n + i`.
- Returns `ans - 1`.

#### Function `func_16()`
- Calls `func_15()` for each test case and prints the result.

### Evaluation
The function `func_15()` does not implement the logic required by the problem. It does not check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it performs a different calculation that is unrelated to the problem statement.

The function summary for `func_16()` also indicates that it prints the number 1, `m` times, which is incorrect based on the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion
Given that `func_15()` does not correctly implement the required logic and `func_16()` relies on `func_15()`, the entire program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
