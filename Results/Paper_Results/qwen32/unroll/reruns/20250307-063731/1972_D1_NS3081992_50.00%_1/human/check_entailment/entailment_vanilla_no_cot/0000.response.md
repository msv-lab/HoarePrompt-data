Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The function `func_15` is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs (a, b) for a given n and m, but it does not implement the correct logic for the problem. The provided code seems to be solving a different problem or a simplified version of the problem.

Here's a brief analysis of why the provided function is incorrect:

1. The function `func_15` calculates something related to the sum of divisors and does not take into account the condition that `a + b` should be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
2. The loop in `func_15` iterates up to the square root of `n + i`, which is not relevant to the problem at hand.
3. The function does not iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) and check the given condition.
4. The function does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem description.

To solve the problem correctly, you would need to iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) within the given ranges and check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. This can be optimized using mathematical properties and number theory, but the provided code does not do this.
