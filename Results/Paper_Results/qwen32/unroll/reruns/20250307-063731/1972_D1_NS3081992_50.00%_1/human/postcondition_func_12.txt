The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` (where `b` is not necessarily greater than `a`). It returns three values: in the case where `b` is 0, it returns 1, 0, and `a`. Otherwise, it returns values `y`, `x - a // b * y`, and `g`, which are derived through recursive computation, likely related to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
