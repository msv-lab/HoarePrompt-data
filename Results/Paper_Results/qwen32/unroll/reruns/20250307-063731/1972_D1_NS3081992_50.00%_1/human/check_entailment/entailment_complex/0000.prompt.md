Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature. The function `func_7` is not directly related to the problem description provided. However, based on the context and typical usage, it seems to read a line of input and return a list of integers.

    #The program returns a list of results from `func_7()` called `rows` times, where each result corresponds to the output of `func_7()` for each of the `rows` test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` takes a positive integer `rows` as input, representing the number of test cases. It returns a list containing the results of calling `func_7()` `rows` times, with each result corresponding to the output of `func_7()` for each test case.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_9` does not have any parameters, so there are no variables to describe in terms of preconditions.

    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` across all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` calculates and returns a rank value for a given integer `da` based on the structure of the dictionary `d` and the list `processing`. If the list associated with `da` in `d` contains only one element, it returns 1. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the minimum rank value for each element in the list associated with `da`, updates the `rank` list with this value incremented by 1 for the index `da - 1`, and returns this incremented value.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers where b is not necessarily greater than a.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` (where `b` is not necessarily greater than `a`). It returns three values: in the case where `b` is 0, it returns 1, 0, and `a`. Otherwise, it returns values `y`, `x - a // b * y`, and `g`, which are derived through recursive computation, likely related to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.

#Function 14:

    #State: a is a list of integers, n and m are positive integers such that 0 <= n <= len(a) and m is a positive integer, k is an integer decremented by the sum of (m - a[i]) for all i in range(n) where a[i] < m.
    if (k >= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: a is a list of integers, n and m are positive integers such that 0 <= n <= len(a) and m is a positive integer, k is an integer decremented by the sum of (m - a[i]) for all i in range(n) where a[i] < m, and k is less than 0
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts a list of integers `a`, and two positive integers `n` and `m` such that 0 <= n <= len(a), and another integer `k`. It returns 1 if the integer `k` is non-negative after being decremented by the sum of `(m - a[i])` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)` where `a[i]` is less than `m`. Otherwise, it returns -1.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_15():
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: the final value of `ans` after all iterations.
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the final value of `ans` minus 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters. It calculates a value based on the integers `n` and `m` returned by `func_7`, and returns a computed result which is the final value of `ans` minus 1.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: The loop has printed the number 1, m times, each on a new line.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` prints the number 1, `m` times, each on a new line.
