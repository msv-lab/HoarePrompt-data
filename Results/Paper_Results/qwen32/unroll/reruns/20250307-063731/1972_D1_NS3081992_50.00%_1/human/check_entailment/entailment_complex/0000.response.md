Reasoning:  
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_15` is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs (a, b) for given n and m based on the conditions provided in the problem statement. However, the implementation of `func_15` does not follow the logic required to solve the problem.

The condition given in the problem is that `a + b` should be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. This means that `(a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0` should hold true. The provided `func_15` function does not implement this logic; instead, it performs a different calculation involving a loop and integer division, which is unrelated to the problem's requirements.

Furthermore, `func_16` is supposed to handle multiple test cases, but it repeatedly calls `func_15` and prints the result, which is incorrect since `func_15` does not correctly compute the number of valid pairs for each test case.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
