To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which includes the underscore `_` and the function call `func_10()`.

The loop will execute if `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0. The underscore `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's execution. Therefore, the only state we need to adjust is the return value of `func_10()`.

Given that `func_10()` is a function call, we cannot directly modify its return value in the provided state. However, we can assume that `func_10()` will return a value that determines whether the loop executes. For the loop to execute at least once, `func_10()` must return a positive integer.

Thus, the state needs to ensure that `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, and `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0**
