Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The main function responsible for calculating the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` is `func_15()`. However, this function does not properly check the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

The function `func_15()` uses a loop that iterates up to the square root of `n + i` and counts the number of valid pairs based on a different logic that does not match the problem's requirements.

Here is a counterexample:
For `n = 10` and `m = 8`, the correct number of valid pairs is 14 as per the problem statement. However, the provided function `func_15()` does not correctly compute this value.

Let's verify this with a simple example:
- For `(a, b) = (1, 1)`, `a + b = 2` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1`, which is a multiple of 1.
- For `(a, b) = (2, 1)`, `a + b = 3` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1`, which is a multiple of 1.
- For `(a, b) = (2, 2)`, `a + b = 4` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 2`, which is a multiple of 2.
- For `(a, b) = (3, 1)`, `a + b = 4` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1`, which is a multiple of 1.
- For `(a, b) = (4, 1)`, `a + b = 5` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1`, which is a multiple of 1.
- For `(a, b) = (5, 1)`, `a + b = 6` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1`, which is a multiple of 1.
- For `(a, b) = (6, 1)`, `a + b = 7` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1`, which is a multiple of 1.
- For `(a, b) = (6, 2)`, `a + b = 8` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 2`, which is a multiple of 2.
- For `(a, b) = (6, 3)`, `a + b = 9` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 3`, which is a multiple of 3.
- For `(a, b) = (7, 1)`, `a + b = 8` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1`, which is a multiple of 1.
- For `(a, b) = (8, 1)`, `a + b = 9` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1`, which is a multiple of 1.
- For `(a, b) = (9, 1)`, `a + b = 10` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1`, which is a multiple of 1.
- For `(a, b) = (10, 1)`, `a + b = 11` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1`, which is a multiple of 1.
- For `(a, b) = (10, 2)`, `a + b = 12` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 2`, which is a multiple of 2.

The function `func_15()` does not account for these valid pairs correctly, hence the program is incorrect.
