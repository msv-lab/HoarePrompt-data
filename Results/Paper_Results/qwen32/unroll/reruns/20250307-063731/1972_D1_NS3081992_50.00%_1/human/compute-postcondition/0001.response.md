To determine the output state, we need to understand the behavior of the functions `func_10()` and `func_15()` within the loop. However, since the definitions of `func_10()` and `func_15()` are not provided, I'll make some reasonable assumptions based on common usage in such scenarios:

1. `func_10()`: This function likely returns the number of iterations the loop should perform. Given the context, it might return `m` or `n`, or some value based on these variables.
2. `func_15()`: This function likely returns the value to be printed in each iteration. It could return a constant value, a value based on the loop iteration, or a value based on `n` or `m`.

Without specific definitions, let's assume:
- `func_10()` returns `m`, meaning the loop will execute `m` times.
- `func_15()` returns a constant value, say `1`, for each iteration.

Given these assumptions, the loop will print the number `1` a total of `m` times.

Thus, the output state after the loop finishes executing all iterations would be:

Output State: **The loop has printed the number 1, m times, each on a new line.**
