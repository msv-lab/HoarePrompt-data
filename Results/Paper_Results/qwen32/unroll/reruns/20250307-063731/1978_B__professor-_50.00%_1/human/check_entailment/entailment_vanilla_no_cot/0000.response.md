Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum profit for all possible values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. Let's break down the logic and identify the issues:

1. **Case `b <= a`:** The program correctly computes the profit as `n * a` because selling all buns at the usual price is better than the modified price.
   
2. **Case `b - a >= n`:** The program computes the profit using the formula `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`. This formula calculates the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - n + 1`. However, this is not always correct. The correct approach should consider the sum of the series from `b` down to `b - n + 1`, which is `int((b + (b - n + 1)) * n / 2)`. This is equivalent to the formula used in the program, but the condition `b - a >= n` is not the correct condition to use this formula.

3. **Case `b - a < n`:** The program uses the formula `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`. This formula is incorrect because it does not properly account for the maximum number of buns (`k`) that should be sold at the modified price to maximize profit. It should find the `k` that maximizes the profit, which involves calculating the profit for different values of `k` and choosing the maximum.

To fix the program, we need to compute the profit for different values of `k` and choose the maximum. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(min(n, b - a + 1) + 1):
            profit = sum(b - i for i in range(k)) + a * (n - k)
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        print(max_profit)

func()
```

However, this approach is inefficient for large `n` and `b`. A more efficient solution involves using the properties of arithmetic series and binary search to find the optimal `k` without iterating through all possible values. Here's an optimized version:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            # Calculate the maximum k where the modified price is better than the usual price
            k = min(n, b - a + 1)
            # Calculate the profit for this k
            profit = (b + b - k + 1) * k // 2 + a * (n - k)
            print(profit)

func()
```

This optimized version correctly computes the maximum profit by considering the correct range for `k` and using the arithmetic series sum formula efficiently.
