You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17

    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))
        
    #State: `t` is unchanged, and `n`, `a`, and `b` are not defined after the loop as they are overwritten in each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it computes and prints a specific value based on the relationship between `a` and `b` relative to `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic used to calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns under the given promotions.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Promotion:**
   - Bob can choose an integer \( k \) (0 \(\leq\) k \(\leq\) min(n, b)).
   - The first \( k \) buns are sold at a price that decreases by 1 coin for each subsequent bun: i-th bun is sold for \( (b - i + 1) \) coins.
   - The remaining \( (n - k) \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \) coins each.

2. **Objective:**
   - Determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by choosing the optimal \( k \).

3. **Logic in the Program:**
   - **Case 1:** If \( b \leq a \)
     - Selling at the modified price does not offer any advantage over the usual price.
     - Therefore, it's optimal to sell all buns at the usual price.
     - Profit = \( n \times a \).
   - **Case 2:** If \( b - a \geq n \)
     - The profit from selling the first \( n \) buns at the modified price is higher than selling them at the usual price.
     - Therefore, it's optimal to sell all \( n \) buns at the modified price.
     - Profit = Sum of an arithmetic series: \( \frac{(2b - n + 1) \times n}{2} \).
   - **Case 3:** If \( b - a < n \)
     - The profit from selling the first \( b - a \) buns at the modified price is higher than selling them at the usual price.
     - The remaining \( n - (b - a) \) buns are sold at the usual price.
     - Profit = Sum of the first \( b - a \) terms of the modified price series + remaining buns at usual price.
     - Profit = \( \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n \).

4. **Verification:**
   - The given program correctly implements the above logic.
   - The formula for the sum of the arithmetic series is correctly applied in each case.
   - The program handles all edge cases, including when \( b \leq a \) and when \( b - a \geq n \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum profit for each test case based on the given conditions and formulas.
