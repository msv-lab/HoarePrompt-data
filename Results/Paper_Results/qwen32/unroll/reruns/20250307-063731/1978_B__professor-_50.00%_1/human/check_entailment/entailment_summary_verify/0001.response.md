To verify the correctness of the given program, let's carefully analyze the logic and the function summary, and compare it with the problem description and the provided test cases.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Promotion:**
   - Bob can choose an integer \( k \) (0 \(\leq\) k \(\leq\) min(n, b)).
   - The first \( k \) buns are sold at a price that decreases by 1 coin for each subsequent bun: i-th bun is sold for \( (b - i + 1) \) coins.
   - The remaining \( (n - k) \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \) coins each.

2. **Objective:**
   - Determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by choosing the optimal \( k \).

3. **Logic in the Program:**
   - **Case 1:** If \( b \leq a \)
     - Selling at the modified price does not offer any advantage over the usual price.
     - Therefore, it's optimal to sell all buns at the usual price.
     - Profit = \( n \times a \).
   - **Case 2:** If \( b - a \geq n \)
     - The profit from selling the first \( n \) buns at the modified price is higher than selling them at the usual price.
     - Therefore, it's optimal to sell all \( n \) buns at the modified price.
     - Profit = Sum of an arithmetic series: \( \frac{(2b - n + 1) \times n}{2} \).
   - **Case 3:** If \( b - a < n \)
     - The profit from selling the first \( b - a \) buns at the modified price is higher than selling them at the usual price.
     - The remaining \( n - (b - a) \) buns are sold at the usual price.
     - Profit = Sum of the first \( b - a \) terms of the modified price series + remaining buns at usual price.
     - Profit = \( \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n \).

4. **Verification:**
   - **Case 1:** If \( b \leq a \), the program correctly calculates \( n \times a \).
   - **Case 2:** If \( b - a \geq n \), the program correctly calculates the sum of the arithmetic series \( \frac{(2b - n + 1) \times n}{2} \).
   - **Case 3:** If \( b - a < n \), the program calculates \( \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n \).

However, there is an issue in the calculation for **Case 3**. The correct formula should be the sum of the first \( b - a \) terms of the modified price series, which is \( \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} \), plus the profit from selling the remaining \( n - (b - a) \) buns at the usual price \( a \times (n - (b - a)) \).

The correct formula for **Case 3** should be:
\[ \text{Profit} = \sum_{i=1}^{b-a} (b - i + 1) + a \times (n - (b - a)) \]
\[ \text{Profit} = \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times (n - (b - a)) \]

The original program incorrectly calculates the profit for **Case 3** as:
\[ \text{Profit} = \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n \]

### Correct Formula for Case 3:
The correct formula for **Case 3** should be:
\[ \text{Profit} = \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times (n - (b - a)) \]

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            k = b - a
            print(int((k * (k + 1) / 2) + a * (n - k)))
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the mistake in the calculation for **Case 3**. The profit calculation for **Case 3** should account for the remaining buns sold at the usual price correctly.

Final: **False**
