To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic used to calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns under the given promotions.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Promotion:**
   - Bob can choose an integer \( k \) (0 \(\leq\) k \(\leq\) min(n, b)).
   - The first \( k \) buns are sold at a price that decreases by 1 coin for each subsequent bun: i-th bun is sold for \( (b - i + 1) \) coins.
   - The remaining \( (n - k) \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \) coins each.

2. **Objective:**
   - Determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by choosing the optimal \( k \).

3. **Logic in the Program:**
   - **Case 1:** If \( b \leq a \)
     - Selling at the modified price does not offer any advantage over the usual price.
     - Therefore, it's optimal to sell all buns at the usual price.
     - Profit = \( n \times a \).
   - **Case 2:** If \( b - a \geq n \)
     - The profit from selling the first \( n \) buns at the modified price is higher than selling them at the usual price.
     - Therefore, it's optimal to sell all \( n \) buns at the modified price.
     - Profit = Sum of an arithmetic series: \( \frac{(2b - n + 1) \times n}{2} \).
   - **Case 3:** If \( b - a < n \)
     - The profit from selling the first \( b - a \) buns at the modified price is higher than selling them at the usual price.
     - The remaining \( n - (b - a) \) buns are sold at the usual price.
     - Profit = Sum of the first \( b - a \) terms of the modified price series + remaining buns at usual price.
     - Profit = \( \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n \).

4. **Verification:**
   - The given program correctly implements the above logic.
   - The formula for the sum of the arithmetic series is correctly applied in each case.
   - The program handles all edge cases, including when \( b \leq a \) and when \( b - a \geq n \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum profit for each test case based on the given conditions and formulas.

Correctness: **True**
