To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand the effect of each iteration on the variables and the output. The loop processes `t` sets of inputs, where for each set, it calculates and prints a value based on the conditions involving `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Here's the breakdown of the loop:

1. **Initialization**: The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. **Input**: For each iteration, the user provides three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. **Logic**:
   - If `b <= a`, the output is `n * a`.
   - If `b - a >= n`, the output is calculated as `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`.
   - Otherwise (i.e., `b - a < n`), the output is calculated as `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`.

The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are modified within the loop, but after the loop finishes, the only variable that retains its value from the initial state is `t` itself, as it is used to control the loop. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are overwritten in each iteration and do not retain their values after the loop.

The output of the loop is a series of printed values, one for each iteration. Since the loop does not modify `t` and the other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`) are only used within the loop and do not persist after it, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `n`, `a`, and `b` do not retain specific values as they are overwritten in each iteration of the loop. The loop prints a series of values based on the conditions provided.**

However, since the problem asks for the state of the variables after the loop, and `n`, `a`, and `b` do not retain specific values, we can describe the state as:

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, and `n`, `a`, and `b` are not defined after the loop as they are overwritten in each iteration.**
