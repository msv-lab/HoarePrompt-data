The code snippet provided is `t = int(input())`. This line of code takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. After executing the code, the value of `t` will be the integer input provided by the user, and it will still satisfy the condition 1 <= t <= 10^4. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.**
