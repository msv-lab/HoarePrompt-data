The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in Python for iteration and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
