### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to verify if it correctly computes the MEX of the array `c` after both Alice and Bob play optimally.

1. **Understanding the Optimal Strategy:**
   - **Alice's Goal:** Maximize the MEX of the final array `c`.
   - **Bob's Goal:** Minimize the MEX of the final array `c`.
   - **Optimal Play:**
     - Alice will try to add elements to `c` such that the MEX is maximized.
     - Bob will try to prevent Alice from achieving this by removing elements that Alice might want to add.

2. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
   - If there are at least two elements that appear exactly once in the array `a`, Alice can ensure that the MEX is at least 2 by adding one of these elements to `c` on her first turn. Bob can only remove one of them, leaving at least one for Alice to use.
   - If no element appears exactly once, the MEX will be the smallest integer not present in `a`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program counts the occurrences of each element in the array `a` using a dictionary `cnt`.
   - It then iterates through the possible values from 0 to `N-1` and checks:
     - If there are at least two elements that appear exactly once (`t >= 2`), it prints the current index `i` and breaks.
     - If the current index `i` does not appear in `a` (`cnt[i] == 0`), it also prints `i` and breaks.
   - This logic correctly identifies the smallest index `i` such that either there are at least two elements in the list that appear exactly once, or the element `i` does not appear in the list, which is the MEX of the final array `c` after optimal play by both Alice and Bob.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the final array `c` after both players play optimally. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
