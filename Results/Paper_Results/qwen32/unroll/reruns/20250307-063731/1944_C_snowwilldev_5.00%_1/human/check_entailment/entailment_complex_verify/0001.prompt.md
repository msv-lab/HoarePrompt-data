You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a list of n integers a where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
        t = 0
        
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break
        
    #State: Each test case has printed its respective output value, and no changes are made to the global state variables outside the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it determines and prints the smallest index `i` such that either there are at least two elements in the list that appear exactly once, or the element `i` does not appear in the list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a` and appending them to `c` (Alice) or just deleting them (Bob). Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c` while Bob wants to minimize it.
2. **MEX**: The smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.
3. **Optimal Play**: Both players play optimally, meaning they make the best moves to achieve their goals.
4. **Game Dynamics**:
   - Alice appends elements to `c`.
   - Bob deletes elements from `a` without appending them to `c`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
5. **Key Insight**: The final MEX of `c` depends on the elements Alice chooses and the elements Bob deletes. The optimal strategy involves Alice trying to include as many unique small integers as possible in `c` while Bob tries to prevent this.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to determine the final MEX of `c` by analyzing the counts of each element in `a`:
1. **Count Elements**: It uses a `defaultdict` to count occurrences of each element in `a`.
2. **Determine MEX**: It iterates through the possible values from 0 to `N-1` and checks:
   - If the count of the current value is 1 (`cnt[i] == 1`), it increments a counter `t`.
   - If `t` reaches 2 or the count of the current value is 0 (`cnt[i] == 0`), it prints the current value `i` and breaks the loop.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program's logic is flawed because it doesn't correctly simulate the optimal play of both players.
- The program assumes that the MEX can be determined solely based on the counts of elements, without considering the strategic moves by Alice and Bob.
- **Example Counterexample**:
  - Consider the input `4 0 0 1 1`. The program might output `2`, but the correct output is `2` because Alice can strategically pick `1` and `0` in such a way that the MEX of `c` is `2`, regardless of Bob's moves.
  - However, the program does not simulate the game's dynamics and instead relies on a flawed counting mechanism.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly simulate the game's dynamics and does not account for the optimal strategies of both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
