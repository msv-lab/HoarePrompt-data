Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases for the game between Alice and Bob. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Handling of Unique Elements:**
   - The program increments `t` only when an element appears exactly once in the array. However, this logic is insufficient to determine the MEX correctly.
   
2. **Break Condition:**
   - The loop breaks when `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`. This condition is not correctly determining the MEX. Specifically, the condition `t >= 2` is not relevant to finding the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array `c`.

3. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array `c`. The provided program does not correctly simulate the game and determine the final array `c` after both players have made their optimal moves.

Let's consider a counterexample:

**Counterexample:**

Input:
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```

Expected Output:
```
5
```

Explanation:
- Alice and Bob will take turns picking elements from the array. Since the array already contains all integers from 0 to 4, the final array `c` will be `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` (the order does not matter). The MEX of this array is 5.

However, the provided program will output `0` for this input, which is incorrect.

**Another Counterexample:**

Input:
```
1
4
0 1 1 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Explanation:
- Alice and Bob will take turns picking elements. The optimal strategy for Alice is to pick `1` first, then `0`, and so on. The final array `c` could be `[1, 1, 1, 0]` or any permutation of it. The MEX of this array is 2.

The provided program will output `0` for this input as well, which is incorrect.

Given these counterexamples, the program does not correctly determine the MEX for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
