You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program: 
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        t = 0

- Annotated Code: 
from collections import defaultdict

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a list of n integers a where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
        t = 0
        
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break
        
    #State: Each test case has printed its respective output value, and no changes are made to the global state variables outside the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it determines and prints the smallest index `i` such that either there are at least two elements in the list that appear exactly once, or the element `i` does not appear in the list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases for the game between Alice and Bob. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Handling of Unique Elements:**
   - The program increments `t` only when an element appears exactly once in the array. However, this logic is insufficient to determine the MEX correctly.
   
2. **Break Condition:**
   - The loop breaks when `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`. This condition is not correctly determining the MEX. Specifically, the condition `t >= 2` is not relevant to finding the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array `c`.

3. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array `c`. The provided program does not correctly simulate the game and determine the final array `c` after both players have made their optimal moves.

Let's consider a counterexample:

**Counterexample:**

Input:
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```

Expected Output:
```
5
```

Explanation:
- Alice and Bob will take turns picking elements from the array. Since the array already contains all integers from 0 to 4, the final array `c` will be `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` (the order does not matter). The MEX of this array is 5.

However, the provided program will output `0` for this input, which is incorrect.

**Another Counterexample:**

Input:
```
1
4
0 1 1 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Explanation:
- Alice and Bob will take turns picking elements. The optimal strategy for Alice is to pick `1` first, then `0`, and so on. The final array `c` could be `[1, 1, 1, 0]` or any permutation of it. The MEX of this array is 2.

The provided program will output `0` for this input as well, which is incorrect.

Given these counterexamples, the program does not correctly determine the MEX for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
