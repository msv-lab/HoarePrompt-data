### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic behind the code and compare it with the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob to achieve the game's score, which is the MEX of the array `c`.

1. **Understanding the Game and MEX:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Game Strategy:**
   - Alice will always pick an element that helps in increasing the MEX of `c`. Ideally, she will pick elements that are not already in `c` or are present only once.
   - Bob will pick elements that prevent Alice from achieving a higher MEX. He will try to pick elements that Alice would have picked to maximize MEX.

3. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - Alice should try to pick elements that are not present in `c` or are present only once, as these elements will help in increasing the MEX.
   - Bob will pick any element, but he will try to maximize the number of elements that Alice cannot pick to increase the MEX.

4. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.
   - It iterates through the range from `0` to `N-1` and checks the count of each element.
   - If an element appears exactly once (`cnt[i] == 1`), it increments a counter `t`.
   - If `t` reaches at least 2 (meaning there are at least two unique elements that appear exactly once) or if an element does not appear at all (`cnt[i] == 0`), it prints `i` as the MEX and breaks the loop.
   - This logic is based on the observation that the first number with a count of 0 or the second number with a count of 1 will be the MEX after optimal play.

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **First Example:** `a = [0, 0, 1, 1]`
     - Counts: `cnt[0] = 2, cnt[1] = 2`
     - The first number with a count of 0 is `2`, so the MEX is `2`.
   - **Second Example:** `a = [0, 1, 2, 3]`
     - Counts: `cnt[0] = 1, cnt[1] = 1, cnt[2] = 1, cnt[3] = 1`
     - The first number with a count of 0 is `4`, but since `t` reaches 2 at `i = 1`, the MEX is `1`.
   - **Third Example:** `a = [1, 1]`
     - Counts: `cnt[0] = 0, cnt[1] = 2`
     - The first number with a count of 0 is `0`, so the MEX is `0`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX after optimal play by Alice and Bob. It efficiently counts the occurrences of each element and determines the MEX based on the conditions mentioned.

**Correctness: True**
