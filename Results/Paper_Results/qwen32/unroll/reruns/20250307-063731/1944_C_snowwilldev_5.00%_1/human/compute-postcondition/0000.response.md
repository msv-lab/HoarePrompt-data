To ensure that the for loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `tc` and the range it iterates over, which is `int(input())`. The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0 because `tc` will take on values from 0 up to, but not including, `int(input())`.

Given the state before the loop starts, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, which means `t` represents the number of test cases. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be equal to `t` and `t` must be greater than 0.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `tc` is 0, `int(input())` is equal to `t`**

However, since `int(input())` is not a variable we can directly set, we can represent the state in terms of `t` as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `tc` is 0**

This ensures that the loop will execute `t` times, as `t` is the number of test cases and `int(input())` will be `t`.
