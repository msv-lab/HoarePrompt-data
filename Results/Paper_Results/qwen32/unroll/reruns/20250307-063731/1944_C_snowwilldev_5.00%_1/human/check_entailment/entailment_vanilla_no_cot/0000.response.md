To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it correctly computes the game's score as defined by the problem statement. The program aims to find the MEX of the array `c` after both Alice and Bob have played optimally.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Handling:** The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Counting Elements:** It uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.

3. **Determining the MEX:** The program iterates through numbers from 0 to `N-1`:
   - It increments a counter `t` for each number that appears exactly once in `a`.
   - If `t` reaches 2 (indicating that there are at least two numbers that appear exactly once) or if the current number `i` does not appear in `a` (i.e., `cnt[i] == 0`), it prints `i` as the MEX and breaks out of the loop.

The logic of the program is flawed for several reasons:

- **Optimal Play:** The program does not simulate the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. It simply counts the occurrences of each number and determines the MEX based on the counts, which does not account for the strategic choices of the players.

- **MEX Calculation:** The program does not correctly simulate the game process. It assumes that the MEX can be determined solely based on the count of single occurrences and the presence of numbers in the array, which is not necessarily true under optimal play.

- **Edge Cases:** The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, if all numbers from 0 to `N-1` appear an even number of times, the MEX should be `N`, but the program does not account for this scenario.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the game where Alice and Bob make optimal choices. Alice will try to maximize the MEX, while Bob will try to minimize it. The correct approach involves using a greedy strategy or dynamic programming to simulate the game and determine the final MEX.

Given the above analysis, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
