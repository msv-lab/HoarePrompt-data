To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze the logic and compare it with the problem description and the provided examples.

### Analysis of the Program:
The given program is designed to solve the problem by analyzing the conditions under which Sasha can guarantee to have any number of coins `n` by placing bets in the casino.

The program checks three different cases based on the relationship between `k` and `x`:

1. **Case 1: \( x < k - 1 \)**
   - Here, the program checks if Sasha has at least \( x + 1 \) coins. If he does, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

2. **Case 2: \( x == k - 1 \)**
   - Here, the program checks if Sasha has at least \( x + 2 \) coins. If he does, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Case 3: \( x > k - 1 \)**
   - Here, the program calculates a value `z` starting from \( k - 2 \) and iteratively updates it for \( x - k + 2 \) times. In each iteration, `z` is updated as \( z = z + \left\lfloor \frac{z}{k-1} \right\rfloor + 1 \). If the final value of `z` is less than or equal to Sasha's initial coins `a`, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Verification with the Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case: \( k = 2, x = 1, a = 7 \)**
   - Since \( x < k - 1 \) is false and \( x == k - 1 \) is true, it checks if \( a \geq x + 2 \) which is \( 7 \geq 3 \). This is true, so it prints "YES".

2. **Second Test Case: \( k = 2, x = 1, a = 1 \)**
   - Since \( x < k - 1 \) is false and \( x == k - 1 \) is true, it checks if \( a \geq x + 2 \) which is \( 1 \geq 3 \). This is false, so it prints "NO".

3. **Third Test Case: \( k = 2, x = 3, a = 15 \)**
   - Since \( x > k - 1 \) is true, it calculates `z` as follows:
     - Initial `z = k - 2 = 0`
     - Iteration 1: \( z = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 \)
     - Iteration 2: \( z = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 \)
     - Iteration 3: \( z = 2 + 0 + 1 = 3 \)
   - Final `z = 3` and \( a = 15 \geq 3 \), so it prints "YES".

4. **Fourth Test Case: \( k = 3, x = 3, a = 6 \)**
   - Since \( x == k - 1 \) is true, it checks if \( a \geq x + 2 \) which is \( 6 \geq 5 \). This is true, so it prints "NO" (but the correct answer should be "YES" based on the problem statement, indicating a mistake in the program).

5. **Fifth Test Case: \( k = 4, x = 4, a = 5 \)**
   - Since \( x == k - 1 \) is false and \( x > k - 1 \) is true, it calculates `z` as follows:
     - Initial `z = k - 2 = 2`
     - Iteration 1: \( z = 2 + 0 + 1 = 3 \)
     - Final `z = 3` and \( a = 5 \geq 3 \), so it prints "NO".

6. **Sixth Test Case: \( k = 5, x = 4, a = 7 \)**
   - Since \( x > k - 1 \) is true, it calculates `z` as follows:
     - Initial `z = k - 2 = 3`
     - Iteration 1: \( z = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 \)
     - Final `z = 5` and \( a = 7 \geq 5 \), so it prints "YES".

7. **Seventh Test Case: \( k = 4, x = 88, a = 1000000000 \)**
   - Since \( x > k - 1 \) is true, it calculates `z` as follows:
     - Initial `z = k - 2 = 2`
     - Iteration 1: \( z = 2 + 0 + 1 = 3 \)
     - Iteration 2: \( z = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 \)
     - Iteration 3: \( z = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8 \)
     - Iteration 4: \( z = 8 + 4 + 1 = 13 \)
     - Iteration 5: \( z = 13 + 6 + 1 = 20 \)
     - Iteration 6: \( z = 20 + 13 + 1 = 34 \)
     - Iteration 7: \( z = 34 + 22 + 1 = 57 \)
     - Iteration 8: \( z = 57 + 38 + 1 = 96 \)
     - Iteration 9: \( z = 96 + 64 + 1 = 161 \)
     - Iteration 10: \( z = 161 + 107 + 1 = 269 \)
     - Iteration 11: \( z = 269 + 179 + 1 = 449 \)
     - Iteration 12: \( z = 449 + 299 + 1 = 749 \)
     - Iteration 13: \( z = 749 + 499 + 1 = 1249 \)
     - Iteration 14: \( z = 1249 + 832 + 1 = 2082 \)
     - Iteration 15: \( z = 2082 + 1388 + 1 = 3471 \)
     - Iteration 16: \( z = 3471 + 2314 + 1 = 5786 \)
     - Iteration 17: \( z = 5786 + 3857 + 1 = 9644 \)
     - Iteration 18: \( z = 9644 + 6429 + 1 = 16074 \)
     - Iteration 19: \( z = 16074 + 10716 + 1 = 26791 \)
     - Iteration 20: \( z = 26791 + 17860 + 1 = 44652 \)
     - Iteration 21: \( z = 44652 + 29768 + 1 = 74421 \)
     - Iteration 22: \( z = 74421 + 49614 + 1 = 124036 \)
     - Iteration 23: \( z = 124036 + 82690 + 1 = 206727 \)
     - Iteration 24: \( z = 206727 + 137818 + 1 = 344546 \)
     - Iteration 25: \( z = 344546 + 229697 + 1 = 574244 \)
     - Iteration 26: \( z = 574244 + 382829 + 1 = 957074 \)
     - Iteration 27: \( z = 957074 + 635249 + 1 = 1592324 \)
     - Iteration 28: \( z = 1592324 + 1061549 + 1 = 2653874 \)
     - Iteration 29: \( z = 2653874 + 1769049 + 1 = 4422924 \)
     - Iteration 30: \( z = 4422924 + 2948616
