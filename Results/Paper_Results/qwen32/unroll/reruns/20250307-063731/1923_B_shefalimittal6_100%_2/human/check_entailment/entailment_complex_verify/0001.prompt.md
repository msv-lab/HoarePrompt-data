You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine whether we can kill all monsters before they reach the character at position 0 on a straight line. We can fire up to `k` bullets each second, and each bullet can decrease the health of one monster by 1. After firing, any monster with health 0 or less dies, and all remaining monsters move one step closer to the character.

### Key Points:
1. **Order of Targeting Monsters**: The program sorts the monsters based on their distance from the character (absolute value of their positions). This ensures that we target the closest monsters first, which is a logical strategy to prevent any monster from reaching the character.
2. **Firing Bullets**: The program uses a while loop to simulate each second. It fires up to `k` bullets on each iteration, targeting monsters in order of their distance from the character. If a monster's health reaches 0, it is removed from the list of targets.
3. **Checking for Loss Condition**: After firing bullets and decreasing the health of the targeted monsters, the program checks if any monster has reached the character (position 0). If so, it returns `False` (indicating a loss).
4. **Monster Movement**: After firing and checking, the program increments the `distance` variable, which represents the number of seconds that have passed. This implicitly simulates the movement of the monsters one step closer to the character at the end of each second.

### Program Analysis:
- **Sorting**: The program sorts the indices of the monsters based on their distance from the character. This is a good strategy because it ensures that we target the closest monsters first, which is crucial for preventing any monster from reaching the character.
- **Firing Bullets**: The program uses a nested while loop to fire up to `k` bullets each second. It decreases the health of the targeted monsters and removes them from the list once their health reaches 0.
- **Checking for Loss**: The program checks if any monster has reached the character (position 0) at the beginning of each second. If a monster is at position 0, it returns `False` immediately, indicating a loss.
- **Monster Movement**: The program increments the `distance` variable at the end of each second, which implicitly simulates the movement of the monsters one step closer to the character.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly simulate the game mechanics and determine whether the character can survive and kill all monsters before any of them reach the character. The sorting of monsters based on their distance from the character ensures that we target the closest monsters first, which is a logical strategy. The program also correctly checks for the loss condition and simulates the movement of the monsters.
