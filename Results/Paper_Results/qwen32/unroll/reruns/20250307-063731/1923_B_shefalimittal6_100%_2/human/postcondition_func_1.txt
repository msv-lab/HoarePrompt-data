The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers representing the health of monsters, a list of integers representing their initial positions, and an integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second. For each test case, it determines if it is possible to defeat all monsters and prints 'YES' if possible, otherwise 'NO'.
