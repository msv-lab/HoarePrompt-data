### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to determine if you can survive and kill all the monsters before any of them reach your character at position 0.
   - You can shoot up to `k` bullets per second, each bullet decreasing the health of a targeted monster by 1.
   - After shooting, any monster with health 0 or less dies.
   - Then, all remaining monsters move one position closer to you.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes three arguments: `a` (list of healths of monsters), `x` (list of initial positions of monsters), and `k` (maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second).
   - It sorts the indices of the monsters based on their distance from the character (using `abs(x[i])`).
   - It then iterates through the sorted indices, checking if the monsters can be killed before they reach the character.
   - For each distance, it tries to kill as many monsters as possible using up to `k` bullets.
   - If at any point a monster reaches the character (i.e., `abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance`), it returns `False`.
   - If all monsters are killed before reaching the character, it returns `True`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`.
   - It then calls `func_1` with these values and prints 'YES' if the result is `True` (indicating that it is possible to kill all monsters), otherwise it prints 'NO'.

4. **Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that the program checks whether the monsters can be killed before they reach the character by sorting them by their distance and shooting at them optimally.
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases and formats the output as required.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if all monsters can be killed before they reach the character. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
