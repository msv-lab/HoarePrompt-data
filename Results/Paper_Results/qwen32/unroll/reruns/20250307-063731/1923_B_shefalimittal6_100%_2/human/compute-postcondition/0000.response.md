Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the health of each monster, `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of each monster such that -n <= x_i < x_2 < ... < x_n <= n and x_i != 0, `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second, `t` is an input integer.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is set to the integer value provided by the input, while the values of `a`, `x`, and `k` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
