You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the main issue lies in the `func_1` function, which determines whether it's possible to kill all monsters before they reach the character.

### Problematic Logic in `func_1`:
1. **Distance Calculation and Monster Killing**:
   - The function sorts the monsters based on their absolute distance from the character.
   - It then iterates through the sorted list, attempting to kill monsters before they reach the character.
   - The key issue is the handling of the `distance` variable and the logic inside the while loop. The function increments the `distance` after processing all monsters at the current distance, but it does not correctly account for the fact that monsters can move closer during the same second.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Monster Movement**:
   - After firing bullets at monsters at the current `distance`, the function immediately increments the `distance` variable. This means that it does not consider the scenario where a monster that was at a greater distance could move closer and potentially reach the character in the same second.
   - For example, if there is a monster at distance 2 and another at distance 1, and you kill the monster at distance 1, the monster at distance 2 will move to distance 1 in the same second. The function does not account for this and might incorrectly conclude that the character is safe when, in reality, a monster could have reached the character.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
2 1
1 1
-1 2
```
- **Explanation**:
  - There are two monsters: one at position -1 with health 1 and another at position 2 with health 1.
  - In the first second, you can kill the monster at position -1.
  - However, the monster at position 2 will move to position 1 in the same second, and since you can only fire one bullet, you cannot kill the second monster in the first second.
  - In the second second, the monster at position 1 will reach the character, and you will lose.

### Correct Output:
For the above test case, the correct output should be `NO` because the character cannot survive and kill all monsters.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where monsters can move closer and potentially reach the character in the same second after some monsters are killed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
