### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to determine if the solution is correct.

#### Problem Breakdown:
- **Objective**: Determine if you can kill all monsters before any of them reach the character at position 0.
- **Constraints**:
  - Each second, you can fire up to `k` bullets at any monsters.
  - Each bullet decreases the health of the targeted monster by 1.
  - After shooting, any monster with health 0 or less dies.
  - All remaining monsters move one step closer to the character.
  - If any monster reaches the character (position 0), you lose.

#### Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1(a, x, k)`**:
  - **Purpose**: Determines if it's possible to kill all monsters given their health (`a`), positions (`x`), and the maximum number of bullets (`k`) that can be fired per second.
  - **Logic**:
    1. **Sorting**: The function first sorts the indices of the monsters based on their absolute positions (`abs(x[i])`).
    2. **Distance Handling**: It iterates through the sorted list of monsters and checks if any monster reaches the character (position 0) before it can be killed.
    3. **Bullet Allocation**: For each distance step, it allocates bullets to the monsters in such a way that it tries to kill as many monsters as possible before they move closer.
    4. **Termination**: The loop continues until all monsters are killed or a monster reaches the character.

- **Function `func_2()`**:
  - **Purpose**: Reads multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to determine if all monsters can be killed in each test case.
  - **Logic**:
    1. **Input Reading**: Reads the number of test cases (`t`).
    2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it reads the number of monsters (`n`), the maximum number of bullets (`k`), the health of the monsters (`a`), and their positions (`x`).
    3. **Result Output**: Calls `func_1` to determine if all monsters can be killed and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

#### Verification:
- **Sorting by Absolute Position**: Sorting the monsters by their absolute positions ensures that the function prioritizes monsters that are closer to the character, which is a logical strategy.
- **Distance Handling**: The function correctly checks if any monster reaches the character before it can be killed.
- **Bullet Allocation**: The function allocates bullets in a way that maximizes the number of monsters killed before they move closer, which is a greedy approach.
- **Termination**: The loop terminates when all monsters are killed or a monster reaches the character, ensuring the function correctly determines the result.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
