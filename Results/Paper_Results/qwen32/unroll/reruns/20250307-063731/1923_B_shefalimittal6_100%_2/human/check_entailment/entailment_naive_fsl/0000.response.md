Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the main issue lies in the `func_1` function, which determines whether it's possible to kill all monsters before they reach the character.

### Problematic Logic in `func_1`:
1. **Distance Calculation and Monster Killing**:
   - The function sorts the monsters based on their absolute distance from the character.
   - It then iterates through the sorted list, attempting to kill monsters before they reach the character.
   - The key issue is the handling of the `distance` variable and the logic inside the while loop. The function increments the `distance` after processing all monsters at the current distance, but it does not correctly account for the fact that monsters can move closer during the same second.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Monster Movement**:
   - After firing bullets at monsters at the current `distance`, the function immediately increments the `distance` variable. This means that it does not consider the scenario where a monster that was at a greater distance could move closer and potentially reach the character in the same second.
   - For example, if there is a monster at distance 2 and another at distance 1, and you kill the monster at distance 1, the monster at distance 2 will move to distance 1 in the same second. The function does not account for this and might incorrectly conclude that the character is safe when, in reality, a monster could have reached the character.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
2 1
1 1
-1 2
```
- **Explanation**:
  - There are two monsters: one at position -1 with health 1 and another at position 2 with health 1.
  - In the first second, you can kill the monster at position -1.
  - However, the monster at position 2 will move to position 1 in the same second, and since you can only fire one bullet, you cannot kill the second monster in the first second.
  - In the second second, the monster at position 1 will reach the character, and you will lose.

### Correct Output:
For the above test case, the correct output should be `NO` because the character cannot survive and kill all monsters.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where monsters can move closer and potentially reach the character in the same second after some monsters are killed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
