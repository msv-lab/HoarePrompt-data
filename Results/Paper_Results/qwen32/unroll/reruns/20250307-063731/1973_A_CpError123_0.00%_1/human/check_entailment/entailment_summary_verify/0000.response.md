Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Analysis

1. **Total Points and Matches Calculation:**
   - The total points across all games is `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`.
   - Since each game results in a total of 2 points (either 2 for a win and 0 for a loss, or 1 for each in a draw), the total number of games played is `total_matchs = total_points // 2`.

2. **Checking for Validity:**
   - If `total_points` is odd, it's impossible to have a valid set of games, so the code correctly returns `-1`.
   - The code checks if `total_matchs > 3` or `p3 > total_matchs`. However, `total_matchs > 3` is not necessarily invalid because more than 3 games can be played. The check `p3 > total_matchs` is also incorrect because `p3` can be less than `total_matchs` in valid scenarios.

3. **Calculating Draws:**
   - The formula used for `egalites` is:
     ```python
     egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
     ```
     This formula is intended to subtract the points from wins and leave the points from draws. However, this formula can lead to negative values, which are incorrect.

### Issues in the Code
- The formula for `egalites` is incorrect and can lead to negative values.
- The condition `total_matchs > 3` is too restrictive.
- The condition `p3 > total_matchs` is incorrect.

### Correct Approach
To correctly calculate the maximum number of draws, we need to consider the following:
- The maximum number of draws is the minimum of the differences between the scores and the remaining points after accounting for the wins.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        # Calculate the minimum of the differences and the remaining points
        max_draws = min(p3 - p2, p3 - p1, total_matchs - (p3 - p2))
        if 2 * (p3 - p2) + 2 * (p3 - p1) > total_points:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(max_draws)
    return resultats
```

### Verification with Provided Test Cases
Let's verify the original code with the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case (0, 0, 0):**
   - `total_points = 0`, `total_matchs = 0`
   - No games were played, so the number of draws is `0`.

2. **Test Case (0, 1, 1):**
   - `total_points = 2`, `total_matchs = 1`
   - One draw occurred, so the number of draws is `1`.

3. **Test Case (1, 1, 1):**
   - `total_points = 3`, which is odd, so the number of draws is `-1`.

4. **Test Case (1, 1, 2):**
   - `total_points = 4`, `total_matchs = 2`
   - Two games were played, and the maximum number of draws is `2`.

5. **Test Case (3, 3, 3):**
   - `total_points = 9`, which is odd, so the number of draws is `-1`.

6. **Test Case (3, 4, 5):**
   - `total_points = 12`, `total_matchs = 6`
   - The maximum number of draws is `6`.

7. **Test Case (1, 1, 10):**
   - `total_points = 12`, `total_matchs = 6`
   - The maximum number of draws is `2`.

The original code fails on the test case `(1, 1, 2)` because it incorrectly calculates `egalites` as `-2`, leading to an incorrect result of `-1`.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is correct. The provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly the test case `(1, 1, 2)`, which demonstrates the issue.

Final: **False**
