### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the original assessment to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Key Points of the Problem Description:
1. **Points Distribution:** 
   - A win gives 2 points to the winner.
   - A draw gives 1 point to each player.
   - Total points should be even because each game contributes 2 points.
   
2. **Constraints:**
   - \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\)
   - The total number of matches cannot exceed 3 (since each match involves two players out of three).

3. **Objective:**
   - Find the maximum number of draws, or return -1 if the scores are inconsistent.

#### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Total Points Check:**
   - The program correctly checks if the total points are even. If not, it returns `-1`.
   
2. **Total Matches Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the total number of matches as `total_points // 2`.
   - It checks if `total_matchs` is greater than 3. This condition is correct because no more than 3 matches can be played among 3 players.
   - It checks if `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`. This condition is correct because a player cannot have more wins than the total number of matches.

3. **Calculating Draws:**
   - The program calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - The formula aims to account for the points contributed by wins and then the remaining points should be due to draws.
   - The program checks if `egalites` is negative and returns `-1` if so, which is correct.
   - It then calculates the number of draws as `egalites // 2`.

#### Issues Identified:
- **Case (0, 2, 3):** The program correctly identifies that the total points are odd and returns `-1`.
- **Case (3, 3, 3):** The program correctly identifies that the total points are odd and returns `-1`.
- **Case (0, 0, 6):** The program incorrectly calculates the number of draws as `3`. The expected output is `2`. Let's verify:
  - Total points: 6 (even)
  - Total matches: 3
  - Draws calculation:
    - `egalites = 6 - 2 * (3 - 3) - 2 * (3 - 0) = 6 - 0 - 6 = 0`
    - `egalites // 2 = 0 // 2 = 0`
  - The program should return `0` for draws, not `3`. This indicates an error in the logic or the example output.

#### Correctness:
- The original assessment identifies issues with the program's handling of the draws calculation, specifically for the case (0, 0, 6). The program does not correctly calculate the number of draws in this case.
- The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program fails to handle the case (0, 0, 6) correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the identified issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases.

**Final: False**
