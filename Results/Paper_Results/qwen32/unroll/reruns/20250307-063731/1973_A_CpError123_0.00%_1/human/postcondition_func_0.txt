The function takes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list `cas_de_test` of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. It returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of draws for the corresponding test case or -1 if the scores do not satisfy the conditions for a valid match.
