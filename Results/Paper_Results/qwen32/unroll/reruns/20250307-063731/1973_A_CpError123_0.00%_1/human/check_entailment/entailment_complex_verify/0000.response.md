### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotations to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the given examples.

1. **Total Points Calculation:**
   - The code correctly calculates the total points using `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`.
   - It also correctly checks if the total points are even, as the total points from a series of games must be even (each game contributes 2 points, either as 2 for a win and 0 for a loss, or 1 for each player in a draw).

2. **Total Matches Calculation:**
   - The code calculates the total number of matches using `total_matchs = total_points // 2`.

3. **Constraints on Matches:**
   - The code checks if `total_matchs > 3` or `p3 > total_matchs`. However, these constraints are too restrictive:
     - `total_matchs > 3` is incorrect because more than 3 games can be played if there are multiple matches between the players.
     - `p3 > total_matchs` is also incorrect because `p3` (the highest score) can be less than `total_matchs` in valid scenarios.

4. **Draws Calculation:**
   - The formula used to calculate the number of draws (`egalites`) is:
     ```python
     egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
     ```
   - This formula is incorrect because it does not properly account for the distribution of wins and draws among the players. It can lead to negative values for `egalites`, which is not possible.

5. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the input `(1, 1, 2)`:
     - `total_points = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4`
     - `total_matchs = total_points // 2 = 2`
     - `egalites = 4 - 2 * (2 - 1) - 2 * (2 - 0) = 4 - 2 - 4 = -2` (which is negative, so the code will return `-1`).
   - The correct approach should be to find the maximum number of draws that can occur while ensuring the scores are consistent with the total points and the constraints.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to properly account for the possible number of wins and draws. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        max_draws = min(p3 - p2, p3 - p1, total_matchs - (p3 - p2))
        if 2 * (p3 - p2) + 2 * (p3 - p1) > total_points:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(max_draws)
    return resultats
```

### Conclusion:
The original code is incorrect because it does not handle the constraints and calculations correctly, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs. The provided example `(1, 1, 2)` demonstrates this issue.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
