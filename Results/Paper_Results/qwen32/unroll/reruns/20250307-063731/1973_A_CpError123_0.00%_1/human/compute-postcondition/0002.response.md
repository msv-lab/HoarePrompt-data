To determine the output state, we need to analyze the loop and understand how it modifies the `resultats` list based on the input values in `cas_de_test`.

The loop iterates over each tuple in `cas_de_test`, which contains the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. For each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)`, the following steps are performed:

1. Calculate the total points: `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`.
2. Check if `total_points` is odd. If it is, append `-1` to `resultats` and continue to the next iteration.
3. Calculate the total number of matches: `total_matchs = total_points // 2`.
4. Check if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or if `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`. If either condition is true, append `-1` to `resultats` and continue to the next iteration.
5. Calculate the number of draws: `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
6. If `egalites` is negative, append `-1` to `resultats`.
7. Otherwise, append `egalites // 2` to `resultats`.

After processing all tuples in `cas_de_test`, the `resultats` list will contain the results for each case.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.
- `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30.
- `resultats` is an empty list.

The output state will be:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `cas_de_test` remains unchanged.
- `resultats` will be a list of integers, each representing the number of draws for each case in `cas_de_test` or `-1` if the conditions are not met.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, `resultats` is a list of integers representing the number of draws or -1 for each case in `cas_de_test`.**
