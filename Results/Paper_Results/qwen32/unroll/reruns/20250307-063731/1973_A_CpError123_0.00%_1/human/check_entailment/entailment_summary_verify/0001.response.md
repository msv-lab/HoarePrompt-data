### Reasoning:

Let's revisit the provided program and the function summary to ensure the correctness of the implementation.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. **Points Distribution:**
   - A win gives 2 points.
   - A draw gives 1 point to each player.

2. **Constraints:**
   - Total points must be even because each game contributes exactly 2 points.
   - The total number of matches played should be consistent with the scores.
   - The highest score (`p3`) cannot exceed the total number of matches.

3. **Calculating Draws:**
   - The formula used to calculate the number of draws is `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - This formula aims to account for the points contributed by wins and then determine the remaining points that must be draws.

#### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Total Points Check:**
   - The program correctly checks if the total points are even. If not, it returns `-1`.

2. **Total Matches Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the total number of matches as `total_matchs = total_points // 2`.
   - It checks if `total_matchs > 3` or `p3 > total_matchs`. If either condition is true, it returns `-1`.

3. **Calculating Draws:**
   - The formula used to calculate the number of draws is `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - If `egalites < 0`, it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `egalites // 2`.

#### Testing with the Example Input:

1. **Case (0, 0, 0):**
   - Total points: 0 (even)
   - Total matches: 0
   - Draws: 0
   - Output: 0 (Correct)

2. **Case (0, 1, 1):**
   - Total points: 2 (even)
   - Total matches: 1
   - Draws: 1
   - Output: 1 (Correct)

3. **Case (1, 1, 1):**
   - Total points: 3 (odd)
   - Output: -1 (Correct)

4. **Case (1, 1, 2):**
   - Total points: 4 (even)
   - Total matches: 2
   - Draws: 2
   - Output: 2 (Correct)

5. **Case (3, 3, 3):**
   - Total points: 9 (odd)
   - Output: -1 (Correct)

6. **Case (3, 4, 5):**
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - Total matches: 6
   - Draws: 6
   - Output: 6 (Correct)

7. **Case (1, 1, 10):**
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - Total matches: 6
   - Draws: 2
   - Output: 2 (Correct)

8. **Case (0, 0, 6):**
   - Total points: 6 (even)
   - Total matches: 3
   - Draws: 3
   - Output: 3 (Incorrect)

#### Issues Found:

The original assessment correctly identified that the program fails in the case of (0, 0, 6). The issue arises because the program does not correctly account for the fact that the highest score (6) cannot be achieved with only 3 matches. The formula used to calculate draws does not correctly validate the feasibility of the scores given the constraints.

#### Correctness:

The program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly the scenario where the highest score cannot be achieved with the total number of matches. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
