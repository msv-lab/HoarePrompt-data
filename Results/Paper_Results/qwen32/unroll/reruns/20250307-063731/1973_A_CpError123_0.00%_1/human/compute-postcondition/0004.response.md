Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases (with the constraint 1 <= t <= 500), and `cas_de_test`, which is a list of `t` tuples. Each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order (with the constraint 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30). The function returns a list `resultats` of integers, where each integer represents the number of draws in the corresponding test case from `cas_de_test` or -1 if there is an error.**
