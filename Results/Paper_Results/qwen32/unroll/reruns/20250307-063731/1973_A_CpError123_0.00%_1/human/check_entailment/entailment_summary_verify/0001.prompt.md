You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
t = 7
cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]
resultats = func_1(t, cas_de_test)
print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))

def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
    return resultats



- Function Summary: 
The function takes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list `cas_de_test` of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. It returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of draws for the corresponding test case or -1 if the scores do not satisfy the conditions for a valid match.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Analysis:

1. **Total Points Check:**
   - The program first calculates the total points (`total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`).
   - It then checks if the total points are even (`if total_points % 2 != 0`). If they are not, it returns `-1` because the total points should be even (each game contributes 2 points, either distributed as 2-0 or 1-1).
   
2. **Total Matches Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the total number of matches played (`total_matchs = total_points // 2`).
   - It then checks if the total number of matches exceeds 3 (`if total_matchs > 3`) or if the highest score (`p3`) is greater than the total matches (`if p3 > total_matchs`). If either condition is true, it returns `-1` because it's impossible to have more matches than the total possible matches (3) or for one player to have more wins than the total matches played.

3. **Calculating Draws:**
   - The program calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - If the calculated number of draws is negative (`if egalites < 0`), it returns `-1` because a negative number of draws is impossible.
   - Otherwise, it returns the number of draws divided by 2 (`resultats.append(egalites // 2)`).

### Testing with the Example Input:

Let's test the program with the provided example input to ensure it handles various cases correctly:

1. **Case (0, 0, 0):**
   - Total points: 0 (even)
   - Total matches: 0
   - Draws: 0
   - Output: 0

2. **Case (0, 1, 1):**
   - Total points: 2 (even)
   - Total matches: 1
   - Draws: 1
   - Output: 1

3. **Case (0, 2, 3):**
   - Total points: 5 (odd)
   - Output: -1

4. **Case (3, 3, 3):**
   - Total points: 9 (odd)
   - Output: -1

5. **Case (3, 4, 5):**
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - Total matches: 6
   - Draws: 6
   - Output: 6

6. **Case (1, 1, 10):**
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - Total matches: 6
   - Draws: 2
   - Output: 2

7. **Case (0, 0, 6):**
   - Total points: 6 (even)
   - Total matches: 3
   - Draws: 3
   - Output: 3

### Issues Found:

- **Case (0, 2, 3):** The program should output `-1` because the total points are odd, which is correct.
- **Case (3, 3, 3):** The program should output `-1` because the total points are odd, which is correct.
- **Case (0, 2, 3):** The program should output `-1` but the expected output is `-1` (correct).
- **Case (3, 3, 3):** The program should output `-1` but the expected output is `-1` (correct).
- **Case (0, 0, 6):** The program should output `3` but the expected output is `2`. This is incorrect because the highest score (6) cannot be achieved with only 3 matches.

### Correctness:

The program fails to handle the case where the highest score cannot be achieved with the total number of matches correctly. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that the highest score must be achievable with the total number of matches and the points distribution rules.

Correctness: **False**
