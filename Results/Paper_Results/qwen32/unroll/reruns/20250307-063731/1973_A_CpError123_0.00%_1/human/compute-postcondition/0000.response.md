Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, representing the scores of the three players in a non-decreasing order; `resultats` is an empty list.**

Natural language: The variable `resultats` has been initialized as an empty list, while the values of `t` and `cas_de_test` remain unchanged.
