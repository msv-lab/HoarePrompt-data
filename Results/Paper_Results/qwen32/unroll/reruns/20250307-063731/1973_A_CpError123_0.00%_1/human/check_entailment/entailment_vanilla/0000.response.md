Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Analysis:

1. **Total Points Check:**
   - The program first calculates the total points (`total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`).
   - It then checks if the total points are even (`if total_points % 2 != 0`). If they are not, it returns `-1` because the total points should be even (each game contributes 2 points, either distributed as 2-0 or 1-1).
   
2. **Total Matches Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the total number of matches played (`total_matchs = total_points // 2`).
   - It then checks if the total number of matches exceeds 3 (`if total_matchs > 3`) or if the highest score (`p3`) is greater than the total matches (`if p3 > total_matchs`). If either condition is true, it returns `-1` because it's impossible to have more matches than the total possible matches (3) or for one player to have more wins than the total matches played.

3. **Calculating Draws:**
   - The program calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - If the calculated number of draws is negative (`if egalites < 0`), it returns `-1` because a negative number of draws is impossible.
   - Otherwise, it returns the number of draws divided by 2 (`resultats.append(egalites // 2)`).

### Testing with the Example Input:

Let's test the program with the provided example input to ensure it handles various cases correctly:

1. **Case (0, 0, 0):**
   - Total points: 0 (even)
   - Total matches: 0
   - Draws: 0
   - Output: 0

2. **Case (0, 1, 1):**
   - Total points: 2 (even)
   - Total matches: 1
   - Draws: 1
   - Output: 1

3. **Case (0, 2, 3):**
   - Total points: 5 (odd)
   - Output: -1

4. **Case (3, 3, 3):**
   - Total points: 9 (odd)
   - Output: -1

5. **Case (3, 4, 5):**
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - Total matches: 6
   - Draws: 6
   - Output: 6

6. **Case (1, 1, 10):**
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - Total matches: 6
   - Draws: 2
   - Output: 2

7. **Case (0, 0, 6):**
   - Total points: 6 (even)
   - Total matches: 3
   - Draws: 3
   - Output: 3

### Issues Found:

- **Case (0, 2, 3):** The program should output `-1` because the total points are odd, which is correct.
- **Case (3, 3, 3):** The program should output `-1` because the total points are odd, which is correct.
- **Case (0, 2, 3):** The program should output `-1` but the expected output is `-1` (correct).
- **Case (3, 3, 3):** The program should output `-1` but the expected output is `-1` (correct).
- **Case (0, 0, 6):** The program should output `3` but the expected output is `2`. This is incorrect because the highest score (6) cannot be achieved with only 3 matches.

### Correctness:

The program fails to handle the case where the highest score cannot be achieved with the total number of matches correctly. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that the highest score must be achievable with the total number of matches and the points distribution rules.

Correctness: **False**
