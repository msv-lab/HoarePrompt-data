You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and cas_de_test is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, representing the scores of the three players in a non-decreasing order.
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, `resultats` is a list of integers representing the number of draws or -1 for each case in `cas_de_test`.
    return resultats
    #The program returns `resultats`, which is a list of integers representing the number of draws or -1 for each case in `cas_de_test`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases (with the constraint 1 <= t <= 500), and `cas_de_test`, which is a list of `t` tuples. Each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order (with the constraint 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30). The function returns a list `resultats` of integers, where each integer represents the number of draws in the corresponding test case from `cas_de_test` or -1 if there is an error.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `resultats`, which is a list of integers representing the number of draws or -1 for each case in `cas_de_test`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
