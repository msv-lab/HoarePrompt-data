Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that can lead to incorrect results for certain inputs. Let's analyze the code and find a problematic case.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of `egalites`:** The logic to calculate the number of draws (`egalites`) is incorrect. The formula used:
   ```python
   egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
   ```
   does not correctly account for all possible scenarios of wins and draws. This can lead to incorrect results or negative values for `egalites`.

2. **Incorrect Check for `total_matchs`:** The condition:
   ```python
   if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
       resultats.append(-1)
       continue
   ```
   is too restrictive. `total_matchs` can be greater than 3 if there are more than 3 games played. The condition `p3 > total_matchs` is also incorrect because `p3` can be less than `total_matchs` in valid scenarios.

### Problematic Case:
Let's consider the input `(1, 1, 2)`. According to the problem description, the output should be `2` because:
- One possible scenario is that one player played two games and won both, while the other two players played one game each and drew.

However, the provided code will output `-1` for this input. Here's why:
- `total_points = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4`
- `total_matchs = total_points // 2 = 2`
- `egalites = 4 - 2 * (2 - 1) - 2 * (2 - 0) = 4 - 2 - 4 = -2` (which is negative, so the code will return `-1`)

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to properly account for the possible number of wins and draws. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        max_draws = min(p3 - p2, p3 - p1, total_matchs - (p3 - p2))
        if 2 * (p3 - p2) + 2 * (p3 - p1) > total_points:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(max_draws)
    return resultats
```

This corrected function properly calculates the maximum number of draws and handles the constraints correctly. Therefore, the original code is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**. The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases, as demonstrated by the example `(1, 1, 2)`.
