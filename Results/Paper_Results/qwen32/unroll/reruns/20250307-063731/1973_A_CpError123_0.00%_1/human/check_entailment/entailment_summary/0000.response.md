### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to calculate the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players in chess games. The logic of the program is as follows:

1. **Total Points Calculation**: The program calculates the total number of points across all three players. Since each game results in a total of 2 points being distributed (either 2 to the winner, or 1 to each in case of a draw), the total points should be even. If it's not even, the scores are invalid, and the function returns -1.

2. **Total Matches Calculation**: The total number of matches played is calculated as `total_points // 2`. This is because each match contributes 2 points.

3. **Constraints Check**: The program checks if the total matches exceed 3, which is the maximum possible number of matches among three players (each pair can play at most once). It also checks if the highest score `p3` is greater than the total matches, which would be impossible since the highest score cannot exceed the number of matches played.

4. **Draws Calculation**: The program calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. This formula is derived from the fact that the difference in scores between `p3` and `p2` and between `p3` and `p1` must be accounted for by wins, and the remaining points can be attributed to draws. If the calculated number of draws is negative, it indicates an inconsistency, and the function returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the number of draws divided by 2 (since each draw contributes 2 points).

### Issues in the Program:

- **Incorrect Formula for Draws**: The formula used to calculate the number of draws is incorrect. The formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` does not correctly account for the distribution of points among the players and the number of draws. For example, in the test case `(1, 1, 10)`, the program incorrectly calculates the number of draws as 2, which is not possible given the scores.

- **Test Case `(0, 2, 3)`**: This test case is not included in the problem statement's examples, but it is present in the provided `cas_de_test`. According to the problem statement, the scores should be non-decreasing, and the provided formula does not correctly handle cases where the scores do not align with a valid match sequence.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified in the formula and the handling of certain test cases, the program does not correctly determine the maximum number of draws for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
