The only objects in the loop head are the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cas_de_test` list. If the list has at least one tuple, the loop will execute. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `cas_de_test` must contain at least one tuple. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will be taken from the first tuple in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple, `resultats` is an empty list, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the elements of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`**
