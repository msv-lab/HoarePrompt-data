You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
t = 7
cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]
resultats = func_1(t, cas_de_test)
print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))

def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
    return resultats



- Function Summary: 
The function takes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list `cas_de_test` of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. It returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of draws for the corresponding test case or -1 if the scores do not satisfy the conditions for a valid match.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that can lead to incorrect results for certain inputs. Let's analyze the code and find a problematic case.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of `egalites`:** The logic to calculate the number of draws (`egalites`) is incorrect. The formula used:
   ```python
   egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
   ```
   does not correctly account for all possible scenarios of wins and draws. This can lead to incorrect results or negative values for `egalites`.

2. **Incorrect Check for `total_matchs`:** The condition:
   ```python
   if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
       resultats.append(-1)
       continue
   ```
   is too restrictive. `total_matchs` can be greater than 3 if there are more than 3 games played. The condition `p3 > total_matchs` is also incorrect because `p3` can be less than `total_matchs` in valid scenarios.

### Problematic Case:
Let's consider the input `(1, 1, 2)`. According to the problem description, the output should be `2` because:
- One possible scenario is that one player played two games and won both, while the other two players played one game each and drew.

However, the provided code will output `-1` for this input. Here's why:
- `total_points = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4`
- `total_matchs = total_points // 2 = 2`
- `egalites = 4 - 2 * (2 - 1) - 2 * (2 - 0) = 4 - 2 - 4 = -2` (which is negative, so the code will return `-1`)

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to properly account for the possible number of wins and draws. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        max_draws = min(p3 - p2, p3 - p1, total_matchs - (p3 - p2))
        if 2 * (p3 - p2) + 2 * (p3 - p1) > total_points:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(max_draws)
    return resultats
```

This corrected function properly calculates the maximum number of draws and handles the constraints correctly. Therefore, the original code is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**. The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases, as demonstrated by the example `(1, 1, 2)`.
