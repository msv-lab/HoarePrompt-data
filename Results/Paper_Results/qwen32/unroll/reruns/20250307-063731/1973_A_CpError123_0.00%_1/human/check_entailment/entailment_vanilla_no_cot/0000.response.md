Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains some logical errors and does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws or handle all edge cases properly. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Total Matches**: The condition `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:` is incorrect. The maximum number of matches that can be played among three players is not limited to 3. It can be more, depending on the number of games played.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Draws**: The calculation of `egalites` is incorrect. The formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` does not correctly account for the maximum possible draws.

3. **Handling of Specific Cases**: The program does not handle specific cases correctly. For example, in the test case `(1, 1, 1)`, the program incorrectly returns `-1` instead of `0` (since it's possible to have a single draw among the three players).

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matches = total_points // 2
        max_draws = min(p3 - p2, p3 - p1, total_matches - (p3 - p2) - (p3 - p1))
        if p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1) % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(max_draws)
    return resultats

t = 7
cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10)]
resultats = func_1(t, cas_de_test)
print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))
```

This corrected version should handle the problem requirements correctly.
