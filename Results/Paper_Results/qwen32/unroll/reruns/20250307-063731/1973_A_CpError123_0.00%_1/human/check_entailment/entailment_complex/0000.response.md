### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and check if it correctly calculates the maximum number of draws based on the scores provided.

1. **Total Points Check:** The program first checks if the total points across all three players are even. Since each game results in a total of 2 points being distributed (either 2-0 or 1-1), the total points must be even. If not, the result is `-1`.

2. **Total Matches Calculation:** The program calculates the total number of matches played by dividing the total points by 2. This is because each match contributes 2 points.

3. **Constraints on Matches:** 
   - The total number of matches cannot exceed 3, as each player can play a maximum of 2 matches (against the other two players).
   - The score of the highest-scoring player (`p3`) cannot exceed the total number of matches, as each match can contribute at most 2 points to a single player.

4. **Draw Calculation:** 
   - The program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. This formula attempts to account for the points given to the highest-scoring player and adjusts the total points to find the number of draws.
   - If the calculated number of draws (`egalites`) is negative, it is not possible to achieve the given scores, and the result is `-1`.
   - Otherwise, the number of draws is `egalites // 2` because each draw contributes 2 points.

### Checking the Program with the Provided Examples:

Let's go through the provided examples to see if the program's logic holds.

1. **Example 1: (0, 0, 0)**
   - Total points: 0 (even)
   - Total matches: 0
   - Draws: 0
   
2. **Example 2: (0, 1, 1)**
   - Total points: 2 (even)
   - Total matches: 1
   - Draws: 1
   
3. **Example 3: (1, 1, 1)**
   - Total points: 3 (odd)
   - Result: -1 (correct)
   
4. **Example 4: (1, 1, 2)**
   - Total points: 4 (even)
   - Total matches: 2
   - Draws: 2
   
5. **Example 5: (3, 3, 3)**
   - Total points: 9 (odd)
   - Result: -1 (correct)
   
6. **Example 6: (3, 4, 5)**
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - Total matches: 6
   - Draws: 6
   
7. **Example 7: (1, 1, 10)**
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - Total matches: 6
   - Draws: 2

The program seems to correctly handle these examples.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or if the scores are inconsistent. Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided examples and the logic described.

Correctness: **True**
