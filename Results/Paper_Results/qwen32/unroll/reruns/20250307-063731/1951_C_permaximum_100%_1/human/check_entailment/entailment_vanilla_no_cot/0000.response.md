Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. The issue lies in the way the priority queue (min-heap) is used and how the price increases are handled.

Here are the key problems:

1. **Price Increase Handling**: The program increases the price for all subsequent days when tickets are bought, but it does not update the prices in the heap accordingly. This means that the heap will not always contain the current minimum price for each day, leading to incorrect results.

2. **Heap Update**: When tickets are bought on a particular day, the price for that day should be updated and reinserted into the heap along with the increased price for subsequent days. However, the current implementation only pops the minimum price from the heap and does not reinsert the updated prices.

3. **Heap Reinsertion**: The heap should be updated with the new prices after each purchase. This involves recalculating the new price for the current day and all future days and reinserting these updated prices into the heap.

To fix these issues, the program should:
- After buying `x` tickets on a day, update the price for that day and all subsequent days.
- Reinsert the updated prices back into the heap.
- Ensure that the heap always contains the current minimum price for each day.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    import heapq
    pq = [(price, i) for (i, price) in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    price_increase = 0
    
    while tickets_bought < k:
        (price, day) = heapq.heappop(pq)
        price += price_increase
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        price_increase += tickets_to_buy
        
        # Update the prices for the remaining days
        for i in range(day, n):
            new_price = prices[i] + price_increase
            heapq.heappush(pq, (new_price, i))
    
    return total_cost
```

However, even this corrected version might not be efficient enough for the large input constraints given in the problem. A more efficient approach might be required, possibly involving dynamic programming or a more optimized way of handling the price increases.
