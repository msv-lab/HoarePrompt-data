### Reasoning:
The provided Python program uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always buy tickets from the day with the lowest current price, which is a greedy strategy. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, representing the number of days, the maximum tickets that can be bought per day, and the total number of tickets required, respectively.
   - It also reads the list of prices for each day.

2. **Priority Queue**:
   - A priority queue `pq` is created to store tuples of (price, day_index). This queue is then heapified to allow efficient retrieval of the minimum price.
   - `total_cost` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the total expenditure.
   - `tickets_bought` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the number of tickets purchased.
   - `price_increase` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the cumulative increase in ticket prices due to previous purchases.

3. **Buying Tickets**:
   - The program enters a loop that continues until `tickets_bought` equals `k`.
   - In each iteration, it pops the day with the minimum price from the priority queue.
   - The price for that day is adjusted by adding the `price_increase` to account for previous purchases.
   - The number of tickets to buy on that day is the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets allowed per day) and `k - tickets_bought` (the remaining tickets needed).
   - The cost for the tickets bought on that day is added to `total_cost`.
   - The number of tickets bought is updated.
   - The `price_increase` is incremented by the number of tickets bought on that day, reflecting the price increase for subsequent days.

4. **Return**:
   - Once `tickets_bought` equals `k`, the loop exits, and the function returns `total_cost`, which is the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets.

### Correctness:
The greedy strategy of always buying tickets from the day with the lowest current price, adjusted for previous purchases, ensures that the total cost is minimized. This is because buying tickets at lower prices first and then accounting for the price increase is optimal.

Given the constraints and the logic of the program, the implementation correctly solves the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
