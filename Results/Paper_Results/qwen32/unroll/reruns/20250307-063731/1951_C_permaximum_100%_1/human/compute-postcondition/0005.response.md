To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the loop condition and adjust the relevant state variables accordingly. The loop condition is `tickets_bought < k`. 

Given the state:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5
- `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9
- `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9)
- `prices` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9
- `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple is `(price, i)` for each `price` in `prices` and its corresponding index `i`
- `total_cost` is 0
- `tickets_bought` is 0
- `price_increase` is 0

The only variable in the loop head is `tickets_bought`. For the loop to execute, `tickets_bought` must be less than `k`. Since `tickets_bought` is initially 0, the condition `0 < k` will always be true as long as `k` is at least 1, which it is according to the given constraints.

Therefore, no adjustment to the state is necessary for the loop to execute its first iteration. The state remains the same.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9), `prices` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple is `(price, i)` for each `price` in `prices` and its corresponding index `i`, `total_cost` is 0, `tickets_bought` is 0, `price_increase` is 0**
