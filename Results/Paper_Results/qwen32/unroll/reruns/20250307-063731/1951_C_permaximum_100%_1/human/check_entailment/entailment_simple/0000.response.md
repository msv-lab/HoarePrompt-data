### Reasoning:

The provided Python program uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always buy tickets on the day with the currently lowest price, taking into account the price increases from previous purchases. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a priority queue (`pq`) with tuples of `(price, day)` for each day.
   - It also initializes `total_cost` to 0, `tickets_bought` to 0, and `price_increase` to 0.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`.
   - In each iteration, it pops the day with the lowest current price (`price`) from the priority queue.
   - It adjusts this price by adding `price_increase` (the cumulative price increase due to previous purchases).
   - It calculates the number of tickets to buy on this day as the minimum of `m` (the maximum allowed per day) and `k - tickets_bought` (the remaining tickets needed).
   - It adds the cost of these tickets to `total_cost`.
   - It increments `tickets_bought` by the number of tickets purchased.
   - It increases `price_increase` by the number of tickets purchased.

3. **Return Value**:
   - The loop terminates once `tickets_bought` equals `k`.
   - The program then returns `total_cost`, which is the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Approach**:
  - The use of a priority queue ensures that tickets are always bought on the day with the lowest current price, minimizing the total cost.
  - The `price_increase` variable correctly tracks the cumulative price increase from previous purchases, ensuring that the price for subsequent days is adjusted accordingly.
  - The logic for calculating the number of tickets to buy each day is correct, ensuring that the maximum allowed tickets (`m`) are bought each day unless fewer tickets are needed to reach `k`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles cases where `k` is less than `m` by buying only the necessary number of tickets.
  - It also handles cases where `k` is exactly `n * m` by buying the maximum allowed tickets each day.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
