You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze its approach step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to minimize the total cost of purchasing `k` tickets over `n` days, with the following constraints:
- On any given day, you can purchase up to `m` tickets.
- Each purchase of `x` tickets on day `i` increases the price of tickets on all subsequent days by `x`.

### Program Analysis
The provided program uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always buy tickets on the cheapest available day. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of its approach:

1. **Initialization**:
   - It reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of days (`n`), the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day (`m`), and the total number of tickets to be bought (`k`).
   - It reads the list of ticket prices for each day.

2. **Priority Queue**:
   - It creates a priority queue (min-heap) of tuples, where each tuple contains the price and the corresponding day index.
   - The priority queue is used to always extract the day with the lowest ticket price.

3. **Buying Tickets**:
   - It initializes `total_cost` to 0, `tickets_bought` to 0, and `price_increase` to 0.
   - It enters a loop that continues until `tickets_bought` equals `k`.
   - In each iteration, it pops the day with the lowest ticket price from the priority queue.
   - It adjusts the price by adding the `price_increase` to account for previous purchases.
   - It calculates the number of tickets to buy on that day as the minimum of `m` (maximum allowed per day) and `k - tickets_bought` (remaining tickets needed).
   - It updates the `total_cost` by adding the cost of the tickets bought on that day.
   - It increments `tickets_bought` by the number of tickets bought.
   - It updates `price_increase` by adding the number of tickets bought on that day.

4. **Return**:
   - After the loop, it returns the `total_cost`.

### Correctness Verification
The key aspect of this approach is that it always buys tickets on the cheapest available day, taking into account the price increase from previous purchases. This greedy strategy is optimal because it ensures that the most expensive tickets are bought last, minimizing the overall cost.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the described greedy strategy to minimize the cost of purchasing `k` tickets. Therefore, it is correct.
