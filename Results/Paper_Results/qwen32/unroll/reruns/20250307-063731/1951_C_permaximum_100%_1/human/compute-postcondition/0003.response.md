The code snippet provided only initializes a variable `tickets_bought` to 0. None of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `prices`, `pq`, `total_cost`) are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9), `prices` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple is `(price, i)` for each `price` in `prices` and its corresponding index `i`, `total_cost` is 0, `tickets_bought` is 0.**
