Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9), `prices` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple is `(price, i)` for each `price` in `prices` and its corresponding index `i`.**

In simpler terms, `pq` is now a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`) remain unchanged.
