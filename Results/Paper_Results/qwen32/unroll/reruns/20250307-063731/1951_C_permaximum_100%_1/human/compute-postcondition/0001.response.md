The `heapq.heapify(pq)` function transforms the list `pq` into a heap in-place. This means that the list `pq` will now satisfy the heap property, where each parent node is less than or equal to its child nodes. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices` remain unchanged as they are not directly manipulated by the `heapify` function.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9), `prices` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple is `(price, i)` for each `price` in `prices` and its corresponding index `i`.**
