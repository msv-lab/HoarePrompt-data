To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze its approach step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to minimize the total cost of purchasing `k` tickets over `n` days, with the following constraints:
- On any given day, you can purchase up to `m` tickets.
- Each purchase of `x` tickets on day `i` increases the price of tickets on all subsequent days by `x`.

### Program Analysis
The provided program uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always buy tickets on the cheapest available day. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of its approach:

1. **Initialization**:
   - It reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of days (`n`), the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day (`m`), and the total number of tickets to be bought (`k`).
   - It reads the list of ticket prices for each day.

2. **Priority Queue**:
   - It creates a priority queue (min-heap) of tuples, where each tuple contains the price and the corresponding day index.
   - The priority queue is used to always extract the day with the lowest ticket price.

3. **Buying Tickets**:
   - It initializes `total_cost` to 0, `tickets_bought` to 0, and `price_increase` to 0.
   - It enters a loop that continues until `tickets_bought` equals `k`.
   - In each iteration, it pops the day with the lowest ticket price from the priority queue.
   - It adjusts the price by adding the `price_increase` to account for previous purchases.
   - It calculates the number of tickets to buy on that day as the minimum of `m` (maximum allowed per day) and `k - tickets_bought` (remaining tickets needed).
   - It updates the `total_cost` by adding the cost of the tickets bought on that day.
   - It increments `tickets_bought` by the number of tickets bought.
   - It updates `price_increase` by adding the number of tickets bought on that day.

4. **Return**:
   - After the loop, it returns the `total_cost`.

### Correctness Verification
The key aspect of this approach is that it always buys tickets on the cheapest available day, taking into account the price increase from previous purchases. This greedy strategy is optimal because it ensures that the most expensive tickets are bought last, minimizing the overall cost.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the described greedy strategy to minimize the cost of purchasing `k` tickets. Therefore, it is correct.

Correctness: **True**
