Precondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array a. The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the array a. The total number of elements across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
