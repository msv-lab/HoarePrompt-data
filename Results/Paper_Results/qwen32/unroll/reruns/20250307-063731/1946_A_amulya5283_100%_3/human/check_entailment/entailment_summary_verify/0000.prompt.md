You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers.

The median of an array q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_k is the number p_{\lceil
\frac{k}{2} \rceil} , where p is the array q sorted in non-decreasing order.
For example, the median of the array [9, 5, 1, 2, 6] is 5 , as in the sorted
array [1, 2, 5, 6, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 is 5
, and the median of the array [9, 2, 8, 3] is 3 , as in the sorted array [2,
3, 8, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 is 3 .

You are allowed to choose an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) and increase a_i by 1
in one operation.

Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the
median of the array.

Note that the array a may not necessarily contain distinct numbers.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations
required to increase the median of the array.

Note

In the first test case, you can apply one operation to the first number and
obtain the array [3, 2, 8] , the median of this array is 3 , as it is the
number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 3, 8] . The median of the original array [2, 2, 8] is 2 , as it is
the number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 2, 8] . Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in just one operation.

In the fourth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 2, 3 and obtain the array [6, 6, 6, 4, 5] , the median of this
array is 6 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 6, 6, 6] . The median of the original array
[5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil
= 2 in the non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 5, 5, 5] . Thus, the median
increased (6 > 5 ) in three operations. It can be shown that this is the
minimum possible number of operations.

In the fifth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 3 and obtain the array [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4] , the median of this
array is 3 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 4] . The median of the original
array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2 , as it is the number at index \lceil
\frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4] .
Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in two operations. It can be shown that
this is the minimum possible number of operations.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            res = 0
            mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1
            for i in range(mdx, n):
                if a[mdx] == a[i]:
                    res += 1
            print(res)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a`, followed by `n` integers representing the elements of the array `a`. For each test case, it sorts the array and then determines the number of elements in the second half of the array (including the middle element if `n` is odd) that are equal to the middle element of the array. It prints this count for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Let's analyze the logic and identify a potential issue.

The program sorts the array and then calculates the median index. It then counts how many elements are equal to the median and returns this count as the number of operations required to increase the median. This logic is flawed because it does not actually increase the median; it merely counts the number of elements equal to the current median.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to ensure that the median of the array increases. This can be done by increasing the value of the current median or any value that will become the median after the increase. The minimum number of operations required is the difference between the current median and the next possible median value.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
The median of the array `[1, 1, 2]` is `1`. To increase the median, we need to increase one of the `1`s to `2` or higher. This can be done in one operation, resulting in the array `[2, 1, 2]` or `[1, 2, 2]`, both of which have a median of `2`.

**Actual Output of the Provided Program:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Actual Output:**
The program counts the number of elements equal to the current median (`1`), which is `2`. However, this does not increase the median; it merely counts the number of elements equal to the current median.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.
