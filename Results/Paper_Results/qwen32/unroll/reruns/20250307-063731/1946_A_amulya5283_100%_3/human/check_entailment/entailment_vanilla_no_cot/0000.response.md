Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Here are some issues with the current implementation:

1. **Single Element Array**: The program correctly handles the case where `n == 1` by printing `1`, because the median of a single-element array is the element itself, and to increase it, you need at least one operation.

2. **Median Calculation**: The program calculates the median index correctly using `mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. This gives the correct index of the median in a sorted array.

3. **Counting Equal Elements**: The program counts the number of elements from the median index to the end of the array that are equal to the median value. This count is stored in `res`.

4. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic of counting how many elements are equal to the median and printing that count as the result is incorrect. Increasing the median requires incrementing elements such that the new median is greater than the old median, not just counting how many elements are equal to the median.

To fix the program, you need to:
- Find the current median.
- Determine the next value that would be the new median after increasing some elements.
- Calculate the minimum number of operations required to make at least half of the elements greater than or equal to this new median.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import heapq
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            mdx = n // 2
            current_median = a[mdx]
            next_median = current_median + 1
            
            # Use a min-heap to efficiently find the smallest elements
            min_heap = a[:mdx]
            heapq.heapify(min_heap)
            
            operations = 0
            for i in range(mdx, n):
                if a[i] < next_median:
                    operations += (next_median - a[i])
                    heapq.heappush(min_heap, next_median)
                    smallest = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
                    if smallest < next_median:
                        operations -= (next_median - smallest)
            
            print(operations)

func()
```

This corrected program uses a min-heap to efficiently determine the smallest elements and calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.
