Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Let's analyze the logic and identify a potential issue.

The program sorts the array and then calculates the median index. It then counts how many elements are equal to the median and returns this count as the number of operations required to increase the median. This logic is flawed because it does not actually increase the median; it merely counts the number of elements equal to the current median.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to ensure that the median of the array increases. This can be done by increasing the value of the current median or any value that will become the median after the increase. The minimum number of operations required is the difference between the current median and the next possible median value.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
The median of the array `[1, 1, 2]` is `1`. To increase the median, we need to increase one of the `1`s to `2` or higher. This can be done in one operation, resulting in the array `[2, 1, 2]` or `[1, 2, 2]`, both of which have a median of `2`.

**Actual Output of the Provided Program:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Actual Output:**
The program counts the number of elements equal to the current median (`1`), which is `2`. However, this does not increase the median; it merely counts the number of elements equal to the current median.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.
