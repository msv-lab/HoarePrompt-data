Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the array and then counting the number of elements in the second half of the array (including the middle element if `n` is odd) that are equal to the middle element. However, this approach does not correctly determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.

The logic in the program is flawed because it does not actually attempt to increase the median. It simply counts how many elements are equal to the current median, which does not necessarily help in increasing the median. To correctly solve the problem, the program should identify the median and then determine the minimum number of increments needed to make at least half of the elements in the sorted array larger than the current median.

For example, consider the test case with the array `[2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4]`. The current median is `2`. To increase the median, we need to make at least three elements greater than `2`. The correct approach would involve identifying the smallest elements that need to be incremented to achieve this.

Since the given program does not implement the correct logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
