Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a`, followed by `n` integers representing the elements of the array `a`. For each test case, it sorts the array and then determines the number of elements in the second half of the array (including the middle element if `n` is odd) that are equal to the middle element of the array. It prints this count for each test case.**
