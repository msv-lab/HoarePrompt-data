Let's analyze the provided program in the context of the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a Hamiltonian path in a graph that originally was complete but had (n-2) edges removed.
   - We can ask up to n queries of the form "? d", which will return a vertex v with at least degree d (minimum degree and vertex number if multiple exist), and another vertex u not connected to v (or 0 if none exists).
   - After each query, vertex v and its edges are removed from the graph.
   - We need to output the Hamiltonian path after finding it.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function sends a query "? d" to the system and reads the response. It returns the two integers (v, u) that the system responds with.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function constructs the Hamiltonian path.
     - It initializes an empty path and a set of remaining vertices.
     - It repeatedly asks queries with decreasing degrees (from n-1 to 0) until it finds a valid vertex v.
     - If a valid vertex v is found, it adds v to the path and removes v from the remaining vertices.
     - The loop continues until all vertices are added to the path.
     - Finally, it prints the path in the required format.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The program correctly implements the strategy of repeatedly querying for vertices with the highest possible degree until it finds a valid vertex.
   - It ensures that each vertex is added to the path exactly once and removed from the set of remaining vertices.
   - The program correctly flushes the output after each query and when printing the final path.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where no vertex with the current degree d exists by continuing to the next lower degree.
   - It correctly handles the smallest possible graph (n=2) by querying with degree 0 and adding the vertices to the path.

5. **Query Limit:**
   - The program makes at most n queries, which is within the allowed limit.
   - Each query is correctly formatted and the output is flushed after each query.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the strategy to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph within the given constraints and requirements.

**Correctness: **True**
