You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

Kostyanych has chosen a complete undirected graph^{\dagger} with n vertices,
and then removed exactly (n - 2) edges from it. You can ask queries of the
following type:

  * "? d " — Kostyanych tells you the number of vertex v with a degree at least d . Among all possible such vertices, he selects the vertex with the minimum degree, and if there are several such vertices, he selects the one with the minimum number. He also tells you the number of another vertex in the graph, with which v is not connected by an edge (if none is found, then 0 is reported). Among all possible such vertices, he selects the one with the minimum number. Then he removes the vertex v and all edges coming out of it. If the required vertex v is not found, then "0\ 0 " is reported. 

Find a Hamiltonian path^{\ddagger} in the original graph in at most n queries.
It can be proven that under these constraints, a Hamiltonian path always
exists.

^{\dagger} A complete undirected graph is a graph in which there is exactly
one undirected edge between any pair of distinct vertices. Thus, a complete
undirected graph with n vertices contains \frac{n(n-1)}{2} edges.

^{\ddagger} A Hamiltonian path in a graph is a path that passes through each
vertex exactly once.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of vertices in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Interaction

Interaction for each test case begins with reading the integer n .

Then you can make no more than n queries.

To make a query, output a line in the format "? d " (without quotes) (0 \le d
\le n - 1 ). After each query, read two integers — the answer to your query.

When you are ready to report the answer, output a line in the format "! v_1\
v_2 \ldots v_n " (without quotes) — the vertices in the order of their
occurrence in the Hamiltonian path. Outputting the answer does not count as
one of the n queries. After solving one test case, the program should
immediately move on to the next one. After solving all test cases, the program
should be terminated immediately.

If your program makes more than n queries for one test case or makes an
incorrect query, then the response to the query will be -1 , and after
receiving such a response, your program should immediately terminate to
receive the verdict Wrong answer. Otherwise, it may receive any other verdict.

After outputting a query, do not forget to output an end of line and flush the
output buffer. Otherwise, you will receive the verdict Idleness limit
exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see documentation for other languages. 

The interactor is non-adaptive. The graph does not change during the
interaction.

Hacks

To hack, use the following format:

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of vertices in the graph.

Each of the following (n - 2) lines should contains two integers u and v (1
\le u, v \le n , u \ne v ) — ends of the edge that was removed from the graph.
Each edge must not occur more than once.

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^5 .

Note

In the first test case, the original graph looks as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/75d8c5328ccca8f82b69ba8300140bed4d40ce80.png)

Consider the queries:

  * There are no vertices with a degree of at least 3 in the graph, so "0\ 0 " is reported.
  * There are four vertices with a degree of at least 2 , and all of them have a degree of exactly 2 : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . Vertex 1 is reported, because it has the minimum number, and vertex 4 is reported, because it is the only one not connected to vertex 1 . After this, vertex 1 is removed from the graph.
  * There are three vertices with a degree of at least 1 , among them vertices 2 and 3 have a minimum degree of 1 (vertex 4 has a degree of 2 ). Vertex 2 is reported, because it has the minimum number, and vertex 3 is reported, because it is the only one not connected to vertex 2 . After this, vertex 2 is removed from the graph.

The path 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 is a Hamiltonian path.

In the second test case, the original graph looks as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/44d26c229eaff752c0a00c7160792daef41c7502.png)

Consider the queries:

  * Vertex 1 has a degree of at least 3 , but it is connected to all vertices, so "1\ 0 " is reported. After this, vertex 1 is removed from the graph.
  * The remaining vertices 2 , 3 , and 4 have a degree of at least 0 , but among them vertex 4 has the minimum degree of 0 (vertices 2 and 3 have a degree of 1 ). Vertex 4 is not connected to both vertices 2 and 3 , so vertex 2 is reported (as it has the minimum number). After this, vertex 4 is removed from the graph.

The path 4 - 1 - 2 - 3 is a Hamiltonian path.

In the third test case, the graph consists of 2 vertices connected by an edge.

- Annotated Code: 
import sys

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    func_2(n)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= d <= n - 1, where n is the number of vertices in the graph.
def func_1(d):
    print(f'? {d}')
    #This is printed: ? [d] (where d is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= d <= n - 1)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    v, u = map(int, input().split())
    return v, u
    #The program returns the tuple (v, u), where v and u are the two integers obtained from the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `d` as a parameter, which is within the range of 0 to `n - 1`, where `n` is the number of vertices in a graph. It prints a query with this integer, flushes the output, and then reads two integers from the input. The function returns these two integers as a tuple (v, u).

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5.
def func_2(n):
    path = []
    remaining_vertices = set(range(1, n + 1))
    while remaining_vertices:
        for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):

    #State: `remaining_vertices` is an empty set, and `path` is a list containing all integers from 1 to `n` in the order they were added.
    print(f"! {' '.join(map(str, path))}")
    #This is printed: ! 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the total number of integers in the path list, and path contains integers from 1 to n in the order they were added)
    sys.stdout.flush()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of vertices in a graph, and prints a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` in a specific order determined by the internal logic of the function. The final state of the program is that all integers from 1 to `n` are printed in a single line, prefixed with an exclamation mark, and separated by spaces.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the removal of vertices and their associated edges, and it does not ensure that a Hamiltonian path is found within the given constraints. Here are a few issues:

1. **Vertex Removal Handling**: The code does not correctly handle the removal of vertices and updating the degrees of the remaining vertices. The degree of vertices changes as vertices are removed, and the program does not account for this. The program simply removes the vertex from the set of remaining vertices without updating the degrees of other vertices.

2. **Query Logic**: The program makes queries with decreasing degree `d` values but does not correctly handle the case when `v == 0`. When `v == 0`, it means no vertex with degree at least `d` exists, and the program should adjust its query strategy accordingly. The current implementation simply continues to the next degree without properly handling this case.

3. **Edge Disconnection Handling**: The program does not properly handle the disconnection of vertices. When a vertex `v` is selected, the program should ensure that the vertex `u` is not connected to `v` and should be part of the path. The current implementation does not verify this condition.

4. **Path Construction**: The path construction logic is flawed. The program simply appends the selected vertex `v` to the path without ensuring that it forms a valid Hamiltonian path. The program should ensure that the path is valid and that each vertex is connected to the previous and next vertices in the path.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases such as graphs with the minimum number of vertices (n = 2) or graphs where the removed edges are such that the graph remains highly connected. The current implementation may fail to find a valid Hamiltonian path in these scenarios.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description and is therefore incorrect.
