The code initializes a set named `remaining_vertices` with all integers from 1 to `n`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and `path` is still an empty list. The set `remaining_vertices` now contains all vertex numbers from 1 to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing all integers from 1 to `n`.**
