To understand the output state, let's break down the loop and the operations performed within it:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph.
   - `path` is an empty list.
   - `remaining_vertices` is a set containing all integers from 1 to `n`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The `while` loop continues as long as `remaining_vertices` is not empty.
   - Inside the `while` loop, there is a `for` loop that iterates over `d` from `n-1` down to `0`.
   - For each `d`, the function `func_1(d)` is called, which presumably returns a pair of vertices `(v, u)`.
   - If `v` is `0`, the loop continues to the next iteration.
   - If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is appended to `path`, removed from `remaining_vertices`, and the inner `for` loop is broken, moving to the next iteration of the `while` loop.
   - This process repeats until `remaining_vertices` is empty.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when `remaining_vertices` is empty, meaning all vertices from `1` to `n` have been added to `path` and removed from `remaining_vertices`.

**Output State**:
- `remaining_vertices` will be an empty set because all vertices have been processed and removed.
- `path` will contain all vertices from `1` to `n` in the order they were processed and added to `path`.

Given the described behavior, the final state of the variables will be:

Output State: **`remaining_vertices` is an empty set, and `path` is a list containing all integers from 1 to `n` in the order they were added.**
