The provided code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream. This operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program. Therefore, the values of `remaining_vertices` and `path` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`remaining_vertices` is an empty set, and `path` is a list containing all integers from 1 to `n` in the order they were added.**
