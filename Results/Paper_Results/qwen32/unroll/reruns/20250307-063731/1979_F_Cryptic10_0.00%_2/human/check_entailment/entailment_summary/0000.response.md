### Reasoning:
To determine if the provided program correctly solves the problem, we need to analyze the logic and behavior of both `func_1` and `func_2` in the context of the problem description.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: This function makes a query to the interactor with a degree `d` and retrieves the response.
- **Behavior**: It prints the query `? d`, flushes the output to ensure the query is sent, and then reads the response which consists of two integers `v` and `u`.
- **Output**: It returns the tuple `(v, u)` as described in the problem statement.
- **Correctness**: This function is correctly implemented according to the problem's requirements. It sends the query and processes the response as intended.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: This function finds a Hamiltonian path by repeatedly querying the interactor and building the path based on the responses.
- **Behavior**: It initializes an empty path and a set of remaining vertices. It iterates over possible degrees from `n-1` down to `0`, using `func_1` to find a vertex `v` with degree at least `d` that hasn't been removed yet. If such a vertex is found, it adds it to the path and removes it from the set of remaining vertices. It continues until all vertices are included in the path.
- **Output**: After all vertices are added to the path, it prints the path in the required format.
- **Correctness**: The logic of `func_2` is flawed. The function attempts to find a vertex with the highest possible degree first, which is not guaranteed to lead to a Hamiltonian path. The problem specifies that we need to find a vertex with degree at least `d` and remove it, but the strategy of starting with the highest degree and decrementing might not ensure that we can always find a valid vertex to add to the path, especially as vertices are removed. The function does not guarantee that it will always find a vertex that can be part of a Hamiltonian path in the remaining graph.

### Conclusion:
While `func_1` is correctly implemented, `func_2` does not guarantee the correct construction of a Hamiltonian path. The strategy of starting with the highest degree and decrementing might not always work, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

**Correctness: False**
