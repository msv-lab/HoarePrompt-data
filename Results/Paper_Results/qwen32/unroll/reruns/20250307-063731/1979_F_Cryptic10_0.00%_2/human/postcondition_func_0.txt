The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `d` as a parameter, which is within the range of 0 to `n - 1`, where `n` is the number of vertices in a graph. It prints a query with this integer, flushes the output, and then reads two integers from the input. The function returns these two integers as a tuple (v, u).
