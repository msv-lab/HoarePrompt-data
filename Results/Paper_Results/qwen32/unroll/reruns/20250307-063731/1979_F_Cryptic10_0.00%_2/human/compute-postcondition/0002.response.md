To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to ensure that the condition `remaining_vertices` is not empty. The loop will execute as long as `remaining_vertices` contains at least one element.

Given:
- `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5.
- `path` is an empty list.
- `remaining_vertices` is a set containing all integers from 1 to `n`.

The loop condition is:
```python
while remaining_vertices:
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, `remaining_vertices` must not be empty. Right before the loop, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing all integers from 1 to `n`, which means it is not empty (since `n` is at least 2).

Since `remaining_vertices` is already a set containing all integers from 1 to `n`, no adjustment is needed to ensure that the loop can execute the first time. The condition `remaining_vertices` being non-empty is already satisfied.

Therefore, the state remains the same:
State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing all integers from 1 to `n`**.
