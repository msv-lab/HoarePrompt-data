The function `func_2` takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of vertices in a graph, and prints a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` in a specific order determined by the internal logic of the function. The final state of the program is that all integers from 1 to `n` are printed in a single line, prefixed with an exclamation mark, and separated by spaces.
