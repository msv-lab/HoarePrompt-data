You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We have a tree with exactly two leaves, which means it can be represented as a linear array.
   - The game is played with a stone starting on a specific node.
   - Players alternate moves, where a move is defined as moving the stone to an adjacent inactive node.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Game Analysis**:
   - Since the tree is essentially a linear array, the game can be viewed as moving a stone along a line.
   - The key observation is that the player who starts on a node with an odd number of possible moves (positions to move to) will win if both play optimally.
   - This is because the player who starts on an odd-length segment can always force the opponent to play on an even-length segment, and vice versa.
   - The player who ends up on the last move (when there's only one possible move left) wins.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly identifies the two leaves of the tree (which are the endpoints of the linear array).
   - It constructs the linear array by traversing from one leaf to the other.
   - For the given starting node, it calculates the distance from both ends of the linear array.
   - It then checks if either of these distances is odd. If so, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies the two leaves and constructs the linear array.
   - It calculates the distances from the starting node to both ends of the array.
   - It correctly determines the winner based on whether either distance is odd.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
