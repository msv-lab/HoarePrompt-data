Output State: **`tree` will be a list containing the path from `s` to `e`, with `e` now appended to the list; `prev` will be the node before `e` in the path; `curr` will be `e`.**

Natural Language: After executing the code, the `tree` list now includes the node `e` at the end of the path from `s`. The variable `prev` remains unchanged as the node before `e` in the path, and `curr` is still `e`.
