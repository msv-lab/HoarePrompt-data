The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Ron'`. The initial state and the definitions of various variables (`tree`, `prev`, `curr`, `start`, `idx`, `moves`) are provided, but they are not relevant to the execution of this specific `print` statement. The `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables; it simply prints the string `'Ron'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('Ron')`.
2. This statement directly outputs the string `'Ron'`.
3. None of the variables (`tree`, `prev`, `curr`, `start`, `idx`, `moves`) are used in this `print` statement, so their values do not affect the output.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **Ron**
