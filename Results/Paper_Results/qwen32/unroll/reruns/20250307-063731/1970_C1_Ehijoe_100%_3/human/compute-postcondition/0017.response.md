Output State: **`tree` will be a list containing the path from `s` to `e`, with `e` now appended to the list; `prev` will be the node before `e` in the path; `curr` will be `e`; `start` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads an input integer and assigns it to the variable `start`. The other variables (`tree`, `prev`, and `curr`) are not modified by this code snippet, so their states remain as described in the initial state.
