The code snippet `prev = s` assigns the value of `s` to the variable `prev`. The values of `ends`, `s`, `e`, and `tree` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ends` contains the keys of the two leaf nodes in the tree; `s` is the first key from `ends`; `e` is the second key from `ends`; `tree` is a list containing the single element `s`; `prev` is equal to `s`.**
