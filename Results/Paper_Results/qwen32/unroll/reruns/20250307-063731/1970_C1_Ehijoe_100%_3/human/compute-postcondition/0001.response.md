The provided code snippet only initializes an empty list named `edges`. No other variables are modified, and no operations are performed that would change the values of `n`, `t`, or the input pairs of integers representing the edges of the tree. The starting node `u_1` is also not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State, except for the new variable `edges` which is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5), `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing the edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1) representing the starting node for the single round, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `edges` is an empty list.**
