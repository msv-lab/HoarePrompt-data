The code snippet assigns the list `[idx, n - idx - 1]` to the variable `moves`. The values of `idx` and `n` are used in this assignment, but the values of `tree`, `prev`, `curr`, `start`, and `idx` themselves are not changed by this code.

Output State: **`tree` is a list containing the path from `s` to `e`, with `e` appended to the list; `prev` will be the node before `e` in the path; `curr` will be `e`; `start` is an input integer; `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`; `moves` is `[idx, n - idx - 1]`.**

In natural language: The output state is that `tree`, `prev`, `curr`, `start`, and `idx` remain unchanged. A new variable `moves` is introduced and is assigned a list containing `idx` and `n - idx - 1`.
