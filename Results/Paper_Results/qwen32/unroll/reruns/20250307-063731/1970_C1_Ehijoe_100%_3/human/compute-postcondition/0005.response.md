Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5), `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing the edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1) representing the starting node for the single round, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list that contains the adjacency list representation of the tree.**
