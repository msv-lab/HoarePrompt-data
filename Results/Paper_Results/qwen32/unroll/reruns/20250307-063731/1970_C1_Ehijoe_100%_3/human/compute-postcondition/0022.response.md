Postcondition: **`tree` is a list containing the path from `s` to `e`, with `e` appended to the list; `prev` will be the node before `e` in the path; `curr` will be `e`; `start` is an input integer; `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`; `moves` is `[idx, n - idx - 1]`. Both elements in `moves` are even numbers.**
