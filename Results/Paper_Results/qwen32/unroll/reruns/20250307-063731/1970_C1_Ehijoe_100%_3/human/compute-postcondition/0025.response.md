Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, and an integer `t` which is always 1. The function also accepts `n-1` pairs of integers (u, v) representing the edges of the tree, where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. Additionally, it accepts `t` integers (u_1) representing the starting node for a single round, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n. The function returns an output based on the structure and starting node of the tree.**
