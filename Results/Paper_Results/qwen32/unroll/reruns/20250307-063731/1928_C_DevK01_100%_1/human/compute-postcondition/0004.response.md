Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9, and the length of `q` is between 1 and 100. If `w` is an integer such that `w` equals `w // 1` and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` is a list containing a single element `w`. Otherwise, `M` remains an empty list.**
