Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9, and the length of `q` is between 1 and 100; `M` is an empty list; `w` is an integer such that `w` equals `w // 1` and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**

This postcondition retains all the conditions stated in the precondition and includes the additional conditions specified by the if statement.
