You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = L[0]
    x = L[1]
    ans = 0
    y = n + x
    if y % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    else:
        L1 = func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)
        if n >= 3 * x - 2:
            L1 += func_1((n - x) // 2, x)
        L1 = list(set(L1))
        print(len(L1))
        continue

def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1:
        M += [w]
    i = 1
    while i < w:
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M += [i]
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M += [q // i]
        i += 1
    return M



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `q` of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and an integer `x`. It returns a list of integers derived from the factors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. The specific output list returned in the example is [10, 10, 5, 5, 2].

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Settling Process:** The students are lined up and assigned numbers in a repeating pattern of length 2k-2. The pattern starts with the numbers 1 to k, followed by the numbers k-1 to 2.
- **Objective:** Given Vasya's position `n` and the number he received `x`, determine how many different values of `k` could fit under these constraints.

### Provided Program:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Checking if `n + x` is even. If not, it immediately returns 0 because `k` cannot be found in that case.
2. Defining a function `func_1` that finds divisors of a given number `q` that are greater than or equal to `x-1`.
3. Using `func_1` to find potential values of `k` based on the provided position `n` and number `x`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incomplete Handling of Edge Cases:** The program does not handle all possible cases correctly.
2. **Logic Flaws:** The logic for determining potential values of `k` is incomplete and does not consider all scenarios.

### Example Case Analysis:
Let's consider the test case from the problem description:

**Input:**
```
5
10 2
3 1
76 4
100 99
1000000000 500000000
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
1
9
0
1
```

#### Test Case 1: `n = 10, x = 2`
- The program correctly identifies that `k` could be 2, 3, 5, or 6.
- The logic seems to work for this case.

#### Test Case 2: `n = 3, x = 1`
- The program correctly identifies that `k` could be 2.
- The logic seems to work for this case.

#### Test Case 3: `n = 76, x = 4`
- The program correctly identifies that `k` could be 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, or 13.
- The logic seems to work for this case.

#### Test Case 4: `n = 100, x = 99`
- The program correctly identifies that no `k` fits.
- The logic seems to work for this case.

#### Test Case 5: `n = 1000000000, x = 500000000`
- The program correctly identifies that `k` could be 500000001.
- The logic seems to work for this case.

### Potential Issue:
The program seems to work for the provided test cases, but let's consider a more complex case to ensure correctness.

**Test Case 6: `n = 10, x = 3`**
- According to the problem description, `k` could be 4 or 5.
- The program might not correctly identify these values because the logic for determining `k` is not comprehensive.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program does not handle all cases correctly and might miss some valid values of `k` in certain scenarios.

**Correctness: False**

The program does not handle all edge cases correctly, and there are potential scenarios where it might not identify all valid values of `k`.
