The code snippet initializes an empty list `M`. No changes are made to the variable `q`, which remains a list of tuples as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9, and the length of `q` is between 1 and 100; `M` is an empty list.**
