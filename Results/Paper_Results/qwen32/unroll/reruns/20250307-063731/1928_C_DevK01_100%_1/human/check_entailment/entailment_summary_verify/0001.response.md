Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and its correctness based on the provided problem description, code, and function summary.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine the number of possible values of `k` for which Vasya's position `n` and the number he received `x` during the "firstâ€“k -th" position settling are valid.

The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and within each cycle, the numbers assigned to students are:
- The first `k` students are numbered `1, 2, ..., k`.
- The next `k-2` students are numbered `k-1, k-2, ..., 2`.

### Key Observations

1. **Cycle Length**: The cycle length is `2k - 2`. This means the sequence of numbers repeats every `2k - 2` students.
2. **Position and Number Relationship**: Given position `n` and number `x`, we need to find `k` such that `x` is a valid number at position `n` according to the pattern.
3. **Constraints**: `k > 1` and `1 <= x < n <= 10^9`.

### Program Analysis

The program uses a function `func_1` to find divisors of a number `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. This function is used to determine possible values of `k` based on the given position `n` and number `x`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.

2. **Initial Check**:
   - The program calculates `y = n + x`.
   - If `y` is odd, it prints `0` because the pattern described requires `y` to be even.

3. **Finding Possible `k` Values**:
   - The program calculates `L1` using `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)`.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it adds more possible `k` values by calling `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)`.
   - It converts `L1` to a set to remove duplicates and then prints the length of this set.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function finds all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It first checks if the square root of `q` is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It then iterates through possible divisors up to the square root of `q`.

### Correctness Evaluation

Let's verify the correctness of the program:

1. **Initial Check**:
   - The check `if y % 2 != 0: print(0)` is correct because the pattern described in the problem requires `y` to be even for valid `k`.

2. **Finding Possible `k` Values**:
   - The program uses `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` to find possible `k` values. The function `func_1` returns divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - The additional check `if n >= 3 * x - 2: L1 += func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` is also correct because it accounts for another possible set of `k` values.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly finds all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. This is essential for determining valid `k` values.

### Function Summary Analysis

The function summary provided states that `func_1` accepts a number `q` and an integer `x`, and returns a list of integers derived from the factors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. This matches the implementation of `func_1` in the code.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find possible values of `k` based on the given constraints and the pattern described. It handles the case where `y` is odd separately and uses the `func_1` function to find valid divisors. The use of a set to remove duplicate `k` values ensures that each possible `k` is counted only once.

### Final Evaluation

Based on the analysis, the program appears to be correct and solves the problem as described.

**Final: True**
