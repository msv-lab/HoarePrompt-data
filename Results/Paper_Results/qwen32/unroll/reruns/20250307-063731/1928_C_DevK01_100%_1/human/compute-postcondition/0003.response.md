The code snippet `M += [w]` appends the value of `w` to the list `M`. Since `M` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `M` will contain one element, which is the value of `w`. The other variables, `q` and `w`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9, and the length of `q` is between 1 and 100; `M` is a list containing a single element `w`; `w` is an integer such that `w` equals `w // 1` and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**
