The function `func_1` accepts a list `q` of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and an integer `x`. It returns a list of integers derived from the factors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. The specific output list returned in the example is [10, 10, 5, 5, 2].
