Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `q` of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and an integer `x`. The function returns a list of integers. Based on the provided example, the function seems to process the list `q` and the integer `x` to produce a specific output list [10, 10, 5, 5, 2].**
