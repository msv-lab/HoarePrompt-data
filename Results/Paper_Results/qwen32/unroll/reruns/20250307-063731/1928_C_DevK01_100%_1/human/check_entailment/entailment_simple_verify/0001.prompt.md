You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine the number of possible values of `k` for which Vasya's position `n` and the number he received `x` during the "first–k -th" position settling are valid.

The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and within each cycle, the numbers assigned to students are:
- The first `k` students are numbered `1, 2, ..., k`.
- The next `k-2` students are numbered `k-1, k-2, ..., 2`.

### Key Observations

1. **Cycle Length**: The cycle length is `2k - 2`. This means the sequence of numbers repeats every `2k - 2` students.
2. **Position and Number Relationship**: Given position `n` and number `x`, we need to find `k` such that `x` is a valid number at position `n` according to the pattern.
3. **Constraints**: `k > 1` and `1 <= x < n <= 10^9`.

### Program Analysis

The program uses a function `func_1` to find divisors of a number `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. This function is used to determine possible values of `k` based on the given position `n` and number `x`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.

2. **Initial Check**:
   - The program calculates `y = n + x`.
   - If `y` is odd, it prints `0` because the pattern described requires `y` to be even.

3. **Finding Possible `k` Values**:
   - The program calculates `L1` using `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)`.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it adds more possible `k` values by calling `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)`.
   - It converts `L1` to a set to remove duplicates and then prints the length of this set.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function finds all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It first checks if the square root of `q` is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It then iterates through possible divisors up to the square root of `q`.

### Correctness Evaluation

The program correctly implements the logic to find possible values of `k` based on the given constraints and the pattern described. It handles the case where `y` is odd separately and uses the `func_1` function to find valid divisors. The use of a set to remove duplicate `k` values ensures that each possible `k` is counted only once.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program appears to be correct and solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
