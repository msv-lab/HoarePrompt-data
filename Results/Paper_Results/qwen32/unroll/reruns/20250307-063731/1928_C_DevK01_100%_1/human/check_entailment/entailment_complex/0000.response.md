### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step by step to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the possible values of `k` such that a given position `n` in a line corresponds to a received number `x` when the line is settled in a pattern that repeats every `2k - 2` positions. The pattern is such that the first `k` positions are `1, 2, ..., k`, followed by `k-2` positions `k-1, k-2, ..., 2`, and so on.

For a given position `n` and received number `x`, the possible `k` values can be derived from the following observations:
- The pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
- For a position `n`, the received number `x` can be determined by the position within the repeating pattern.
- The position `n` can be mapped to a position within the first `2k - 2` positions by taking `n % (2k - 2)`.
- Within the first `2k - 2` positions, the received number `x` can be at positions `x`, `2k - x`, or other positions depending on the value of `k`.

#### Code Analysis:
The code provided attempts to determine the possible values of `k` based on the given position `n` and received number `x`. Here's a detailed breakdown of the code:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the position `n` and the received number `x`.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The code calculates `y = n + x`.
   - If `y` is odd, it prints `0` because the pattern cannot fit the given position and number in such a case.
   - If `y` is even, it proceeds to find possible values of `k`.

3. **Finding Possible `k` Values:**
   - The code calls `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` to find possible `k` values based on the first part of the pattern.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it calls `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` again to find additional possible `k` values based on the second part of the pattern.
   - It combines the results from both calls and removes duplicates by converting the list to a set.
   - Finally, it prints the number of unique possible `k` values.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes two arguments: `q` and `x`.
   - It finds the factors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It returns these factors as a list.

#### Correctness of the Code:
The code logic seems to be based on the idea that the possible `k` values can be derived from the factors of certain expressions involving `n` and `x`. However, there are several issues with the code:

- **Incorrect Factor Calculation:**
  - The function `func_1` is supposed to find the correct `k` values based on the problem constraints, but the way it calculates factors and checks the conditions does not directly align with the problem's requirements.
  - The function does not correctly map the position `n` to the received number `x` within the repeating pattern.

- **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases:**
  - The code does not handle all edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is very large or when `x` is close to `n`.

- **Logical Errors:**
  - The logic for determining the possible `k` values is not fully correct. The code does not correctly account for the repeating pattern and the position within the pattern.

Given these issues, the code does not correctly determine the number of possible `k` values for the given position `n` and received number `x`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
