Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all test cases. There are a few issues with the logic and implementation:

1. The program uses a function `func_1` to find divisors of a number, but it does not correctly account for the constraints and requirements of the problem.

2. The condition `if y % 2 != 0` is not a sufficient check for the validity of `k`. The logic for determining valid `k` values needs to be more robust.

3. The program does not correctly handle the range of possible `k` values, especially for larger inputs, and does not properly account for the repeating pattern of positions.

4. The function `func_1` and its usage in the main loop need to be revised to correctly identify all possible `k` values that satisfy the conditions given in the problem.

A correct solution should carefully consider the repeating pattern of positions and the constraints on `k`, and should be able to handle the full range of input values efficiently.
