Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the code to determine if it is correct.

The problem requires us to find how many different values of k fit under the given constraints for Vasya's position (n) and the number he received (x). The settling pattern repeats every 2k - 2 positions and is defined based on the value of k.

The code starts by reading the number of test cases, t. For each test case, it reads n and x, and then checks if the sum of n and x is even. If it is not, it immediately prints 0 because a valid k cannot exist in this case (as the pattern length 2k - 2 would not align with an odd sum of n and x).

If the sum is even, the code calls `func_1` twice to find potential values of k. The first call to `func_1` is with the argument `(y - 2) // 2`, where y is the sum of n and x. The second call is with the argument `(n - x) // 2` if n is greater than or equal to 3x - 2. The purpose of `func_1` is to find divisors of the given argument that are greater than or equal to x - 1.

The `func_1` function calculates the square root of the given argument (q) and checks if it is an integer and if it is greater than or equal to x - 1. If so, it adds it to the list M. Then, it iterates from 1 to the square root of q, checking if i and q // i are divisors of q and if they are greater than or equal to x - 1. If they are, they are added to the list M. The function returns the list M, which contains all such divisors.

The main part of the code then combines the results from the two calls to `func_1`, removes duplicates by converting the list to a set, and prints the length of the resulting list, which is the number of different k values that fit under the given constraints.

The code seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It checks the necessary conditions and calculates the correct values of k using the divisors of the appropriate expressions.

Correctness: **True**
