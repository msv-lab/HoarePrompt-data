Let's analyze the given program and the problem step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Game Mechanics**:
   - Players start at given positions `P_B` and `P_S`.
   - Each turn, a player can either stay at their current position or move to the position indicated by the permutation at their current position.
   - The player's score increases by the value of the array at their current position.
   - The game lasts for `k` turns.
   - After `k` turns, the player with the higher score wins.

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine who wins the game if both players play optimally.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.

2. **Adjustments to Input**:
   - The program adjusts the indices of the permutation and array to be 0-based (subtracting 1 from each element).

3. **Scoring Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the maximum score a player can achieve starting from a given position `s` and playing for `k` turns.
   - It uses a visited array `vis` to track visited positions to prevent infinite loops.
   - It calculates the score incrementally, considering the best possible score at each step.

4. **Comparison**:
   - The program calculates the maximum scores for Bodya and Sasha using `func_1`.
   - It then compares the scores and prints the result accordingly.

### Correctness Evaluation

1. **Logic of `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly calculates the maximum score by considering the best possible score at each step.
   - It handles the case where a player might get stuck in a cycle by using the visited array `vis`.

2. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading and processing each test case independently.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as:
     - Players starting at the same position.
     - Players moving in cycles.
     - Large values of `k` (up to \(10^9\)) efficiently by stopping the loop once a cycle is detected.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. It handles all necessary cases and performs efficiently within the given constraints.

**Correctness: True**
