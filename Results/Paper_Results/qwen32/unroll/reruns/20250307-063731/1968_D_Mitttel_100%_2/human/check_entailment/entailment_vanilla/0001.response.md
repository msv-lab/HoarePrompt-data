Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`.
   - Then, it reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjustment of Indices:**
   - The program adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` by subtracting 1 from each element. This is because Python lists are 0-indexed, while the problem description provides 1-indexed inputs.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the maximum score a player can achieve starting from position `s` and making up to `k` moves.
   - It uses a `vis` (visited) list to keep track of visited positions to avoid infinite loops.
   - It calculates the score incrementally by adding `a[s]` to the current score `cur` and updating `mx` (maximum score) at each step.
   - The function stops either when `k` moves are made or when a cycle is detected (i.e., a position is revisited).

4. **Comparison of Scores:**
   - The program calculates the maximum scores for Bodya (`A`) and Sasha (`B`) using `func_1`.
   - It then compares these scores and prints "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" based on the comparison.

### Evaluation:

- **Correctness of Logic:**
  - The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum score for each player by simulating up to `k` moves and considering cycles.
  - The use of the `vis` list ensures that the program does not get stuck in infinite loops due to cycles in the permutation.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles cases where `k` is very large (`k = 10^9`) by stopping early if a cycle is detected.
  - It also handles cases where the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha are the same or different.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The program is efficient with a time complexity of O(n) per test case, which is suitable given the constraints (sum of `n` over all test cases â‰¤ 2 * 10^5).

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and efficiently computes the required scores.

Correctness: **True**
