To determine the final state of the variables after the loop finishes executing, let's break down the loop and its effects step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
- `a`: List of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9.
- `p`: List of n integers representing a permutation of indices from 1 to n.
- `s`: Tuple of two integers (P_B, P_S) where each integer is between 1 and n.
- `k`: An integer representing the number of iterations allowed, between 1 and 10^9.
- `n`: Length of the list `p`.
- `mx`: Initialized to 0.
- `cur`: Initialized to 0.
- `vis`: List of n integers initialized to 0.

### Loop Execution:
The loop continues to execute as long as `vis[s]` is 0 and `k` is greater than 0.
- `vis[s]` is set to 1, marking the current position `s` as visited.
- `mx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`.
- `cur` is incremented by `a[s]`, adding the value at the current position to the cumulative sum.
- `k` is decremented by 1, reducing the number of remaining iterations.
- `s` is updated to `p[s]`, moving to the next position according to the permutation.

### Loop Termination:
The loop terminates when either:
1. The position `s` has already been visited (`vis[s]` is 1).
2. The number of iterations `k` reaches 0.

### Final State:
- `vis[s]` will be 1 for all positions `s` that were visited during the loop.
- `mx` will hold the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during the loop.
- `cur` will hold the cumulative sum of `a[s]` for all visited positions.
- `k` will be 0 if the loop terminated due to running out of iterations, or it will be a positive number if the loop terminated because a position was revisited.
- `s` will be the last position visited before the loop terminated.

### Output State:
Given the above, the output state after the loop finishes executing is:

Output State: **`vis` is updated to mark all visited positions, `mx` holds the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]`, `cur` holds the cumulative sum of `a[s]` for all visited positions, `k` is 0 if all iterations were used or a positive number if a position was revisited, and `s` is the last visited position.**

In simpler terms, the loop updates `vis` to show which positions were visited, calculates the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered, accumulates the sum of `a[s]` for all visited positions in `cur`, decrements `k` until it reaches 0 or a position is revisited, and `s` ends up being the last position visited before the loop stops.
