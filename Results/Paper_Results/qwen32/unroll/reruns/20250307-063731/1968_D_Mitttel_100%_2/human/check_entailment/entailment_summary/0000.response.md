### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game where two players, Bodya and Sasha, move through a permutation and collect scores based on an array of values. Each player can either stay at their current position or move to a new position based on the permutation. The goal is to maximize their score after `k` turns.

**Key Points to Consider:**
1. **Game Dynamics:** Both players can choose to stay or move to a new position based on the permutation. They aim to maximize their score by choosing optimal moves.
2. **Scoring:** The score is incremented by the value of the current position in the array `a` each turn.
3. **Termination:** The game ends after `k` turns, and the player with the higher score wins. If the scores are equal, it is a draw.
4. **Cycle Detection:** Since the permutation can lead to cycles, the game may terminate early if a player revisits a position.

**Analysis of the Provided Program:**
- The program reads multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, the permutation list `p`, and the array `a`.
- The program adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` to be zero-based.
- It then calls `func_1` to calculate the maximum possible score for both players.
- `func_1` calculates the maximum score by:
  - Initializing `mx` to store the maximum score and `cur` to store the current score.
  - Using a `vis` array to track visited positions.
  - Iterating through the permutation until `k` turns are used or a position is revisited.
  - At each step, it updates the maximum score as `cur + k * a[s]` and moves to the next position based on the permutation.
- The program then compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the result.

**Evaluation:**
- The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum score by considering the score gain from staying at the current position and the potential gain from remaining turns.
- The use of a `vis` array ensures that the program handles cycles correctly.
- The program efficiently handles the constraints provided in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules and constraints.

**Correctness: **True**
