### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The input is parsed correctly, and the necessary values (n, k, pb, ps) are extracted and adjusted to fit zero-based indexing by subtracting 1 from positions and values in the arrays `a` and `p`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the maximum score a player can achieve starting from a given position `s` and making up to `k` moves.
   - It uses a `vis` list to keep track of visited positions to detect cycles.
   - The function iterates through the permutation, updating the cumulative score `cur` and calculating the potential maximum score `mx` by considering the remaining moves `k`.
   - If a cycle is detected (i.e., a position is revisited), the loop breaks, and the function returns the maximum score found.

3. **Comparison of Scores:**
   - After computing the maximum scores for both Bodya and Sasha using `func_1`, the program compares these scores and prints the appropriate result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").

4. **Handling Large Inputs:**
   - The program is designed to handle up to 10^4 test cases with a total of up to 2 * 10^5 elements in `p` and `a` across all test cases, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules and constraints. It efficiently handles the input and computes the maximum scores for both players, making the correct comparisons and outputting the appropriate results.

**Correctness: **True**
