You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), p is a list of n integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) representing a permutation, s is a tuple of two integers (P_B, P_S) where 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n, and k is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).

    #State: `vis` is updated to mark all visited positions, `mx` holds the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]`, `cur` holds the cumulative sum of `a[s]` for all visited positions, `k` is 0 if all iterations were used or a positive number if a position was revisited, and `s` is the last visited position.
    return mx
    #The program returns `mx`, which holds the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` by traversing a list `a` using a permutation list `p`, starting from an initial position `s`, and decrementing `k` until all iterations are used or a position is revisited.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`.
   - Then, it reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjustment of Indices:**
   - The program adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` by subtracting 1 from each element. This is because Python lists are 0-indexed, while the problem description provides 1-indexed inputs.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the maximum score a player can achieve starting from position `s` and making up to `k` moves.
   - It uses a `vis` (visited) list to keep track of visited positions to avoid infinite loops.
   - It calculates the score incrementally by adding `a[s]` to the current score `cur` and updating `mx` (maximum score) at each step.
   - The function stops either when `k` moves are made or when a cycle is detected (i.e., a position is revisited).

4. **Comparison of Scores:**
   - The program calculates the maximum scores for Bodya (`A`) and Sasha (`B`) using `func_1`.
   - It then compares these scores and prints "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" based on the comparison.

### Evaluation:

- **Correctness of Logic:**
  - The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum score for each player by simulating up to `k` moves and considering cycles.
  - The use of the `vis` list ensures that the program does not get stuck in infinite loops due to cycles in the permutation.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles cases where `k` is very large (`k = 10^9`) by stopping early if a cycle is detected.
  - It also handles cases where the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha are the same or different.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The program is efficient with a time complexity of O(n) per test case, which is suitable given the constraints (sum of `n` over all test cases ≤ 2 * 10^5).

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and efficiently computes the required scores.

Correctness: **True**
