You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        p[i] -= 1
        a[i] -= 1
    A = func_1(a, p, pb - 1, k)
    B = func_1(a, p, ps - 1, k)
    if A == B:
        print('Draw')
    elif A > B:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Sasha')

def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        cur += a[s]
        k -= 1
        s = p[s]
    return mx



- Function Summary: 
The function calculates and returns the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` by traversing a list `a` using a permutation list `p`, starting from an initial position `s`, and decrementing `k` until all iterations are used or a position is revisited.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program contains a critical issue in the `func_1` function, which calculates the maximum score for a player starting from a given position. The problem is in the way the score (`cur`) and the maximum score (`mx`) are being updated.

Here is the problematic part of the code:
```python
mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
cur += a[s]
k -= 1
```
The issue is that the code incorrectly assumes that the player will always stay at the current position for the remaining `k` turns to maximize the score. However, this is not necessarily true. The player could move to the next position and potentially earn more points by following the permutation path.

A correct approach would involve considering all possible paths the player can take and calculating the scores accordingly. The current implementation does not handle this correctly.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:
```
1
3 2 1 2
2 3 1
1 2 3
```
For this input, the correct output should be "Sasha" because:
- Bodya starts at position 1 and can either stay at 1 or move to position 2.
  - If Bodya stays at 1, his score after 2 turns would be `1 + 1 = 2`.
  - If Bodya moves to 2, his score after 2 turns would be `1 + 2 = 3`.
- Sasha starts at position 2 and can either stay at 2 or move to position 3.
  - If Sasha stays at 2, his score after 2 turns would be `2 + 2 = 4`.
  - If Sasha moves to 3, his score after 2 turns would be `2 + 3 = 5`.

The optimal strategy for Sasha is to move to position 3, resulting in a score of 5, while the optimal strategy for Bodya is to move to position 2, resulting in a score of 3. Thus, Sasha wins.

However, the given program might incorrectly calculate the scores and determine a different winner. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
