### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by simulating the game for both players and comparing their scores after `k` turns. Let's break down the program to see if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Indices:**
   - The program adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` to be 0-based, which is a common practice in Python to simplify array indexing.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the maximum score a player can achieve starting from a given position `s` and playing for `k` turns.
   - Inside `func_1`, it uses a while loop to simulate the player's moves:
     - It keeps track of visited positions using the `vis` array.
     - It updates the current score `cur` by adding the value of `a[s]` at each step.
     - It updates the maximum score `mx` by considering the potential score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining turns.
     - It moves to the next position according to the permutation `p`.
     - The loop continues until the player revisits a position (indicating a cycle) or runs out of turns.

4. **Comparison of Scores:**
   - The program calculates the maximum scores for Bodya and Sasha using `func_1` and compares them.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, and "Draw" if their scores are equal.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly simulates the game for each player and calculates the maximum score they can achieve.
- The use of the `vis` array ensures that cycles are detected and the loop terminates appropriately.
- The calculation of `mx` correctly considers the potential score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining turns, which is crucial for maximizing the score.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
