Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program contains a critical issue in the `func_1` function, which calculates the maximum score for a player starting from a given position. The problem is in the way the score (`cur`) and the maximum score (`mx`) are being updated.

Here is the problematic part of the code:
```python
mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
cur += a[s]
k -= 1
```
The issue is that the code incorrectly assumes that the player will always stay at the current position for the remaining `k` turns to maximize the score. However, this is not necessarily true. The player could move to the next position and potentially earn more points by following the permutation path.

A correct approach would involve considering all possible paths the player can take and calculating the scores accordingly. The current implementation does not handle this correctly.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:
```
1
3 2 1 2
2 3 1
1 2 3
```
For this input, the correct output should be "Sasha" because:
- Bodya starts at position 1 and can either stay at 1 or move to position 2.
  - If Bodya stays at 1, his score after 2 turns would be `1 + 1 = 2`.
  - If Bodya moves to 2, his score after 2 turns would be `1 + 2 = 3`.
- Sasha starts at position 2 and can either stay at 2 or move to position 3.
  - If Sasha stays at 2, his score after 2 turns would be `2 + 2 = 4`.
  - If Sasha moves to 3, his score after 2 turns would be `2 + 3 = 5`.

The optimal strategy for Sasha is to move to position 3, resulting in a score of 5, while the optimal strategy for Bodya is to move to position 2, resulting in a score of 3. Thus, Sasha wins.

However, the given program might incorrectly calculate the scores and determine a different winner. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
