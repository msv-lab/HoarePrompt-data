The code snippet provided initializes a variable `cur` to 0. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state. The other variables `a`, `p`, `s`, `k`, `n`, and `mx` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `p` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) representing a permutation, `s` is a tuple of two integers (P_B, P_S) where 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n, and `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9); `n` is the length of the list `p`; `mx` is 0; `cur` is 0.**
