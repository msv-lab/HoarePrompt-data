### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Input Parsing and Index Adjustment:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
- It adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` by subtracting 1 from each element, converting them from 1-based to 0-based indexing, which is appropriate for Python.

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` calculates the maximum score a player can achieve starting from position `s` and making up to `k` moves.
- It uses a `vis` (visited) list to keep track of visited positions to avoid infinite loops.
- The variable `cur` keeps track of the cumulative score up to the current position.
- The variable `mx` keeps track of the maximum score that can be achieved, considering the remaining moves `k`.
- The function updates `vis[s]` to mark the current position as visited, then updates `mx` with the maximum score considering the remaining moves `k`, adds `a[s]` to `cur`, decrements `k`, and moves to the next position `p[s]`.
- The loop terminates when a cycle is detected (`vis[s]` is already 1) or when `k` moves are made.

#### Comparison of Scores:
- The program calculates the maximum scores for Bodya (`A`) and Sasha (`B`) using `func_1`.
- It then compares these scores and prints "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" based on the comparison.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations describe the state of the program before and after key operations, including the state of the `vis` list, `mx`, `cur`, `k`, and `s` at each step.
- The annotations confirm that the program correctly tracks the visited positions and calculates the maximum score considering the remaining moves.

#### Evaluation:
- The logic of the program is correct. It correctly handles cycles and efficiently computes the maximum score for each player.
- The program handles edge cases such as very large values of `k` by stopping early if a cycle is detected.
- The time complexity of the program is O(n) per test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

#### Final Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and efficiently computes the required scores.

### Final: **True**
