The provided code snippet reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This does not affect the variables `n`, `k`, or `adj` in any way. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, and `adj` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, `adj` is a list of lists where `adj[i]` contains the vertices adjacent to vertex `i` in the tree, `t` is an integer read from the standard input.**
