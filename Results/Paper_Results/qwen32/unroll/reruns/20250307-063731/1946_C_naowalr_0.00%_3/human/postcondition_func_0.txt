The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a tree defined by the number of vertices `n`, the number of edges to be removed `k`, and the adjacency list `adj`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of vertices that can remain in the largest connected component after removing exactly `k` edges from the tree.
