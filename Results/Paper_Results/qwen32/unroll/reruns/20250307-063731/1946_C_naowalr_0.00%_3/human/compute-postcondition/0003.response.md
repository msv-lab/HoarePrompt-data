Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree), `k` (an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n), and `adj` (a list of lists where `adj[i]` contains the vertices adjacent to vertex `i` in the tree). The function returns the resulting configuration of the tree after removing `k` edges, which could be described in terms of the connected components of the tree or the structure of the remaining graph.**
