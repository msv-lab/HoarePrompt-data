To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the loop condition. The loop condition is `while t:`, which means the loop will execute as long as `t` is not zero.

Given the state right before the loop: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`. The values of `n` and `k` and the subsequent lines containing `r_i` and `c_i` do not affect the execution of the first iteration of the `while` loop directly.

Since `t` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 10^4, it will always be a non-zero value, ensuring that the loop can execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustment to the state is necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`. Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n` and 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
