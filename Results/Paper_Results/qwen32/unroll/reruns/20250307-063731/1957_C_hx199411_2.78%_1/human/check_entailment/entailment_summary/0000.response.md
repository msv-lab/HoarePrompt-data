### Reasoning:

The program aims to compute the number of different final configurations of rooks on an \(n \times n\) chessboard after \(k\) moves, where the moves are given and the subsequent moves follow specific rules. The function processes each test case by:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - It reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) (the size of the chessboard) and \(k\) (the number of initial moves).
   - It then reads the \(k\) moves, each consisting of a row and column index.

2. **Processing Moves:**
   - It iterates through the \(k\) moves and counts the number of moves where the row and column are the same (`c == r`), and those where they are different (`c != r`).
   - Moves where `c == r` are counted as `num += 1` because they result in the computer skipping its turn.
   - Moves where `c != r` are counted as `num += 2` because they result in both the player and the computer making a move.

3. **Calculating Remaining Moves:**
   - It calculates `m = n - num`, which represents the number of remaining positions where rooks can be placed without attacking each other.
   - If `m == 0`, there are no valid configurations, so it prints 0.
   - If `m == 1`, there is exactly one valid configuration, so it prints 1.

4. **Dynamic Programming to Calculate Configurations:**
   - For `m > 1`, it uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to place the remaining rooks.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The DP relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is used to compute the number of configurations for `i` remaining positions.
   - This relation is derived from the fact that for each new position, the rook can be placed in a new position independently (thus `dp[i-1]` ways) or it can be placed in a position that affects a previously placed rook (thus `(i-1) * dp[i-2] * 2` ways, considering the two possible colors).

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the result for each test case modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. The dynamic programming approach ensures that the number of configurations is calculated efficiently, and the modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

### Correctness: **True**
