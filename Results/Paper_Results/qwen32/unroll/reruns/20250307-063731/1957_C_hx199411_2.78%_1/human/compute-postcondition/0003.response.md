Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the size of the grid and an integer `k` representing the number of moves. It then accepts `k` pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)` representing the row and column of each move. The function returns a result for each test case based on the moves made on the grid.**
