Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the calculation of the number of possible final configurations. Specifically, the dynamic programming (DP) approach used in the program is incorrect.

The program uses a DP array to calculate the number of ways to place rooks, but the transition formula used in the loop:

```python
dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

is not correct for this problem. The problem requires counting the number of ways to place rooks on an \( n \times n \) board such that no two rooks attack each other, and considering the mirroring rules specified in the problem statement.

A correct approach would involve combinatorial counting and careful handling of the mirroring rules. The DP transition needs to correctly reflect the constraints of placing rooks and the mirroring rule, which the current implementation does not do.

In summary, the current implementation does not correctly count the number of valid configurations, and thus the program is incorrect.
