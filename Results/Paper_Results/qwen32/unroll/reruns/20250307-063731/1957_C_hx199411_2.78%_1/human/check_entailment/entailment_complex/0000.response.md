### Reasoning:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by calculating the number of valid final configurations of rooks on an \(n \times n\) chessboard after \(k\) moves, considering the rules of the game.

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard \(n\) and the number of moves \(k\).
   - It then reads \(k\) pairs of integers \((r_i, c_i)\) representing the moves made.

2. **Counting Mirror Moves and Diagonal Moves:**
   - The code initializes `num` to 0, which will count the number of moves that either result in a diagonal move (where \(r_i = c_i\)) or a mirrored move.
   - For each move \((r_i, c_i)\), if \(r_i = c_i\), it increments `num` by 1 (since the computer skips its turn).
   - Otherwise, it increments `num` by 2 (one for the player's move and one for the computer's mirrored move).

3. **Calculating Remaining Moves:**
   - The code calculates `m` as \(n - \text{num}\), which represents the number of rows and columns that are still available for placing rooks without conflict.

4. **Dynamic Programming for Counting Configurations:**
   - If `m` is 0, there are no valid configurations, so it prints 0.
   - If `m` is 1, there is only one way to place a rook, so it prints 1.
   - For larger values of `m`, it uses dynamic programming:
     - `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks on `i` available rows/columns.
     - It initializes `dp[1]` to 1 and `dp[2]` to 3 (since there are 3 ways to place rooks on 2 available rows/columns).
     - For `i` from 3 to `m`, it calculates `dp[i]` using the recurrence relation \(dp[i] = dp[i-1] + (i-1) \times dp[i-2] \times 2\). This relation considers placing a rook in one row and then calculating the number of ways to place the remaining rooks in the remaining rows/columns.

5. **Output:**
   - For each test case, it prints the value of `dp[m]` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Issues:
- The annotated state in the comments indicates that the output for the first and second test cases is `1`, which is incorrect based on the problem description and the provided example output.
- The provided example output for the first test case is `3`, not `1`. This indicates that there is an issue with the logic in the code, particularly in the dynamic programming part.
- The dynamic programming relation used in the code might not be correctly capturing all possible configurations.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly calculate the number of valid final configurations for all test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
