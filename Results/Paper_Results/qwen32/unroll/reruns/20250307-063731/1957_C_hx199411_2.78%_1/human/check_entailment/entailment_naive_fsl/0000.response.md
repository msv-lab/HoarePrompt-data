Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the number of valid final configurations of the chessboard after `k` moves. However, there are several issues with the code that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `num`:**
   - The variable `num` is intended to count the number of positions that are already occupied by rooks after `k` moves and their corresponding mirrored moves.
   - The code increments `num` by 1 if the move is on the diagonal (`c == r`), and by 2 otherwise. This is incorrect because:
     - If `c == r`, the computer skips its turn, so `num` should only be incremented by 1.
     - If `c != r`, both the move and its mirror are valid and occupy different positions, so `num` should be incremented by 2, which is correct.
   - However, the logic for `num` is flawed because it doesn't account for the fact that the computer's move can also block positions on the board. Specifically, if the computer places a rook at `(c, r)` (when `c != r`), it blocks both `(c, r)` and `(r, c)`.

2. **Incorrect DP Transition:**
   - The DP transition formula used in the code:
     ```python
     dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
     ```
     is incorrect. The formula does not correctly account for the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining positions.
   - The correct approach involves considering the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining rows and columns, taking into account the already occupied positions.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle cases where `n` is very large and `k` is 0. In such cases, the number of configurations can be very large, and the DP approach should be able to handle it efficiently.
   - The code does not handle cases where `n` is small and `k` is close to `n`, which might require more careful handling of the remaining positions.

### Example of Incorrectness:

Consider the following test case:
```
1
4 2
1 2
2 3
```
- After the first move `(1, 2)`, the computer places a rook at `(2, 1)`.
- After the second move `(2, 3)`, the computer places a rook at `(3, 2)`.
- The board now looks like this:
  ```
  . W . .
  B . W .
  . B . .
  . . . .
  ```
- The remaining positions are `(1, 3)`, `(1, 4)`, `(3, 1)`, `(3, 4)`, `(4, 1)`, and `(4, 3)`.
- The correct number of configurations is 15, but the provided code will not produce this result due to the incorrect logic for `num` and the incorrect DP transition formula.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the problem requirements for all potential cases, particularly in the calculation of `num` and the DP transition formula. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
