You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a grid of size `n` and a series of `k` moves specified by row and column indices. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on the grid after accounting for the moves, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have an `n x n` chessboard.
   - Players take turns placing rooks (White and Black) such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - You start first, and for each move you make, the computer mirrors your move unless `r == c`.
   - You need to determine the number of different final configurations after `k` moves, considering the constraints and the mirroring rules.

2. **Interpreting the Input:**
   - For each test case, we are given `n` (size of the board) and `k` (number of moves you have already made).
   - For each of the `k` moves, we are given the coordinates `(r, c)` where you placed a rook.

3. **Computing the Number of Moves:**
   - For each move `(r, c)`, if `r == c`, the computer skips its turn, so we increment `num` by 1.
   - If `r != c`, the computer mirrors the move, so we increment `num` by 2.
   - `num` represents the total number of rooks placed on the board after `k` moves.

4. **Calculating Remaining Empty Spots:**
   - `m = n - num` represents the number of empty spots left on the board after placing `num` rooks.
   - If `m == 0`, there are no more moves possible, so the number of configurations is 0.
   - If `m == 1`, there is only one way to place the last rook, so the number of configurations is 1.

5. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - We use dynamic programming to calculate the number of configurations for `m` empty spots.
   - `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place `i` rooks on `i` spots such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - The base cases are `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - For `i >= 3`, the recurrence relation is `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + (i-1) * dp[i-2] * 2` (considering the placement of the `i-th` rook in different positions).

6. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Since the result can be large, we take the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

The provided program correctly implements the described approach to solve the problem. It handles all edge cases and constraints as per the problem statement.
