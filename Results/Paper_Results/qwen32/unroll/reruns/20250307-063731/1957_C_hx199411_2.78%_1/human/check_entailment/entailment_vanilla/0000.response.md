### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have an `n x n` chessboard.
   - Players take turns placing rooks (White and Black) such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - You start first, and for each move you make, the computer mirrors your move unless `r == c`.
   - You need to determine the number of different final configurations after `k` moves, considering the constraints and the mirroring rules.

2. **Interpreting the Input:**
   - For each test case, we are given `n` (size of the board) and `k` (number of moves you have already made).
   - For each of the `k` moves, we are given the coordinates `(r, c)` where you placed a rook.

3. **Computing the Number of Moves:**
   - For each move `(r, c)`, if `r == c`, the computer skips its turn, so we increment `num` by 1.
   - If `r != c`, the computer mirrors the move, so we increment `num` by 2.
   - `num` represents the total number of rooks placed on the board after `k` moves.

4. **Calculating Remaining Empty Spots:**
   - `m = n - num` represents the number of empty spots left on the board after placing `num` rooks.
   - If `m == 0`, there are no more moves possible, so the number of configurations is 0.
   - If `m == 1`, there is only one way to place the last rook, so the number of configurations is 1.

5. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - We use dynamic programming to calculate the number of configurations for `m` empty spots.
   - `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place `i` rooks on `i` spots such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - The base cases are `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - For `i >= 3`, the recurrence relation is `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + (i-1) * dp[i-2] * 2` (considering the placement of the `i-th` rook in different positions).

6. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Since the result can be large, we take the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.
