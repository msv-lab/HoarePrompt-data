Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a grid of size `n` and a series of `k` moves specified by row and column indices. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on the grid after accounting for the moves, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).**
