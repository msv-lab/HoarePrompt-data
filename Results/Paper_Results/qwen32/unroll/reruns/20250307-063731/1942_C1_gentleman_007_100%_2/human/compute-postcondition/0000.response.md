The code snippet `q = deque()` reassigns the variable `q` to a new empty deque, effectively clearing any previous elements that `q` might have contained. The other variables (`ver`, `vis`, and `graph`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `q` is an empty deque, `vis` is a list or dictionary used to keep track of visited vertices, and `graph` is a data structure (likely a dictionary or list of lists) representing the adjacency list of the graph.**
