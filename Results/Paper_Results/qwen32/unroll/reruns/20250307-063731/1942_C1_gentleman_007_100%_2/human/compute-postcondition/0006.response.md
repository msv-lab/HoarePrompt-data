Functionality: **The function `func_25` accepts a parameter `ver`, which is an integer representing a vertex in the graph. It also implicitly uses a deque `q` for breadth-first search (BFS), a list or dictionary `vis` to keep track of visited vertices, and a data structure `graph` representing the adjacency list of the graph. The function performs a BFS starting from the vertex `ver`, marking vertices as visited, and returns the result of the BFS traversal.**
