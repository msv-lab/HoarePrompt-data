The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `m`, where `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon and `m` represents the number of edges or connections. It returns a 2D list `l` of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` where `m` pairs of elements are set to `1` at positions `(x, y)` and `(y, x)` as determined by `func_1()`. All other elements in the list are `0`.
