The function accepts a 2D list `l` of integers and returns a 2D list `p` which is a prefix sum matrix. In this matrix, each element `p[i][j]` represents the sum of all elements in the submatrix of `l` from the top-left corner (0,0) to the position (i-1,j-1). All other elements in `p` (i.e., `p[0][j]` and `p[i][0]` for all valid `i` and `j`) are `0`.
