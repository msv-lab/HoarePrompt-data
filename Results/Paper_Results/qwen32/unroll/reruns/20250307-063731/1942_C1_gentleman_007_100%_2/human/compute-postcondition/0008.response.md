Output State: **The program returns the reversed LCS of a and b**

Explanation: Since `s` is defined as the LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) of `a` and `b`, and the code returns `s[::-1]`, the program returns the reversed version of the LCS of `a` and `b`. Given that `l` is the reversed LCS of `a` and `b`, the program essentially returns `l`.
