Correctness: **False**

The provided program includes a large number of functions, but none of them seem to address the problem of finding the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed from the given vertices of a regular polygon. The problem requires a specific algorithm to determine how many triangles can be formed using the selected vertices, and the given code does not implement such an algorithm.

To solve the problem, you would typically need to:
1. Sort the chosen vertices.
2. Use a greedy approach or a combinatorial method to count the number of triangles that can be formed by connecting these vertices with non-intersecting diagonals.

The provided code does not contain any logic to achieve this. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem.
