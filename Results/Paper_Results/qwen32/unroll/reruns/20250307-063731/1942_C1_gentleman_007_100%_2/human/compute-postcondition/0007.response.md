Functionality: **The function `func_25` performs a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from a given vertex `ver` in a graph. It prints all vertices reachable from `ver` in the order they are visited and marks these vertices as visited in the `vis` list or dictionary. Upon completion, the deque `q` is empty, and all reachable vertices have been processed.**
