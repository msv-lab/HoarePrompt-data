The code snippet `vis[ver] = 1` sets the value of the entry in the `vis` list or dictionary corresponding to the vertex `ver` to 1, indicating that the vertex `ver` has been visited. The other variables (`q`, `graph`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `q` is a deque containing the vertex `ver`, `vis` is a list or dictionary used to keep track of visited vertices with `vis[ver]` set to 1, and `graph` is a data structure (likely a dictionary or list of lists) representing the adjacency list of the graph.**
