### Reasoning:

The provided Python code is intended to solve a problem where you need to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by drawing diagonals between chosen vertices of a regular polygon. The key part of the code that performs this calculation is the main loop that processes each test case:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = x - 2
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    arr.sort()
    for i in range(1, x):
        if arr[i - 1] + 2 == arr[i]:
            ans += 1
    if arr[x - 1] == n - 1 and arr[0] == 1:
        ans += 1
    if arr[x - 1] == n and arr[0] == 2:
        ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
1. **Initialization**: For each test case, the number of sides of the polygon (`n`), the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (`x`), and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose (`y`) are read.
2. **Answer Initialization**: The initial answer is set to `x - 2` because if you have `x` vertices, you can form at least `x - 2` triangles if they are all consecutive.
3. **Reading and Sorting Vertices**: The vertices Bessie has chosen are read and sorted.
4. **Counting Consecutive Vertices**: The code then iterates through the sorted list of vertices and checks for consecutive vertices (i.e., vertices that are two units apart in the sorted list). For each such pair, it increments the answer by 1.
5. **Handling Circular Cases**: The code also checks if the first and last vertices in the sorted list form a valid triangle with the last and first vertices of the polygon, respectively. If they do, it increments the answer by 1.

### Analysis of Provided Functions:

The provided functions (`func_1` to `func_25`) are not directly used in the main logic of the program. They seem to be utility functions that might be useful for other problems or parts of the code that are not shown. However, they do not affect the correctness of the main logic for this specific problem.

### Conclusion:

The main logic of the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided examples. The program correctly counts the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed given the constraints and examples provided.

**Correctness: True**
