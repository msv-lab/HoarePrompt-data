You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ver is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, q is a deque (double-ended queue) used for breadth-first search (BFS), vis is a list or dictionary used to keep track of visited vertices, and graph is a data structure (likely a dictionary or list of lists) representing the adjacency list of the graph.
def func_25(ver):
    q = deque()
    q.append(ver)
    vis[ver] = 1
    while len(q):
        ver = q.popleft()
        
        print(ver, end=' ')
        
        for node in graph[ver]:
            if not vis[node]:
                q.append(node)
                vis[node] = 1
        
    #State: q is an empty deque, vis has 1s for all vertices that were reachable from the initial ver, and all reachable vertices have been printed in the order they were visited.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_25` accepts a parameter `ver`, which is an integer representing a vertex in the graph. It also implicitly uses a deque `q` for breadth-first search (BFS), a list or dictionary `vis` to keep track of visited vertices, and a data structure `graph` representing the adjacency list of the graph. The function performs a BFS starting from the vertex `ver`, marking vertices as visited, and returns the result of the BFS traversal.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
