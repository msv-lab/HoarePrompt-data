The function accepts an integer `num` greater than 1 and a list or array `Prime_array` where `Prime_array[i]` is the smallest prime factor of `i` for all `i` from 2 to `num`. It returns a dictionary containing the prime factors of `num` as keys and their counts as values. If `num` is reduced to 1, the dictionary will be empty, indicating that 1 has no prime factors.
