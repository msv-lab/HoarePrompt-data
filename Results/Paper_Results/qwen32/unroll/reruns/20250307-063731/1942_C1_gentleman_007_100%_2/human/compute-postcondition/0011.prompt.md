You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, and mod is an integer where mod can be -1 or any other integer value.
def func_16(n, mod):
    if (mod == -1) :
        dearr = [1, 0]
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            dearr.append((i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2]))
            
        #State: `n` is a positive integer, `mod` is -1, `dearr` is a list starting with `[1, 0]` and followed by values calculated using the formula `(i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2])` for `i` from 2 to `n`.
    else :
        dearr = [1, 0]
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            dearr.append((i - 1) % mod * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2]) % mod % mod)
            
        #State: `dearr` is a list of length `n + 1` starting with `[1, 0]` and followed by values calculated by the loop formula.
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, and `mod` is an integer where `mod` can be -1 or any other integer value. `dearr` is a list of length `n + 1` starting with `[1, 0]`. If `mod` is -1, the remaining values in `dearr` are calculated using the formula `(i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2])` for `i` from 2 to `n`. Otherwise, the remaining values in `dearr` are calculated using a different loop formula.
    return dearr
    #The program returns the list `dearr` of length `n + 1`, starting with `[1, 0]`, where each subsequent element is calculated using the formula `(i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2])` for `i` from 2 to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer, and `mod`, which is an integer that can be -1 or any other integer value. The function returns a list `dearr` of length `n + 1`, starting with `[1, 0]`. Each subsequent element in the list is calculated using the formula `(i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2])` for `i` ranging from 2 to `n`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `dearr` of length `n + 1`, starting with `[1, 0]`, where each subsequent element is calculated using the formula `(i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2])` for `i` from 2 to `n`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
