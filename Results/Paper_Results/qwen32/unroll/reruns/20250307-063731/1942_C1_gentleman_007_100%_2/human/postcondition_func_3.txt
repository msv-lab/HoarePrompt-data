The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of sides of a polygon, where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `m` (an integer representing the number of vertices chosen, where 2 ≤ m ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)), and `v` (a value to populate a 2D list). It returns a 2D list with dimensions n by m, where each element in the list is the value `v`.
