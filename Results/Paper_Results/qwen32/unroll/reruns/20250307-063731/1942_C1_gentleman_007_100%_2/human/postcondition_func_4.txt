The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of sides of a polygon, and `m`, an integer representing the number of edges to be added. It returns a list `l` containing `n + 1` sublists, where each sublist at index `i` contains all vertices directly connected to vertex `i` by an edge.
