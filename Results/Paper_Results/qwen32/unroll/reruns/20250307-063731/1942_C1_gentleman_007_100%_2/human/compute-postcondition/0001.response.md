Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `q` is a deque containing the vertex `ver`, `vis` is a list or dictionary used to keep track of visited vertices, and `graph` is a data structure (likely a dictionary or list of lists) representing the adjacency list of the graph.**

In natural language: The vertex `ver` has been added to the deque `q`, while `vis` and `graph` remain unchanged.
