Output State: **q is an empty deque, vis has 1s for all vertices that were reachable from the initial ver, and all reachable vertices have been printed in the order they were visited.**

In natural language: After the loop finishes executing, the deque `q` will be empty because all vertices that were reachable from the initial vertex `ver` have been processed and removed from the deque. The `vis` list or dictionary will have the value `1` for all vertices that were reachable from the starting vertex `ver`, indicating that they have been visited. Additionally, all the reachable vertices will have been printed in the order they were visited during the execution of the loop. The state of any other variables not mentioned in the loop head and body remains unchanged.
