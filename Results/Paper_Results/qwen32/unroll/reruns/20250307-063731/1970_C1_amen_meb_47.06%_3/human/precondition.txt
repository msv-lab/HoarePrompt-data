n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers (u_1) representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, with 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n.
