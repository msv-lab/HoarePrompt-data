You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 \(\leq\) n \(\leq\) 2 \(\times\) 10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 \(\leq\) u, v \(\leq\) n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 \(\leq\) u_i \(\leq\) n, representing the starting node for each round.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Functionality**: The provided program does not implement the logic to simulate the game and determine the winner based on the number of moves Ron and Hermione can make. Instead, it reads input in a loop until it encounters a line with a different number of elements, which is not the expected behavior for this problem.

2. **Lack of Game Logic**: The program does not simulate the game on the tree structure. It does not calculate the number of moves each player can make starting from the given initial node. Instead, it simply compares two numbers (`num_1` and `num_2`) from the input, which are not defined in the problem context.

3. **Input Handling**: The program reads input in a loop, which is not suitable for the problem. The problem specifies a clear input format, including the number of nodes, edges, and the starting node, which should be handled appropriately.

4. **Output**: The program outputs "Ron" or "Hermione" based on a comparison that does not reflect the game logic. The correct output should be determined by simulating the game and counting the number of moves each player can make.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Parse the input to get the tree structure and the starting node.
- Simulate the game by counting the number of moves each player can make starting from the given node.
- Determine the winner based on the number of moves each player can make.

Here is an outline of what the correct program should do:

1. Parse the number of nodes and edges.
2. Build the tree using adjacency lists.
3. Identify the two leaves of the tree.
4. For each starting node, simulate the game by counting the number of moves each player can make.
5. Determine the winner based on the number of moves.
6. Output the winner.

Since the current program does not implement any of these steps correctly, it is incorrect.
