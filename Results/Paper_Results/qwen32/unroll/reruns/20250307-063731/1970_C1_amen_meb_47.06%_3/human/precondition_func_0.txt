n is an integer such that 2 \(\leq\) n \(\leq\) 2 \(\times\) 10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 \(\leq\) u, v \(\leq\) n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 \(\leq\) u_i \(\leq\) n, representing the starting node for each round.
