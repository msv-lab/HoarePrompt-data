In this case, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute at least once regardless of the current state of the program. Since the condition is always `True`, no modifications to the program state are necessary to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `numbers` is an empty list.**
