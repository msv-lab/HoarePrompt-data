In the given task, the for loop will execute based on the value read from `sys.stdin.readline()`. The loop head involves the underscore `_` (which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use) and the result of `int(sys.stdin.readline())`. The underscore does not need any specific state adjustment since it's not used within the loop body. However, the value that `sys.stdin.readline()` reads must be a positive integer for the loop to execute at least once.

Given that no variables are present in the function signature of `func_1()`, and the only dynamic element is the input from `sys.stdin.readline()`, we need to ensure that the input is a positive integer.

State: **The input to `sys.stdin.readline()` must be a positive integer**.
