To determine the output state, let's break down the given code snippet. The loop is defined as follows:

```python
for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):
    solve()
```

Here, the loop iterates a number of times specified by the integer read from standard input. The loop variable `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we do not intend to use. Inside the loop, the function `solve()` is called repeatedly.

Given that there are no variables in the function signature of `func_1()` and no other variables mentioned in the initial state, the only thing that changes during the execution of the loop is the number of times `solve()` is called, which is determined by the input.

Since the initial state does not include any variables, and the loop does not modify any variables outside its local scope, the output state will still not have any variables explicitly defined in the initial context.

Thus, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **No variables are present in the function signature of `func_1()`.**
