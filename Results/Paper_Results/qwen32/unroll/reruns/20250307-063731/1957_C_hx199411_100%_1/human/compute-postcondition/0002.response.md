To determine the output state, we need to understand how the provided code processes the input and computes the output for each test case.

Here's a breakdown of the code:
1. **Input Handling**: The code reads `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and `k` moves. Each move is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`.
2. **Logic for Each Test Case**:
   - It initializes a counter `num` to zero.
   - For each move, it increments `num` by 1 if the move is on the main diagonal (`r_i == c_i`), otherwise, it increments `num` by 2.
   - It calculates `m` as `n - num`.
   - If `m` is 0 or 1, it prints 1.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of ways to arrange `m` non-diagonal moves using dynamic programming. The state `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to arrange `i` non-diagonal moves, and it uses the relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.

The output state will be a series of numbers, each corresponding to the result of one test case.

Since the problem doesn't specify particular values for `t`, `n`, and `k`, we can't compute a specific output state without concrete input values. However, we can describe the output state in terms of the given inputs.

### Example Walkthrough
Let's consider an example input to illustrate the output state:
- **Input**: `t = 2`
  - **Test Case 1**: `n = 3`, `k = 2`, moves: `(1, 1)`, `(2, 3)`
  - **Test Case 2**: `n = 4`, `k = 1`, move: `(1, 2)`

**Processing**:
- **Test Case 1**:
  - `num = 1 + 2 = 3`
  - `m = 3 - 3 = 0`
  - Since `m = 0`, the output is `1`.
- **Test Case 2**:
  - `num = 2`
  - `m = 4 - 2 = 2`
  - `dp[1] = 1`, `dp[2] = 3`
  - The output is `dp[2] = 3`.

**Output State**: **1 3**

### General Output State
The output state will be a series of numbers, each corresponding to the result of one test case. The exact numbers depend on the specific values of `n`, `k`, and the moves for each test case.

Output State: **the output state you calculate.**

In natural language, the output state is a sequence of integers where each integer corresponds to the result of one test case based on the given logic and input values. Each integer is either `1` if `m` is 0 or 1, or the result of the dynamic programming calculation if `m` is greater than 1.
