### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided solution and the annotations to ensure that the logic and implementation are correct.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Game Setup**: Players place rooks on an n x n chessboard. The player places white rooks, and the computer places black rooks. Rooks cannot attack each other (same row or column).
- **Initial Moves**: The player has already made k moves, and the computer has mirrored these moves where possible.
- **Objective**: Determine the number of different final configurations possible after the initial k moves until no more valid moves can be made.

#### Solution Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**: The solution correctly reads the number of test cases, the size of the chessboard, and the number of initial moves.
2. **Counting Moves**:
   - For each move, if the move is on the diagonal (`r == c`), it increments `num` by 1.
   - If the move is not on the diagonal, it increments `num` by 2.
   - This is because a diagonal move blocks one position, while a non-diagonal move blocks two positions (one row and one column).
3. **Calculating Remaining Positions**: The number of remaining positions `m` is calculated as `n - num`.
   - If `m` is 0 or 1, there is only 1 possible configuration.
4. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - For `m > 1`, a DP table is used to calculate the number of configurations.
   - The DP table is initialized with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The DP relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is used to fill the table.

#### Validation with Annotations:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
- The logic for counting moves and calculating remaining positions seems accurate.
- The DP relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` appears to correctly account for the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions.

#### Testing with Example:
Let's consider the first test case from the example:
- **Input**: `n = 4`, `k = 1`, move: `(1, 2)`
- **Processing**:
  - `num = 2` (since the move is not on the diagonal).
  - `m = 4 - 2 = 2`.
  - `dp[1] = 1`, `dp[2] = 3`.
  - Output: `3`, which matches the expected result.

#### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic for counting the number of possible configurations based on the remaining positions on the board. The dynamic programming approach is correctly formulated to account for the constraints and the problem requirements. The annotations provide a clear and accurate description of the program's behavior.

### Final Evaluation:
