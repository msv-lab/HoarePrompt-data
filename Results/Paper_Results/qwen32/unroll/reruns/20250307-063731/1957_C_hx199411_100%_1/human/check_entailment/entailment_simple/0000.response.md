### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem of determining the number of possible final configurations of a chessboard after a series of moves, given the rules for placing rooks. Let's break down the logic and correctness of the program.

#### Key Points:
1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played.
   - It then reads the `k` moves, where each move is a pair `(r_i, c_i)` representing the position where a white rook was placed.

2. **Processing Moves:**
   - For each move `(r_i, c_i)`, the program checks if `r_i == c_i`. If true, it increments a counter `num` by 1. This is because such a move cannot be mirrored by the computer.
   - If `r_i != c_i`, it increments `num` by 2. This accounts for the fact that the computer will mirror the move, effectively placing two rooks on the board.

3. **Calculating Remaining Positions:**
   - After processing all moves, `m` is calculated as `n - num`, representing the number of remaining positions on the board where rooks can be placed without attacking each other.

4. **Dynamic Programming for Configurations:**
   - If `m` is 0 or 1, the program directly prints 1, as there is only one possible configuration.
   - For `m > 1`, the program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations. The DP array `dp` is initialized with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The recurrence relation used is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. This relation is derived from the problem's constraints and ensures that all possible configurations are counted modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Output:**
   - The final result for each test case is printed as `dp[m]`.

#### Correctness Analysis:
- The logic for processing moves and calculating `m` is correct according to the problem description.
- The dynamic programming approach correctly accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions.
- The use of modulo \(10^9 + 7\) ensures that the result fits within the constraints and avoids overflow.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It handles all edge cases appropriately and uses efficient dynamic programming to compute the number of possible configurations.

**Correctness: True**
