To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute its first iteration, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop statement. The loop is defined as:

```python
while t:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute as long as `t` is truthy. In Python, any non-zero integer is considered truthy, and zero is considered falsy. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than zero.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

Since `t` is already defined to be within the range 1 to 10^4, it is guaranteed to be greater than zero. Thus, no adjustments are needed to ensure the loop executes its first iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ `r_i`, `c_i` ≤ `n`. It is guaranteed that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
