The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and `k`, and `k` pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the pairs. The result is derived from a dynamic programming approach that considers the number of moves and their positions.
