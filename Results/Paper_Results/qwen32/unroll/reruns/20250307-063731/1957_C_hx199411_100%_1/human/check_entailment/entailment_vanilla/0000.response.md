Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Game Setup**: 
   - We have an n x n chessboard.
   - Players place rooks on the board, with the player placing white rooks and the computer placing black rooks.
   - Rooks cannot attack each other, meaning no two rooks can be in the same row or column.
   - The computer mirrors the player's moves unless the move is on the diagonal (r = c), in which case the computer skips its turn.

2. **Initial Moves**: 
   - The player has already made k moves.
   - The computer has mirrored these moves where possible.

3. **Objective**: 
   - Determine the number of different final configurations possible after the initial k moves until no more valid moves can be made.
   - Output the result modulo 10^9+7.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution attempts to solve the problem by:
1. **Reading Input**: 
   - It reads the number of test cases (t).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard (n) and the number of moves already made (k).
   - It then reads the k moves made by the player.

2. **Counting Moves**:
   - It counts the number of moves on the diagonal (`num += 1`) and the number of moves not on the diagonal (`num += 2`).
   - This count helps in determining how many positions are still available for placing rooks.

3. **Calculating Remaining Positions**:
   - The number of remaining positions (`m`) is calculated as `n - num`.
   - If `m` is 0 or 1, there is only 1 possible configuration.

4. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - For `m > 1`, it uses a dynamic programming (DP) table to calculate the number of configurations.
   - The DP table is initialized with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The DP relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is used to fill the table.
   - This relation seems to account for the fact that for each new position, we can place a rook in two ways (either in the current row or column) and the remaining positions can be filled in `dp[i - 2]` ways.

### Correctness of the Solution

The provided solution seems to correctly implement the logic for counting the number of possible configurations based on the remaining positions on the board. The dynamic programming approach appears to be correctly formulated to account for the constraints and the problem requirements.

Given the problem constraints and the provided solution, the logic seems sound and the implementation appears to be correct.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **True**
