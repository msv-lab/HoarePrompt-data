Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of possible final configurations for every potential case. Specifically, the dynamic programming approach used in the code does not accurately model the problem's constraints and requirements.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Dynamic Programming Transition**: The transition in the dynamic programming (DP) array is incorrect. The current DP transition logic `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` does not correctly account for the placement of rooks on the chessboard. The problem involves placing rooks such that no two rooks attack each other, and the transitions need to consider the remaining available rows and columns for placing rooks.

2. **Base Cases**: The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` might be correct for specific small cases, but the general transition logic is flawed and does not scale correctly for larger values of `m`.

3. **Handling of Diagonal Moves**: The code handles diagonal moves (`c == r`) correctly by incrementing `num` by 1. However, for non-diagonal moves, it increments `num` by 2, which is not necessarily correct. Each non-diagonal move reduces the number of available positions for future moves by 2 (one for the white rook and one for the black rook), but the exact way to compute the number of configurations is more complex.

4. **General Case Handling**: The program does not correctly handle the general case where `m` (the remaining number of positions to place rooks) is greater than 2. The DP transition logic does not accurately reflect the combinatorial nature of the problem.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated combinatorial approach or a different DP formulation is required. The current implementation fails to account for the constraints and requirements of the problem accurately.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2
1 2
2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- After the first move (1, 2), the computer places a black rook at (2, 1).
- After the second move (2, 3), the computer places a black rook at (3, 2).
- The remaining positions are (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), and (4, 4).
- The only valid configuration is placing a white rook at (1, 3) and a black rook at (3, 1), then placing a white rook at (4, 4) and a black rook at (4, 4).

The program would likely output a different number due to the incorrect DP transition logic. Thus, the program is incorrect.
