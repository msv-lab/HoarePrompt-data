Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ `r_i`, `c_i` ≤ `n`. It is guaranteed that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is now assigned the value of the integer input, which is between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as they have not been affected by the code snippet provided.
