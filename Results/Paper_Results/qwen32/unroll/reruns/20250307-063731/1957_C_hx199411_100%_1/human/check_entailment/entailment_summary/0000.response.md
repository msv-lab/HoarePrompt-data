### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to solve the problem of determining the number of different final configurations possible on an n x n chessboard after k moves, where you and the computer place white and black rooks respectively, with the computer mirroring your moves unless the move is on the diagonal.

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads `k` pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)` representing the positions of the rooks placed so far.

2. **Counting Non-Mirrored Moves:**
   - For each move `(r_i, c_i)`, if `r_i == c_i`, it means the move is on the diagonal, and it only counts as one move since the computer cannot mirror it.
   - If `r_i != c_i`, it counts as two moves because the computer mirrors the move.
   - The variable `num` keeps track of the total number of moves considered (including mirrored moves).

3. **Calculating Remaining Moves:**
   - The remaining number of moves `m` is calculated as `n - num`.
   - If `m` is 0 or 1, there's only one possible configuration, which is printed directly.

4. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - For `m > 1`, the program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of configurations.
   - A list `dp` is initialized where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place `i` pairs of rooks on an `i x i` board.
   - The base cases are `dp[1] = 1` (one way to place one pair) and `dp[2] = 3` (three ways to place two pairs).
   - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is used to fill the `dp` array up to `dp[m]`.
   - The final result is `dp[m]`, which is printed for each test case.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid configurations based on the given constraints and the problem description. It uses a dynamic programming approach to efficiently compute the number of configurations for larger values of `m`. The recurrence relation and base cases are correctly defined to handle the problem's requirements.

**Correctness: True**
