You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

Example

Input

    3
    
    4 1
    
    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6
    
    1000 4
    
    4 4
    
    952 343
    
    222 333
    
    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        num = 0
        for i in range(k):
            (c, r) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
            if c == r:
                num += 1
            else:
                num += 2
        m = n - num
        if m == 0:
            print(1)
        elif m == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            dp = [0 for i in range(m + 1)]
            dp[1] = 1
            dp[2] = 3
            for i in range(3, m + 1):
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
            print(dp[m])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and `k`, and `k` pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the pairs. The result is derived from a dynamic programming approach that considers the number of moves and their positions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of possible final configurations for every potential case. Specifically, the dynamic programming approach used in the code does not accurately model the problem's constraints and requirements.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Dynamic Programming Transition**: The transition in the dynamic programming (DP) array is incorrect. The current DP transition logic `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` does not correctly account for the placement of rooks on the chessboard. The problem involves placing rooks such that no two rooks attack each other, and the transitions need to consider the remaining available rows and columns for placing rooks.

2. **Base Cases**: The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` might be correct for specific small cases, but the general transition logic is flawed and does not scale correctly for larger values of `m`.

3. **Handling of Diagonal Moves**: The code handles diagonal moves (`c == r`) correctly by incrementing `num` by 1. However, for non-diagonal moves, it increments `num` by 2, which is not necessarily correct. Each non-diagonal move reduces the number of available positions for future moves by 2 (one for the white rook and one for the black rook), but the exact way to compute the number of configurations is more complex.

4. **General Case Handling**: The program does not correctly handle the general case where `m` (the remaining number of positions to place rooks) is greater than 2. The DP transition logic does not accurately reflect the combinatorial nature of the problem.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated combinatorial approach or a different DP formulation is required. The current implementation fails to account for the constraints and requirements of the problem accurately.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2
1 2
2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- After the first move (1, 2), the computer places a black rook at (2, 1).
- After the second move (2, 3), the computer places a black rook at (3, 2).
- The remaining positions are (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), and (4, 4).
- The only valid configuration is placing a white rook at (1, 3) and a black rook at (3, 1), then placing a white rook at (4, 4) and a black rook at (4, 4).

The program would likely output a different number due to the incorrect DP transition logic. Thus, the program is incorrect.
