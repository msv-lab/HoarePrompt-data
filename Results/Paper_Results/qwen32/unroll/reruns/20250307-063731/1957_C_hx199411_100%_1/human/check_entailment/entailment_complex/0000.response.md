### Reasoning:

The problem involves a chessboard where two players take turns placing rooks under specific constraints. The task is to determine the number of possible final configurations of the board after a certain number of moves, given that the first player's moves and the corresponding mirrored moves by the second player are already made.

The program provided follows these steps:

1. **Reading Input:** The program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves already played `k`. It then reads the `k` moves.

2. **Counting Moves:** The program counts how many of these moves are "special" (i.e., where the row and column are the same, `r == c`). Such moves do not have a mirrored counterpart. The program also counts the remaining moves, which have a mirrored counterpart.

3. **Calculating Remaining Positions:** The program calculates the number of positions `m` that are still available for placing rooks. This is done by subtracting the number of moves (both special and non-special) from the total number of positions `n`.

4. **Dynamic Programming:** If there are remaining positions (`m > 1`), the program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible configurations. The DP array `dp` is used to store the number of configurations for a given number of positions. The transition formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is used to compute the number of configurations for `i` positions.

5. **Output:** The program outputs the number of configurations for each test case.

The program correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements. It uses an efficient dynamic programming approach to compute the number of configurations, ensuring that the result is computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Correctness:

Given the provided explanation and the logic in the program, it appears that the program is correctly implementing the solution to the problem. The dynamic programming approach is appropriate for the problem, and the constraints are handled efficiently.

**Correctness: True**
