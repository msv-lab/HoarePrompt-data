You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

    4 1
    
    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6

    4 4
    
    952 343
    
    222 333
    
    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and `k`, and `k` pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the pairs. The result is derived from a dynamic programming approach that considers the number of moves and their positions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Game Setup**: 
   - We have an n x n chessboard.
   - Players place rooks on the board, with the player placing white rooks and the computer placing black rooks.
   - Rooks cannot attack each other, meaning no two rooks can be in the same row or column.
   - The computer mirrors the player's moves unless the move is on the diagonal (r = c), in which case the computer skips its turn.

2. **Initial Moves**: 
   - The player has already made k moves.
   - The computer has mirrored these moves where possible.

3. **Objective**: 
   - Determine the number of different final configurations possible after the initial k moves until no more valid moves can be made.
   - Output the result modulo 10^9+7.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution attempts to solve the problem by:
1. **Reading Input**: 
   - It reads the number of test cases (t).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard (n) and the number of moves already made (k).
   - It then reads the k moves made by the player.

2. **Counting Moves**:
   - It counts the number of moves on the diagonal (`num += 1`) and the number of moves not on the diagonal (`num += 2`).
   - This count helps in determining how many positions are still available for placing rooks.

3. **Calculating Remaining Positions**:
   - The number of remaining positions (`m`) is calculated as `n - num`.
   - If `m` is 0 or 1, there is only 1 possible configuration.

4. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - For `m > 1`, it uses a dynamic programming (DP) table to calculate the number of configurations.
   - The DP table is initialized with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The DP relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is used to fill the table.
   - This relation seems to account for the fact that for each new position, we can place a rook in two ways (either in the current row or column) and the remaining positions can be filled in `dp[i - 2]` ways.

### Correctness of the Solution

The provided solution seems to correctly implement the logic for counting the number of possible configurations based on the remaining positions on the board. The dynamic programming approach appears to be correctly formulated to account for the constraints and the problem requirements.

Given the problem constraints and the provided solution, the logic seems sound and the implementation appears to be correct.
