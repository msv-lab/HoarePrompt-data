Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the calculation of the number of possible final configurations. Specifically, the dynamic programming (DP) transition formula used in the code is incorrect for this problem.

The DP transition formula `(dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7))` is not correctly modeling the problem of placing rooks on the chessboard without attacking each other. The formula seems to be derived from a different problem setup or has a misunderstanding of the constraints and transitions in this specific rook placement problem.

Here are some key points to consider:
1. The DP transition formula should correctly account for the number of ways to place rooks such that no two rooks attack each other.
2. When `m` (the number of remaining positions to place rooks) is greater than 1, the number of ways to place rooks is not correctly handled by the current DP formula.

A correct approach would involve using combinatorial mathematics or a different DP approach that correctly models the problem. The current implementation is not correct for the given problem description.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the response is Correctness: **False**.
