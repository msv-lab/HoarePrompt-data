The provided code is implementing a Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal of a graph starting from a given vertex `ver`. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the execution process and the final output state:

1. **Initialization**: The BFS starts with a vertex `ver` which is added to the queue `q`. The vertex `ver` is marked as visited in the `vis` list.

2. **Processing the Queue**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in the queue `q`. In each iteration:
   - The vertex at the front of the queue is removed (`ver = q.popleft()`).
   - This vertex is printed.
   - The code then iterates over all adjacent vertices of `ver` (from `graph[ver]`).
   - For each adjacent vertex `node`, if it has not been visited (`if not vis[node]`), it is added to the queue (`q.append(node)`) and marked as visited (`vis[node] = 1`).

3. **Termination**: The loop terminates when the queue `q` is empty, meaning all reachable vertices from the initial vertex `ver` have been visited and processed.

**Output State**: **All reachable vertices from the initial vertex `ver` will have been visited and printed in BFS order. The queue `q` will be empty, and the `vis` list will have 1s for all visited vertices.**

In natural language, after the loop finishes executing, all vertices reachable from the starting vertex `ver` will have been printed in the order they were visited by the BFS algorithm. The queue `q` will be empty because all vertices have been processed. The `vis` list will reflect that all reachable vertices have been visited by marking their corresponding indices with 1.
