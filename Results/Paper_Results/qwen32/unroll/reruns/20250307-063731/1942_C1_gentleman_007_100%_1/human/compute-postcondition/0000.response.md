Output State: **ver is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, graph is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the graph, and vis is a list used to keep track of visited vertices where vis[ver] is 0 if the vertex has not been visited and 1 if it has; q is a deque object.**

In simple terms, the output state indicates that the variable `q` has been initialized as a deque object, while the other variables (`ver`, `graph`, and `vis`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
