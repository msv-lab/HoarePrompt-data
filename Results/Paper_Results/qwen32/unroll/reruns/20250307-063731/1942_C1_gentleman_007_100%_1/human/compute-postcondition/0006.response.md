Functionality: **The function `func_25` accepts three parameters: `ver`, an integer representing a vertex in the graph; `graph`, a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the graph; and `vis`, a list used to keep track of visited vertices where `vis[ver]` is 0 if the vertex has not been visited and 1 if it has. The function returns `True` if the vertex `ver` has already been visited (i.e., `vis[ver]` is 1); otherwise, it marks the vertex as visited by setting `vis[ver]` to 1 and returns `False`.**
