Output State: **The program returns the string formed by joining the elements of the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b`**

Explanation: The variable `s` is the string formed by joining the elements of `l`, where `l` is the reversed longest common subsequence of `a` and `b`. The code `return s[::-1]` reverses `s` back to the original longest common subsequence of `a` and `b`.
