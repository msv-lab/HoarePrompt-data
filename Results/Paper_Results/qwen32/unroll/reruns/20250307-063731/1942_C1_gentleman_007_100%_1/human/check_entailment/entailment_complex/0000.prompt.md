Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
[Proof Geometric Construction Can Solve All Love Affairs -
manbo-p](https://soundcloud.com/alice-law-314125270/manbo-p-proof-geometric-
construction-can-solve-all-love-affairs)

⠀

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

    #State: The provided loop is a typical Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm implementation. It starts from a given vertex (`ver`), explores all the vertices at the present depth level, and then moves on to vertices at the next depth level. The BFS algorithm ensures that each vertex is visited exactly once, and the order of visiting vertices is based on their distance from the starting vertex.
    #
    #Here's the step-by-step breakdown of what happens during the execution of the loop:
    #
    #1. **Initialization**: The `q` deque contains the starting vertex `ver`. The `vis` list indicates that `ver` is visited by setting `vis[ver]` to 1.
    #
    #2. **Processing**:
    #   - The loop continues as long as there are elements in the deque `q`.
    #   - In each iteration, the first element (`ver`) is popped from `q`.
    #   - This vertex is printed.
    #   - The algorithm then iterates over all the adjacent nodes of `ver` (i.e., `graph[ver]`).
    #   - For each adjacent node (`node`), if it has not been visited (`vis[node] == 0`), it is appended to `q` and marked as visited by setting `vis[node]` to 1.
    #
    #3. **Termination**: The loop terminates when `q` is empty, meaning all reachable vertices from the initial vertex `ver` have been visited.
    #
    #**Output State**: **All vertices reachable from the initial vertex `ver` are printed in BFS order, and the `vis` list has 1s for all visited vertices. The deque `q` is empty.**
    #
    #In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes, all vertices that can be reached starting from the initial vertex `ver` will have been printed in the order they were discovered by the BFS algorithm. The `vis` list will reflect that these vertices have been visited by marking the corresponding indices with 1. The deque `q` will be empty since all elements have been processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_25` performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from a given vertex `ver` in a graph represented by `graph`. It prints all vertices reachable from `ver` in BFS order and updates the `vis` list to mark these vertices as visited. The function does not return a value.
