The function `func_19` takes a sorted list of distinct integers `p` and an integer `x` such that `x` is greater than or equal to the first element of `p`. It returns the smallest index `mid` in `p` where `p[mid]` is greater than or equal to `x`. If `x` is greater than all elements in `p`, it returns the length of the list `p`.
