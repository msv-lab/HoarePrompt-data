The function accepts an integer `num` greater than 1 and a list `Prime_array` where each element `Prime_array[i]` is the smallest prime factor of `i` for all `i` from 2 to `num`. It returns a dictionary where the keys are the prime factors of `num` and the values are their respective counts in the prime factorization of `num`.
