Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not contain any implementation related to solving the problem described. The problem requires calculating the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed from a regular polygon with given vertices. However, the provided code includes several utility functions (like `gcd`, `prime factorization`, `binary search`, `dynamic programming` functions, etc.), none of which are used to solve the given problem.

The code does not define any function that takes the input parameters (`n`, `x`, and the list of vertices) and computes the desired output. Therefore, the code is not correct as it does not implement the required functionality.

To make the code correct, one needs to implement an algorithm that calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using the given vertices in a polygon. This typically involves sorting the vertices, checking for valid triangles, and ensuring no diagonals intersect.
