Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `vis` is a list used to keep track of visited vertices where `vis[ver]` is 1 if the vertex has been visited, `q` is a deque object with `ver` appended to it.**

In simple terms, the vertex `ver` has been marked as visited in the `vis` list, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
