You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: ver is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, graph is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the graph, and vis is a list used to keep track of visited vertices where vis[ver] is 0 if the vertex has not been visited and 1 if it has.
def func_25(ver):
    q = deque()
    q.append(ver)
    vis[ver] = 1
    while len(q):
        ver = q.popleft()
        
        print(ver, end=' ')
        
        for node in graph[ver]:
            if not vis[node]:
                q.append(node)
                vis[node] = 1
        
    #State: The provided loop is a typical Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm implementation. It starts from a given vertex (`ver`), explores all the vertices at the present depth level, and then moves on to vertices at the next depth level. The BFS algorithm ensures that each vertex is visited exactly once, and the order of visiting vertices is based on their distance from the starting vertex.
    #
    #Here's the step-by-step breakdown of what happens during the execution of the loop:
    #
    #1. **Initialization**: The `q` deque contains the starting vertex `ver`. The `vis` list indicates that `ver` is visited by setting `vis[ver]` to 1.
    #
    #2. **Processing**:
    #   - The loop continues as long as there are elements in the deque `q`.
    #   - In each iteration, the first element (`ver`) is popped from `q`.
    #   - This vertex is printed.
    #   - The algorithm then iterates over all the adjacent nodes of `ver` (i.e., `graph[ver]`).
    #   - For each adjacent node (`node`), if it has not been visited (`vis[node] == 0`), it is appended to `q` and marked as visited by setting `vis[node]` to 1.
    #
    #3. **Termination**: The loop terminates when `q` is empty, meaning all reachable vertices from the initial vertex `ver` have been visited.
    #
    #**Output State**: **All vertices reachable from the initial vertex `ver` are printed in BFS order, and the `vis` list has 1s for all visited vertices. The deque `q` is empty.**
    #
    #In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes, all vertices that can be reached starting from the initial vertex `ver` will have been printed in the order they were discovered by the BFS algorithm. The `vis` list will reflect that these vertices have been visited by marking the corresponding indices with 1. The deque `q` will be empty since all elements have been processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_25` accepts three parameters: `ver`, an integer representing a vertex in the graph; `graph`, a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the graph; and `vis`, a list used to keep track of visited vertices where `vis[ver]` is 0 if the vertex has not been visited and 1 if it has. The function returns `True` if the vertex `ver` has already been visited (i.e., `vis[ver]` is 1); otherwise, it marks the vertex as visited by setting `vis[ver]` to 1 and returns `False`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
