### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by drawing diagonals between chosen vertices of a regular polygon. The given program calculates this based on the vertices Bessie has already chosen and the additional vertices you can choose (which is zero in this version).

The logic of the program is as follows:
1. **Initialization and Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the number of sides of the polygon `n`, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen `x`, and the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose `y` (which is always 0 in this version).
2. **Sorting and Counting Triangles**: The program sorts the list of chosen vertices and then iterates through this list to count potential triangles. Specifically, it increments the count if two consecutive vertices are exactly two positions apart in the polygon (indicating a triangle can be formed with a diagonal). It also checks for special cases where the first and last vertices can form a triangle with the second and second-to-last vertices, respectively.
3. **Output**: For each test case, it outputs the calculated number of triangles.

The provided functions, however, are not directly used in the main logic of the program. They appear to be utility functions for various purposes (like reading input, calculating GCD, performing binary search, etc.), but they are not utilized in the given code snippet. The main logic is contained in the loop where the program reads test cases and calculates the number of triangles.

Given the problem constraints and the provided main logic, the program seems to correctly calculate the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be formed based on the vertices Bessie has chosen. The logic is sound for the given problem description and the test cases provided.
