You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

    #State: The provided loop is a typical Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm implementation. It starts from a given vertex (`ver`), explores all the vertices at the present depth level, and then moves on to vertices at the next depth level. The BFS algorithm ensures that each vertex is visited exactly once, and the order of visiting vertices is based on their distance from the starting vertex.
    #
    #Here's the step-by-step breakdown of what happens during the execution of the loop:
    #
    #1. **Initialization**: The `q` deque contains the starting vertex `ver`. The `vis` list indicates that `ver` is visited by setting `vis[ver]` to 1.
    #
    #2. **Processing**:
    #   - The loop continues as long as there are elements in the deque `q`.
    #   - In each iteration, the first element (`ver`) is popped from `q`.
    #   - This vertex is printed.
    #   - The algorithm then iterates over all the adjacent nodes of `ver` (i.e., `graph[ver]`).
    #   - For each adjacent node (`node`), if it has not been visited (`vis[node] == 0`), it is appended to `q` and marked as visited by setting `vis[node]` to 1.
    #
    #3. **Termination**: The loop terminates when `q` is empty, meaning all reachable vertices from the initial vertex `ver` have been visited.
    #
    #**Output State**: **All vertices reachable from the initial vertex `ver` are printed in BFS order, and the `vis` list has 1s for all visited vertices. The deque `q` is empty.**
    #
    #In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes, all vertices that can be reached starting from the initial vertex `ver` will have been printed in the order they were discovered by the BFS algorithm. The `vis` list will reflect that these vertices have been visited by marking the corresponding indices with 1. The deque `q` will be empty since all elements have been processed.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not contain any implementation related to solving the problem described. The problem requires calculating the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed from a regular polygon with given vertices. However, the provided code includes several utility functions (like `gcd`, `prime factorization`, `binary search`, `dynamic programming` functions, etc.), none of which are used to solve the given problem.

The code does not define any function that takes the input parameters (`n`, `x`, and the list of vertices) and computes the desired output. Therefore, the code is not correct as it does not implement the required functionality.

To make the code correct, one needs to implement an algorithm that calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using the given vertices in a polygon. This typically involves sorting the vertices, checking for valid triangles, and ensuring no diagonals intersect.
