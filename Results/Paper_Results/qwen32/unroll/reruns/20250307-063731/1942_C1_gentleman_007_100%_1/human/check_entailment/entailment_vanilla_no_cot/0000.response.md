Correctness: **False**

The provided program includes a large number of functions, but it does not contain any logic to solve the specific problem described. The problem requires calculating the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using a given set of vertices in a regular polygon. The program does not implement any algorithm to achieve this, and thus it is incorrect for the given problem.
