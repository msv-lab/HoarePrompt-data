Functionality: **The function `func_25` performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from a given vertex `ver` in a graph represented by `graph`. It prints all vertices reachable from `ver` in BFS order and updates the `vis` list to mark these vertices as visited. The function does not return a value.**
