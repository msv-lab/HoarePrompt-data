Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the graph, and `vis` is a list used to keep track of visited vertices where `vis[ver]` is 0 if the vertex has not been visited and 1 if it has; `q` is a deque object with `ver` appended to it.**

In simple terms, the vertex `ver` has been added to the end of the deque `q`. The values of `ver`, `graph`, `vis`, and the other elements in `q` remain unchanged except that `q` now includes `ver` at its end.
