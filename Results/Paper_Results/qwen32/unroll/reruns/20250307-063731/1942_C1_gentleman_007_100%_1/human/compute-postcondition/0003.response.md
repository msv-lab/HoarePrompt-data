To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `len(q)`. The loop will execute if and only if the deque `q` is not empty.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph.
- `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the graph.
- `vis` is a list used to keep track of visited vertices where `vis[ver]` is 1 if the vertex has been visited.
- `q` is a deque object with `ver` appended to it.

The condition `len(q)` checks if the deque `q` has any elements. Since `q` is described as having `ver` appended to it, it should not be empty. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to ensure that the loop can execute the first time.

State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the graph, `vis` is a list used to keep track of visited vertices where `vis[ver]` is 1 if the vertex has been visited, `q` is a deque object with `ver` appended to it**
