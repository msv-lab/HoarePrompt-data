The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` representing the number of sides of a polygon and `m` representing the number of vertices chosen. It returns a 2D list `l` of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` where `l[x][y]` and `l[y][x]` are set to `1` for each pair `(x, y)` obtained from `m` iterations of `func_1()`, and all other elements are `0`.
