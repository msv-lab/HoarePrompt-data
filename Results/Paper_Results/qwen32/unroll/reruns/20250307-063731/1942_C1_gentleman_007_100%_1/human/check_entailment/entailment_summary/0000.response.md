### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing vertices from a regular polygon. The key points are:
1. We have a regular polygon with `n` sides.
2. `x` vertices are already chosen.
3. We are not allowed to choose any additional vertices (`y = 0`).

The solution provided in the main code block calculates the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using the already chosen `x` vertices. The logic is as follows:
- The initial number of triangles is `x - 2`, which is the maximum number of triangles that can be formed by `x` points on a circle without any additional points.
- It then checks for consecutive vertices in the sorted list of chosen vertices. If two consecutive vertices are adjacent (i.e., their difference is 2), an additional triangle can be formed, so it increments the count.
- Finally, it checks if the first and last vertices in the sorted list are adjacent to the start and end of the polygon, respectively, to see if an additional triangle can be formed.

The provided code logic seems to correctly implement the above logic. The functions listed do not seem to be directly used in the main logic provided, and they appear to be unrelated to the problem at hand.

### Correctness:

Given the provided code logic and the problem description, the solution appears to be correct.
