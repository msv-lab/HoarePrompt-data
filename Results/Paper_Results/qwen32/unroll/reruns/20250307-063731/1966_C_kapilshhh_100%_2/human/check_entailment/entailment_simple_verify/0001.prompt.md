You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

Output

    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

        for i in range(1, n):
            dp = arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The game described is a variant of the Nim game where players take turns removing stones from piles. The key difference is that in each turn, a player must remove the same number of stones from each non-empty pile. The player who cannot make a move loses.

The optimal strategy in such games often involves the concept of Grundy numbers or Nim-sum, but in this specific problem, we can simplify our approach by analyzing the parity (odd or even) of the number of piles of each distinct size.

### Key Observations

1. **Distinct Pile Sizes**: The game's outcome is determined by the distinct pile sizes. If the number of piles of each distinct size is odd, Alice wins. If it's even, Bob wins.
2. **Sorting and Grouping**: By sorting the distinct pile sizes in descending order and checking the differences, we can determine the parity of the number of piles of each size.

### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to determine the winner by:
1. Reading the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, reading the number of piles and their respective sizes.
3. Sorting the distinct pile sizes in descending order.
4. Using a loop to check the differences between consecutive distinct sizes and toggling a boolean `dp` accordingly.
5. Printing "Alice" if `dp` is `True` and "Bob" if `dp` is `False`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The program's logic for determining the winner is incorrect. The `dp` variable is toggled based on the difference between consecutive distinct pile sizes, which does not correctly reflect the parity of the number of piles of each size.
2. **Handling Ties**: The program does not correctly handle cases where the number of piles of each size is even or odd. It incorrectly assumes that toggling `dp` based on the difference will determine the winner.

### Correct Approach

To correctly determine the winner, we should:
1. Count the number of piles of each distinct size.
2. Check the parity of these counts. If the number of piles of any size is odd, Alice wins. Otherwise, Bob wins.

### Conclusion

Given the issues in the provided program's logic for determining the winner, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
