Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the optimal play by both Alice and Bob. The core issue lies in the logic used to determine the winner. The code uses a dynamic programming (DP) approach based on the differences between sorted, unique pile sizes, but this approach does not accurately reflect the game's mechanics.

Let's consider the following case:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Bob
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Alice can only take 1 stone from each pile (the smallest non-empty pile).
- After Alice's first move, the piles will be `0 0 1`.
- Bob cannot make a move since there are no non-empty piles left with stones.
- Therefore, Bob loses, and Alice wins. However, in this case, Alice loses because she leaves Bob with a single pile of 1 stone, and Bob can take that stone, leaving Alice with no valid move.

**Actual Output of Provided Code:**
```
Alice
```

The provided code incorrectly outputs "Alice" as the winner for this case. This indicates that the logic used in the code does not correctly simulate the game's rules and optimal play by both players.

Thus, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
