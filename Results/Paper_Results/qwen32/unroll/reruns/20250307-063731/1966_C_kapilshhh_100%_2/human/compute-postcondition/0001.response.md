To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `tc > 0` is satisfied. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `tc` is an input integer. The only variable we can adjust is `tc`.

For the loop to execute, `tc` must be greater than 0. Since `tc` is an input integer, we need to ensure it meets this condition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `tc` must be greater than 0**
