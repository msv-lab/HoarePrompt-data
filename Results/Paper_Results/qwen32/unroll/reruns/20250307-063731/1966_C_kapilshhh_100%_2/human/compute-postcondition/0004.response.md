Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers. For each test case, it determines whether 'Alice' or 'Bob' wins based on the differences between the sorted unique integers in the list. The function outputs 'Alice' if any two consecutive integers in the sorted list have a difference greater than 1, otherwise it outputs 'Bob'.**
