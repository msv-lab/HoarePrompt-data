Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules provided. The program seems to use a dynamic programming approach or a similar strategy, but it incorrectly processes the piles and the winning condition.

The key to solving this problem is understanding the concept of Nim-sum (XOR-sum) from combinatorial game theory. The game described is a variant of Nim, and the winning strategy depends on the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones. If the number of piles with an odd number of stones is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

Here is a correct implementation of the solution:

```python
def func():
    tc = int(input())
    while tc > 0:
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        odd_count = sum(1 for x in arr if x % 2 != 0)
        print('Alice' if odd_count % 2 != 0 else 'Bob')
        tc -= 1

func()
```

This implementation correctly counts the number of piles with an odd number of stones and determines the winner based on the parity of this count.
