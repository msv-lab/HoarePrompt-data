Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The game described is a variant of the Nim game where players take turns removing stones from piles. The key difference is that in each turn, a player must remove the same number of stones from each non-empty pile. The player who cannot make a move loses.

The optimal strategy in such games often involves the concept of Grundy numbers or Nim-sum, but in this specific problem, we can simplify our approach by analyzing the parity (odd or even) of the number of piles of each distinct size.

### Key Observations

1. **Distinct Pile Sizes**: The game's outcome is determined by the distinct pile sizes. If the number of piles of each distinct size is odd, Alice wins. If it's even, Bob wins.
2. **Sorting and Grouping**: By sorting the distinct pile sizes in descending order and checking the differences, we can determine the parity of the number of piles of each size.

### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to determine the winner by:
1. Reading the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, reading the number of piles and their respective sizes.
3. Sorting the distinct pile sizes in descending order.
4. Using a loop to check the differences between consecutive distinct sizes and toggling a boolean `dp` accordingly.
5. Printing "Alice" if `dp` is `True` and "Bob" if `dp` is `False`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The program's logic for determining the winner is incorrect. The `dp` variable is toggled based on the difference between consecutive distinct pile sizes, which does not correctly reflect the parity of the number of piles of each size.
2. **Handling Ties**: The program does not correctly handle cases where the number of piles of each size is even or odd. It incorrectly assumes that toggling `dp` based on the difference will determine the winner.

### Correct Approach

To correctly determine the winner, we should:
1. Count the number of piles of each distinct size.
2. Check the parity of these counts. If the number of piles of any size is odd, Alice wins. Otherwise, Bob wins.

### Conclusion

Given the issues in the provided program's logic for determining the winner, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
