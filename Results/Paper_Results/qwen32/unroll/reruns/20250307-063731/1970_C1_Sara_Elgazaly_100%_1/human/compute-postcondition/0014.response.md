Let's break down the given information and the code snippet step by step:

Initial State:
- `one` is `True`
- `tmp` is `z` (Note: `tmp` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task)
- `two` is `True`

The code snippet is:
```python
print('Hermione' if two and one else 'Ron')
```

In this code, the `print` statement uses a conditional expression (also known as a ternary operator in some languages). The expression `two and one` is evaluated first:
- `two` is `True`
- `one` is `True`
- `two and one` evaluates to `True` because both `two` and `one` are `True`.

Since `two and one` evaluates to `True`, the expression `'Hermione' if two and one else 'Ron'` will resolve to `'Hermione'`.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output `'Hermione'`.

Output: **Hermione**
