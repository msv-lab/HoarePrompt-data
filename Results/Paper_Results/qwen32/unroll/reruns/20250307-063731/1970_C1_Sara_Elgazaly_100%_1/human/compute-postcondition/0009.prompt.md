Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t=1, the tree has exactly n nodes and n-1 edges, the tree has exactly two leaves, and the next line contains t integers (in this case, a single integer) 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, representing the starting node for the round; `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input; `lst` is a defaultdict of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree; `rev` is a defaultdict of lists representing the reverse adjacency list of the tree; `z` is an input integer; `tmp` is equal to `z`; `one` is True.
Code of the loop:
while lst[tmp] != []:
    one = not one
    tmp = lst[tmp].pop()



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
