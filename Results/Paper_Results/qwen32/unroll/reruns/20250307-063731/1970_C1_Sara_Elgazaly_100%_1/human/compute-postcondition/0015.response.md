Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of nodes in a tree (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5), and `t`, an integer which is always 1. The tree has exactly n nodes and n-1 edges, and it has exactly two leaves. Additionally, the function receives a single integer `u_1` (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the starting node for a round. The function returns a value based on these inputs, which is not specified in the provided constraints but is implied to be related to the structure or traversal of the tree starting from `u_1`.**
