The given code snippet initializes a new `defaultdict` of lists named `rev`. This does not affect the existing variables `n`, `t`, `u_1`, `x`, `y`, or `lst`. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `rev`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t=1, the tree has exactly n nodes and n-1 edges, the tree has exactly two leaves, and the next line contains t integers (in this case, a single integer) 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, representing the starting node for the round; `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input; `lst` is a defaultdict of lists; `rev` is a defaultdict of lists.**
