The code snippet `z = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `z`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, `x`, `y`, `lst`, or `rev`. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `z` with the value of the input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t=1, the tree has exactly n nodes and n-1 edges, the tree has exactly two leaves, and the next line contains t integers (in this case, a single integer) 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, representing the starting node for the round; `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input; `lst` is a defaultdict of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree; `rev` is a defaultdict of lists representing the reverse adjacency list of the tree; `z` is an input integer.**
