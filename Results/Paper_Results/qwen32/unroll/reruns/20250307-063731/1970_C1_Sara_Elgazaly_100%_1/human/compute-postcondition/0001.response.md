Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t=1, the tree has exactly n nodes and n-1 edges, the tree has exactly two leaves, and the next line contains t integers (in this case, a single integer) 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, representing the starting node for the round; `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input; `lst` is a defaultdict of lists.**

In this output state, the only change is the creation of the `lst` variable, which is a defaultdict of lists. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
