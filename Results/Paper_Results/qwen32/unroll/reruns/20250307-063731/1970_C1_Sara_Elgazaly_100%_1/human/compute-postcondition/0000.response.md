The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet. The initial state specifies certain conditions about the tree and the starting node, but these conditions do not change due to the execution of the given code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t=1, the tree has exactly n nodes and n-1 edges, the tree has exactly two leaves, and the next line contains t integers (in this case, a single integer) 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, representing the starting node for the round; `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input.**
