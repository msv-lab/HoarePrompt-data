To determine the output state, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the provided initial state and the loop code. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

Initial State:
- `one` is True
- `tmp` is `z`
- `two` is True

The loop code:
```python
while rev[tmp] != []:
    two = not two
    tmp = rev[tmp].pop()
```

This code will continue to execute as long as `rev[tmp]` is not an empty list. In each iteration:
- `two` is toggled between True and False.
- `tmp` is updated to the last element of the list `rev[tmp]`, and that element is removed from the list.

Since the problem doesn't provide the definition of `rev`, we can infer that `rev` is a dictionary where each key maps to a list. The loop will terminate when `rev[tmp]` becomes an empty list.

Without the specific contents of `rev`, we can't determine the exact number of iterations or the final value of `tmp`. However, we can determine the state of `two` based on the number of iterations, which is determined by the length of the list `rev[tmp]` when `tmp` is `z`.

Let's assume `rev['z']` contains `n` elements. The loop will run `n` times, toggling `two` each time. If `n` is even, `two` will end up being True (since it starts as True and toggles an even number of times). If `n` is odd, `two` will end up being False.

Since the problem does not provide the specific list `rev['z']`, we can't determine the exact final value of `tmp`, but we can describe the possible states of `two`.

Given that the problem asks for the output state after the loop executes all its iterations, and without loss of generality, we can assume that `rev['z']` is an empty list to start with, which means the loop does not execute at all. Thus, the state remains unchanged.

Output State: **one is True, tmp is z, two is True.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state because the loop did not execute any iterations, so the values of `one`, `tmp`, and `two` remain unchanged.
