### Reasoning

Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and the provided code to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Recap

1. **Objective**: Maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake using `x` vertices chosen from a regular polygon with `n` sides.
2. **Constraints**: 
   - `4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`
   - `2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)`
   - `y = 0` (no additional vertices can be chosen)
3. **Key Observations**:
   - To form a triangle, we need 3 distinct vertices.
   - The maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using `x` vertices is `x - 2`, provided that `x` is at least 3. This is because each new triangle after the first one shares one vertex with the previous triangle, requiring only 2 additional vertices.

#### Code Analysis

The provided code reads the input and processes each test case as follows:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case: `n`, `x`, `y` (where `y` is always `0`), and a list of `x` vertices.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The code calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles using the formula `x - 2` and prints this value.

#### Validation with Annotations

The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- Before the function call, `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n`, `x`, and `y` are read, and `arr` is a list of `x` vertices.
- The output for each test case is `x - 2`.

#### Evaluation Against Problem Requirements

- **Correct Formula**: The formula `x - 2` is correct for calculating the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed with `x` vertices.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - When `x = 3`, the formula `x - 2` correctly outputs `1`, which is the maximum number of triangles that can be formed.
  - When `x = 4`, the formula `x - 2` correctly outputs `2`, which is the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed.
  - When `x = 5`, the formula `x - 2` correctly outputs `3`, which is the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed.
  - This pattern holds true for any `x ≥ 3`.

#### Conclusion

Given the problem requirements and the provided code, the code correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the `x` vertices Bessie has chosen. The output `x - 2` is accurate for all valid inputs.
