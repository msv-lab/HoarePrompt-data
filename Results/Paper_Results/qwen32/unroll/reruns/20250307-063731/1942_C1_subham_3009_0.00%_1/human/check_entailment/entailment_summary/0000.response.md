### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the given program:

**Problem Understanding:**
- We are given a regular polygon with `n` sides.
- Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices.
- We need to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using these `x` vertices and no additional vertices (`y = 0`).

**Key Insight:**
- The problem is essentially asking how many triangles can be formed with `x` vertices of a polygon.
- In a polygon, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using `x` vertices is `x - 2`. This is because any set of `x` vertices can form a polygon, and triangulating a polygon with `x` vertices will always yield `x - 2` triangles.

**Program Analysis:**
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` (where `y` is always 0).
- It then reads a list of `x` vertices.
- Finally, it prints `x - 2` for each test case.

**Conclusion:**
- The program correctly computes the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be formed using the given `x` vertices, which is `x - 2`.
- This aligns with the problem's requirements and the key insight mentioned above.

### Correctness: **True**
