Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, which is the number of test cases (an integer between 1 and 10,000), and for each test case, it accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer between 4 and 1,000,000,000), `x` (an integer between 2 and the minimum of `n` or 200,000), and `y` (which is always 0). Additionally, for each test case, it accepts a list of `x` distinct integers ranging from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
