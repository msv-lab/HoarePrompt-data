### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing vertices from a regular polygon. Given the constraint that `y = 0`, no additional vertices can be chosen beyond the `x` vertices already picked by Bessie.

In the provided program, the output for each test case is simply `x - 2`. This output is derived from the observation that, with `x` vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `x - 2`. This is a well-known result in combinatorial geometry, where `x` points on a convex hull can form at most `x - 2` triangles by connecting them with non-intersecting diagonals.

Here is a brief explanation of why `x - 2` is the correct output:

- When `x` vertices are chosen, they form a convex polygon.
- The maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed from `x` vertices of a convex polygon is `x - 2`. This can be achieved by triangulating the polygon using non-intersecting diagonals.

Given the problem constraints and the provided program, the output `x - 2` is indeed the correct maximum number of triangular pieces that can be formed for each test case.
