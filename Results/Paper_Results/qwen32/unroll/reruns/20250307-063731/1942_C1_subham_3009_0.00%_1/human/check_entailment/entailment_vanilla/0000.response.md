To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem and the code step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves a regular polygon with `n` sides. Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices from these `n` vertices, and she wants to form non-intersecting triangles using these vertices and potentially up to `y` additional vertices. However, in this version of the problem, `y` is always `0`, meaning no additional vertices can be chosen.

The task is to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using only the `x` vertices Bessie has chosen.

### Key Observations

1. **Vertices and Triangles**: To form a triangle, we need 3 vertices. If Bessie has chosen `x` vertices, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed without any additional vertices is determined by how these `x` vertices can be grouped into sets of 3.

2. **Non-Intersecting Diagonals**: The problem specifies that the diagonals must be non-intersecting. This means that the triangles must be formed in such a way that no two diagonals cross each other inside the polygon.

3. **Maximum Triangles**: The maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using `x` vertices is `x - 2`, provided that `x` is at least 3. This is because each triangle uses 3 vertices, and adding a new triangle requires 2 additional vertices (since one vertex is shared with the previous triangle).

### Code Analysis

Let's look at the provided code:

```python
def func():
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
            arr = input().split()
            arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
            print(x - 2)
```

- The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` (though `y` is always `0` in this version).
- It reads the `x` vertices that Bessie has chosen.
- It then prints `x - 2`, which is the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using `x` vertices.

### Conclusion

The code correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the `x` vertices Bessie has chosen. The output `x - 2` is correct based on the problem's requirements.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
