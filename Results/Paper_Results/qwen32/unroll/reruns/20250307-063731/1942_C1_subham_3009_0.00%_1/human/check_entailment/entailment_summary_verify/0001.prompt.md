You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

- Program:
def func():
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
            arr = input().split()
            arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
            print(x - 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (where `y` is always 0), and a list of `x` distinct integers representing vertices. It then outputs `x - 2` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem and the code step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves a regular polygon with `n` sides. Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices from these `n` vertices, and she wants to form non-intersecting triangles using these vertices and potentially up to `y` additional vertices. However, in this version of the problem, `y` is always `0`, meaning no additional vertices can be chosen.

The task is to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using only the `x` vertices Bessie has chosen.

### Key Observations

1. **Vertices and Triangles**: To form a triangle, we need 3 vertices. If Bessie has chosen `x` vertices, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed without any additional vertices is determined by how these `x` vertices can be grouped into sets of 3.

2. **Non-Intersecting Diagonals**: The problem specifies that the diagonals must be non-intersecting. This means that the triangles must be formed in such a way that no two diagonals cross each other inside the polygon.

3. **Maximum Triangles**: The maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using `x` vertices is `x - 2`, provided that `x` is at least 3. This is because each triangle uses 3 vertices, and adding a new triangle requires 2 additional vertices (since one vertex is shared with the previous triangle).

### Code Analysis

Let's look at the provided code:

```python
def func():
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
            arr = input().split()
            arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
            print(x - 2)
```

- The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` (though `y` is always `0` in this version).
- It reads the `x` vertices that Bessie has chosen.
- It then prints `x - 2`, which is the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using `x` vertices.

### Conclusion

The code correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the `x` vertices Bessie has chosen. The output `x - 2` is correct based on the problem's requirements.
