t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (4 <= n <= 10^9), an integer x (2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5)), an integer y (y = 0), and a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
