The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. After executing the code, the value of `t` will be the integer input provided, and it will replace the previous description of `t` as an integer within the specified range.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input provided, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is 0. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The program is running as the main module, indicated by `__name__ == '__main__'`.**
