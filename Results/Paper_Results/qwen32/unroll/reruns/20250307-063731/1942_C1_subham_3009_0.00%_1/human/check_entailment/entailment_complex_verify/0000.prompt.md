You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

        #State: The output state consists of `t` lines, each containing `x - 2` for the corresponding test case.
    #State: For each test case, if the program is run as the main module, the output consists of `t` lines, each containing `x - 2` for the corresponding test case. If the program is not run as the main module, there is no output.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (where `y` is always 0), and a list of `x` distinct integers representing vertices. It then outputs `x - 2` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the program is simply subtracting 2 from the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (`x - 2`) and printing that result for each test case. This approach does not take into account the actual geometric constraints and the optimal way to form non-intersecting triangles within the polygon.

Let's analyze why this is incorrect with an example:

#### Example:
Consider the test case:
```
8 4 0
1 6 2 5
```
The program will output `2` because `x = 4` and `4 - 2 = 2`. However, let's examine if this is the correct answer.

For a regular polygon with vertices `1, 6, 2, 5`, we can form the following non-intersecting triangles:
- Triangle formed by vertices `1, 2, 5`
- Triangle formed by vertices `1, 5, 6`
- Triangle formed by vertices `2, 5, 6`

Thus, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `3`, not `2`.

#### Another Example:
Consider the test case:
```
8 8 0
1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
```
The program will output `6` because `x = 8` and `8 - 2 = 6`. However, in this case, since all vertices are chosen, we can form a complete triangulation of the polygon, which results in `6` non-intersecting triangles. This is correct for this specific case, but it doesn't mean the program is correct in general. The program needs to handle all cases correctly.

#### Conclusion:
The program's logic is oversimplified and does not correctly compute the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake for all possible configurations of vertices. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
