You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and y is 0. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
def func():
    if (__name__ == '__main__') :
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            
            [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
            
            arr = input().split()
            
            arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
            
            print(x - 2)
            
        #State: The output state consists of `t` lines, each containing `x - 2` for the corresponding test case.
    #State: For each test case, if the program is run as the main module, the output consists of `t` lines, each containing `x - 2` for the corresponding test case. If the program is not run as the main module, there is no output.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `t`, which is the number of test cases (an integer between 1 and 10,000), and for each test case, it accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer between 4 and 1,000,000,000), `x` (an integer between 2 and the minimum of `n` or 200,000), and `y` (which is always 0). Additionally, for each test case, it accepts a list of `x` distinct integers ranging from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
