To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the loop condition `l <= r`. The variables `l` and `r` are the only ones that can be adjusted according to the problem statement.

Given:
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 1`.

For the loop to execute, the condition `l <= r` must be true. Let's analyze the condition:
- If `n` is at least 1, then `r` will be `0` (since `r = n - 1`), and `l` is `0`. Therefore, `l <= r` will be `0 <= 0`, which is true.
- If `n` is 0, then `r` will be `-1` (since `r = n - 1`), and `l` is `0`. Therefore, `l <= r` will be `0 <= -1`, which is false, and the loop will not execute.

Since `n` is given to be an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`, `n` will always be at least 1. Therefore, the condition `l <= r` will always be true, and no adjustment is needed for `l` and `r` to satisfy the loop condition.

Thus, the state does not need to be modified, and the loop can certainly execute one time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 1`. `sunks` is 0.**
