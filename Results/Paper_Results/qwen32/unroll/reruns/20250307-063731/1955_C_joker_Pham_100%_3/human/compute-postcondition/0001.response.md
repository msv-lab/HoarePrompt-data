Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. It is also given that the sum of `n` for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 1`. `sunks` is 0.**

Natural language: The variable `sunks` has been initialized to 0. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, and `r`) retain their initial values.
