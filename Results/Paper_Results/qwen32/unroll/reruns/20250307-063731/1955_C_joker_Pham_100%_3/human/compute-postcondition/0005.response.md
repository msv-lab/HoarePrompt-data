Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of elements in the list `a`; `k`, an integer representing a threshold value; and `a`, a list of `n` integers. The function returns the number of elements in the list `a` that are "sunk," which is determined based on the value of `k`.**
