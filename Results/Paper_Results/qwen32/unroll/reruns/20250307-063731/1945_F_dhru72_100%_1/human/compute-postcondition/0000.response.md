The provided code snippet only contains a type variable declaration `T = TypeVar('T')`. This line does not affect any of the existing variables in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `v`, and `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000. v is a list of integers of size n where 1 <= v_i <= 10^9. p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
