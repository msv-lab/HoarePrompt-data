You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        A.sort()
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        t = t - 1



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. It then calculates and prints the sum of the smallest elements in each pair of the sorted list for that test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` equal to 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:
To solve this problem, we need to maximize the score by performing the described operations optimally. The key insight is that to maximize the sum of the minimums of pairs, we should pair the smallest numbers together. This is because the smallest number in each pair will contribute to the score, and by pairing the smallest numbers, we ensure that the contributions to the score are maximized.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` (which indicates that there are `2n` numbers on the whiteboard).
   - It then reads the `2n` integers representing the numbers on the whiteboard.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the list of numbers in ascending order. This is crucial because we want to pair the smallest numbers together to maximize the sum of the minimums.

3. **Calculating the Score**:
   - After sorting, the program calculates the score by summing every second element starting from the first element (i.e., `A[0]`, `A[2]`, `A[4]`, ..., `A[2n-2]`). This is because, in the sorted list, these elements are the smaller ones in their respective pairs.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated score for each test case.

### Verification:
- The approach ensures that we are always adding the smallest possible number from each pair to the score, which is optimal.
- The time complexity of the solution is dominated by the sorting step, which is \(O(2n \log(2n)) = O(n \log n)\), which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the optimal strategy to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:
