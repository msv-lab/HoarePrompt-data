To determine the output state after the loop completes all its iterations, let's analyze the loop step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 5000).
- For each test case, `n` is the number of pairs (1 <= n <= 50).
- `A` is a list of 2n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^7).

### Loop Execution:
1. The loop runs `t` times.
2. For each iteration:
   - `n` is read as the number of pairs.
   - The list `A` of 2n integers is read and sorted.
   - The sum of the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) in the sorted list `A` is printed.
   - `t` is decremented by 1.

### Output Calculation:
- For each test case, the sorted list `A` is divided into pairs.
- The smallest elements in each pair are at the even indices of the sorted list.
- The sum of these smallest elements is printed.

### Final Output State:
- After all `t` iterations, the loop terminates.
- The variable `t` will be 0.
- The lists `A` and the variable `n` will be in their state from the last iteration, but they are not relevant to the output state as they are re-initialized in each iteration.
- The output of the program will be the printed sums for each test case.

### Output State:
Output State: **The program will print the sum of the smallest elements in each pair for each test case, and `t` will be 0.**

In simpler terms, the program will output the sum of the smallest elements in each pair for all test cases, and `t` will be reduced to 0 after all test cases are processed.
