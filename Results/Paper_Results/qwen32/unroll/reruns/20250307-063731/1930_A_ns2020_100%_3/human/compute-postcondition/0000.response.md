The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The values of `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` for each test case are not affected by this single line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and a list of 2n integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^7.**
