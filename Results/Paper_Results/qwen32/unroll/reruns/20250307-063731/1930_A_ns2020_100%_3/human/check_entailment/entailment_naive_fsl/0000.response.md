Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The given program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the score by always choosing the smallest available numbers in pairs. Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program works as intended:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The program sorts the array of integers. This ensures that the smallest numbers are at the beginning of the list.
2. **Selecting Pairs**: It then iterates through the sorted list, selecting every second element starting from the first (i.e., `A[::2]`). This ensures that the smallest numbers are chosen first, which maximizes the score because the score is incremented by the minimum of the two chosen numbers.
3. **Summing the Minimums**: By summing every second element of the sorted list, the program effectively adds the smallest possible values in each pair to the score.

The provided examples in the problem description are correctly handled by the program:
- For the first test case (`n=1`, `A=[2, 3]`), the program sorts the list to `[2, 3]` and selects `2` as the minimum, resulting in a score of `2`.
- For the second test case (`n=2`, `A=[1, 1, 2, 1]`), the program sorts the list to `[1, 1, 1, 2]` and selects `1` and `1` as the minimums in two moves, resulting in a score of `2`.
- For the third test case (`n=3`, `A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`), the program sorts the list to `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` and selects `1` in each of the three moves, resulting in a score of `3`.

Since the program correctly handles the provided examples and the logic of always choosing the smallest numbers in pairs is sound, it is correct for all potential cases within the given constraints.
