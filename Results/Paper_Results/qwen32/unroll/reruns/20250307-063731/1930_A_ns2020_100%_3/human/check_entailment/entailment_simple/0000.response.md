### Reasoning:
The problem requires us to maximize the score by performing a series of moves where each move involves selecting two integers from a list, adding the smaller of the two to the score, and removing both integers from the list. This process is repeated `n` times, where `2n` is the total number of integers.

The optimal strategy to maximize the score is to always pick the smallest available pair of integers in each move. This is because, by doing so, we ensure that we are adding the smallest possible value to the score in each step, thereby maximizing the total score.

The provided program correctly implements this strategy:
1. It first reads the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
3. The list of integers is sorted in ascending order.
4. The score is calculated by summing every second element from the sorted list (i.e., `A[::2]`), which corresponds to the smallest elements in each pair.
5. The program prints the score for each test case.

Since the program consistently follows the optimal strategy and correctly processes each test case as described, it is correct.
