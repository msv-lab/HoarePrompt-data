### Reasoning:
The provided program aims to solve the problem by sorting the list of integers and then summing every second element starting from the first element. Let's verify this approach step-by-step using the annotated code and the problem description.

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and then reads `2n` integers representing the numbers on the whiteboard.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the list of numbers in ascending order. This is a critical step because sorting ensures that the smallest numbers are paired together.

3. **Calculating the Score**:
   - After sorting, the program sums every second element starting from the first element (i.e., `A[0]`, `A[2]`, `A[4]`, ..., `A[2n-2]`). This approach is correct because, in the sorted list, these elements are indeed the smaller ones in their respective pairs.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated score for each test case.

### Verification:
- **Optimal Strategy**: The strategy of sorting and summing every second element from the start is optimal. By sorting, we ensure that the smallest numbers are paired together, which maximizes the sum of the minimums of these pairs.
- **Time Complexity**: The sorting step is \(O(2n \log(2n)) = O(n \log n)\), which is efficient given the constraints \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).

### Annotations:
- **State of the program right before the function call**: The program correctly reads the input values and processes each test case independently.
- **State after sorting**: The list `A` is sorted in ascending order.
- **State after calculating the score**: The program correctly sums the elements at even indices, which are the smaller elements in each pair.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the optimal strategy to solve the problem. The annotations confirm that the program behaves as expected at each step, and the reasoning provided in the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
