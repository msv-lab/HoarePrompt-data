### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to maximize the score by choosing pairs of numbers from the list and adding the smaller number of each pair to the score. The optimal strategy to achieve this is to sort the list of numbers and then sum every second element starting from the first element. This ensures that we are always picking the smaller number in each pair because the list is sorted in ascending order.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It reads the integer `n`, which indicates that there are `2n` integers in the list.
   - It reads the list of `2n` integers.
   - It sorts the list in ascending order.
   - It calculates the score by summing every second element in the sorted list (i.e., `A[0]`, `A[2]`, `A[4]`, ..., `A[2n-2]`).
   - It prints the calculated score for the current test case.
3. **Loop Until All Test Cases Are Processed**: The loop continues until all test cases have been processed (`t` becomes 0).

The provided program correctly implements this logic. By sorting the list and summing every second element, it ensures that we are always adding the smaller number of each pair to the score, thus maximizing the score.

### Correctness:

Based on the reasoning above, the program correctly implements the strategy to achieve the maximum score for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
