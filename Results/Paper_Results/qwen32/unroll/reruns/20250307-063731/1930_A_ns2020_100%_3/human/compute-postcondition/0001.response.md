The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. This means `t` is already within a range that ensures the loop will execute at least once since the minimum value of `t` is 1.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and a list of 2n integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^7.**
