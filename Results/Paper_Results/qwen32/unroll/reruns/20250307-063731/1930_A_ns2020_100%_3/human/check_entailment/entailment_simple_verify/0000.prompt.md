You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        A.sort()
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        t = t - 1



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^7.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        A.sort()
        
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        
        t = t - 1
        
    #State: The program will print the sum of the smallest elements in each pair for each test case, and `t` will be 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The given program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the score by always choosing the smallest available numbers in pairs. Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program works as intended:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The program sorts the array of integers. This ensures that the smallest numbers are at the beginning of the list.
2. **Selecting Pairs**: It then iterates through the sorted list, selecting every second element starting from the first (i.e., `A[::2]`). This ensures that the smallest numbers are chosen first, which maximizes the score because the score is incremented by the minimum of the two chosen numbers.
3. **Summing the Minimums**: By summing every second element of the sorted list, the program effectively adds the smallest possible values in each pair to the score.

The provided examples in the problem description are correctly handled by the program:
- For the first test case (`n=1`, `A=[2, 3]`), the program sorts the list to `[2, 3]` and selects `2` as the minimum, resulting in a score of `2`.
- For the second test case (`n=2`, `A=[1, 1, 2, 1]`), the program sorts the list to `[1, 1, 1, 2]` and selects `1` and `1` as the minimums in two moves, resulting in a score of `2`.
- For the third test case (`n=3`, `A=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`), the program sorts the list to `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` and selects `1` in each of the three moves, resulting in a score of `3`.

Since the program correctly handles the provided examples and the logic of always choosing the smallest numbers in pairs is sound, it is correct for all potential cases within the given constraints.
