Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. It then calculates and prints the sum of the smallest elements in each pair of the sorted list for that test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` equal to 0.**
