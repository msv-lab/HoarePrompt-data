Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the final score by always pairing the smallest available numbers. By sorting the list of integers and summing every second element starting from the first (which are the smallest due to sorting), the program ensures that the sum of the minimums of each pair is maximized. This aligns with the optimal strategy described in the problem statement.
