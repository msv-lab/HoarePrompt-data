### Reasoning:
The provided program indeed correctly implements the optimal strategy to solve the problem. Let's systematically evaluate the program using the annotations:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   - This is correctly handled by the lines:
     ```python
     t = int(input())
     while t:
         n = int(input())
         A = list(map(int, input().split()))
     ```

2. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the list of numbers in ascending order.
   - This is done by the line:
     ```python
     A.sort()
     ```
   - Sorting ensures that the smallest numbers are paired together, which is optimal for maximizing the sum of the minimums of each pair.

3. **Calculating the Score**:
   - The program calculates the score by summing every second element starting from the first element in the sorted list.
   - This is achieved by the line:
     ```python
     print(sum(A[::2]))
     ```
   - By summing the elements at even indices (`A[0]`, `A[2]`, `A[4]`, ..., `A[2n-2]`), the program correctly adds the smallest number from each pair to the score.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated score for each test case.
   - This is handled by the `print` statement inside the loop.

### Verification:
- The approach ensures that we are always adding the smallest possible number from each pair to the score, which is optimal.
- The time complexity of the solution is \(O(2n \log(2n)) = O(n \log n)\), which is efficient given the constraints (with \(n \leq 50\)).

### Annotations:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points and confirm that the program sorts the list and sums the appropriate elements.
- The final state of the program after processing all test cases is correctly described as `t` being 0.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the optimal strategy to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
