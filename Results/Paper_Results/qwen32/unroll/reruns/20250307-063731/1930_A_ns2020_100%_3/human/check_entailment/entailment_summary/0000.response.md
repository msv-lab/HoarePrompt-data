### Reasoning:

To solve the problem optimally, we need to maximize the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers chosen from the list. The strategy to achieve this is to sort the list of integers in ascending order and then sum up every second element starting from the first element. This works because, in a sorted list, the smallest element in each pair will be the earlier one in the sorted sequence.

Let's break down the program:
1. The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   - It sorts the list of integers.
   - It calculates the sum of every second element starting from the first element (i.e., `A[0] + A[2] + A[4] + ...`).
   - It prints the calculated sum.
3. The process repeats for all test cases until `t` becomes zero.

The execution summary aligns with this strategy and confirms that the program correctly implements it. Therefore, the program should yield the correct output for the given problem based on the provided logic.
