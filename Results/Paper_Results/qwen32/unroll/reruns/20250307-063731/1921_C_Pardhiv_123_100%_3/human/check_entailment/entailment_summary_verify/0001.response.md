Let's carefully analyze the program and the function summary to verify its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires determining whether Stepan can send all messages at specified moments without the phone's battery dropping to zero or below. The phone consumes `a` units of charge per unit of time while it is on and `b` units of charge when turned off and then on again.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the input for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of messages `n`, the initial charge `f`, the charge consumption per unit of time `a`, and the charge consumption for turning the phone off and on `b`. It also reads the list of moments `m_i` when the messages need to be sent.

The program then iterates through each message moment and calculates the charge consumption:
- For each message, it calculates the charge consumed if the phone is kept on from the previous message time to the current message time using `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])`.
- It also considers the charge consumed if the phone is turned off and then on again, which is `b`.

The minimum of these two values is subtracted from the current charge `f`. After processing all messages, if the charge `f` is still greater than zero, the program outputs "YES". Otherwise, it outputs "NO".

### Reasoning:
The core logic of the program seems correct. It considers both options (keeping the phone on or turning it off and on) for each message and subtracts the minimum charge consumption from the current charge. This ensures that Stepan uses the least amount of charge possible to send each message.

However, there is a critical issue with the logic:
- The program assumes that the phone can be turned off and on at any moment, including just before sending a message. This is correct.
- The program correctly calculates the charge consumption for both scenarios and subtracts the minimum.
- The issue arises when the phone's charge drops to zero or below at any point during the process. The program does not handle this scenario correctly.

The problem statement specifies that if the charge level drops to 0 (becomes ≤ 0), it is impossible to send a message at that moment. The program does not check if the charge becomes ≤ 0 at any point during the process. It only checks if the charge is > 0 after processing all messages.

### Correct Implementation:
To ensure the correctness, we need to check if the charge becomes ≤ 0 at any point during the process. Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    while t > 0:
        (n, f, a, b) = map(int, input('').split(' '))
        ls = [0] + list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            charge_to_keep_on = a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])
            f = f - min(charge_to_keep_on, b)
            if f <= 0:
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')
        t -= 1
```

### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly handle the scenario where the charge drops to zero or below at any point during the process. Therefore, the original assessment is incorrect.

Final: **False**
