Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `1 <= t <= 10^4`. For each test case, `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `1 <= f, a, b <= 10^9`. `m` is a list of `n` integers such that `1 <= m_i <= 10^9` and `m_i < m_{i + 1}`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.**

Explanation: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of the input, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4. All other variables (`n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `m`) remain unchanged as they have not been modified by the code snippet provided.
