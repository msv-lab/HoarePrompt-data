Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the phone needs to be turned off and on to conserve battery. Specifically, the program only considers the cost of turning off and on the phone once for each message, but it does not account for the possibility of turning the phone off and on multiple times between messages to conserve battery.

Let's consider a test case where the phone needs to be turned off and on multiple times:

**Test Case:**

```
1
3 10 1 2
2 4 6
```

**Explanation:**

- Initially, the phone has 10 units of charge.
- The phone loses 1 unit of charge per unit of time.
- The phone loses 2 units of charge when turned off and on.

To send the first message at moment 2:
- The phone loses 2 units of charge (turning off and on) and then 1 unit of charge (from moment 0 to 2).
- Remaining charge: 10 - 2 - 1 = 7 units.

To send the second message at moment 4:
- The phone loses 2 units of charge (turning off and on) and then 2 units of charge (from moment 2 to 4).
- Remaining charge: 7 - 2 - 2 = 3 units.

To send the third message at moment 6:
- The phone loses 2 units of charge (turning off and on) and then 2 units of charge (from moment 4 to 6).
- Remaining charge: 3 - 2 - 2 = -1 units.

In this scenario, the phone's charge drops to -1 units, which means it is not possible to send the third message. However, the program would output "YES" because it only considers the cost of turning off and on the phone once for each message, not accounting for the possibility of multiple turn-offs and turn-ons between messages.

The correct approach would be to consider the optimal strategy for turning the phone off and on to conserve battery, which may involve turning the phone off and on multiple times between messages. The provided program does not implement this logic, hence it is incorrect.
