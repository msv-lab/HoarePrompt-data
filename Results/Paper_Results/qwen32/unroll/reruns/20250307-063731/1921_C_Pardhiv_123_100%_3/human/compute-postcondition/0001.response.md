The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`. This means `t` is already guaranteed to be greater than 0, so no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an input integer, `1 <= t <= 10^4`**
