Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine if Stepan can send all the messages at specified moments without the phone's battery dropping to zero or below. The phone consumes charge `a` units per unit of time while it is on and `b` units when turned off and then on again. We need to decide whether Stepan should keep the phone on or turn it off and on again at each step to send the messages.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the input for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of messages `n`, the initial charge `f`, the charge consumption per unit of time `a`, and the charge consumption for turning the phone off and on `b`. It also reads the list of moments `m_i` when the messages need to be sent.

The program then iterates through each message moment and calculates the charge consumption. For each message, it checks whether it is more efficient to keep the phone on or to turn it off and on again:
- `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` calculates the charge consumed if the phone is kept on from the previous message time to the current message time.
- `b` is the charge consumed if the phone is turned off and then on again.

The minimum of these two values is subtracted from the current charge `f`. After processing all messages, if the charge `f` is still greater than zero, the program outputs "YES". Otherwise, it outputs "NO".

### Reasoning:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Stepan can send all the messages without the phone's battery dropping to zero or below. It considers the charge consumption for both keeping the phone on and turning it off and on again for each message. The decision to subtract the minimum charge consumption from the current charge ensures that the phone's charge is accurately tracked throughout the process.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem requirements and constraints. Therefore, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
