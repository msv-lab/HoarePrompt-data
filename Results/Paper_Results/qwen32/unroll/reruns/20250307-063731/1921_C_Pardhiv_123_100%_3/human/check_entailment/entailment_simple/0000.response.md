### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine if Stepan can send all the messages without running out of battery charge, given the constraints. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the logic:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of messages `n`, the initial charge `f`, the charge consumption per unit of time `a`, and the charge consumption when the phone is turned off and on `b`.

2. **Reading Message Times:**
   - It reads the list of message times `m` and prepends a `0` to it to handle the initial state (time 0).

3. **Processing Each Message:**
   - For each message time `m_i`, it calculates the time difference `ls[i] - ls[i - 1]` between the current message time and the previous one.
   - It then calculates the charge consumption in two scenarios:
     - If the phone remains on, the charge consumption is `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])`.
     - If the phone is turned off and on, the charge consumption is `b`.
   - The program chooses the minimum of these two values to update the remaining charge `f`.

4. **Final Check:**
   - After processing all messages, it checks if the remaining charge `f` is greater than 0.
   - If `f` is greater than 0, it prints "YES", indicating that Stepan can send all messages.
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness:

The logic in the program is correct. For each message, it correctly calculates the optimal charge consumption strategy (either keeping the phone on or turning it off and on) to minimize the charge usage. The program ensures that the phone does not run out of charge before sending each message. 

The handling of edge cases, such as the initial charge being very low or the charge consumption being very high, is also correctly managed by the program.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
