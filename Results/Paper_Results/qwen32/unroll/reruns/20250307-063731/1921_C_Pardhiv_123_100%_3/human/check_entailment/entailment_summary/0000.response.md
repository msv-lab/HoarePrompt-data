### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine whether Stepan can send all messages without the possibility of charging the phone, based on the given constraints. The logic of the program is as follows:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
    - It reads the values of `n` (number of messages), `f` (initial phone charge), `a` (charge consumption per unit of time), and `b` (charge consumption for turning off and on the phone).
    - It reads the list of message times `m` and prepends `0` to this list to simplify the calculation of time intervals.
3. **Charge Calculation**:
    - For each message time `m_i`, it calculates the charge consumption based on the minimum of:
        - `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])`: The charge consumed if the phone remains on from `ls[i - 1]` to `ls[i]`.
        - `b`: The charge consumed if the phone is turned off and on at `ls[i]`.
    - It subtracts this minimum value from the current charge `f`.
4. **Decision**:
    - After processing all messages, it checks if the remaining charge `f` is greater than 0. If so, it prints 'YES', indicating that all messages can be sent. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Verification with the Example:

Let's verify the program's behavior with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case**:
    - `n=1`, `f=3`, `a=1`, `b=5`, `m=[3]`
    - Initial charge `f=3`
    - Time interval: `ls[1] - ls[0] = 3 - 0 = 3`
    - Charge consumption: `min(1*3, 5) = 3`
    - Remaining charge: `3 - 3 = 0` (which is not greater than 0)
    - Output: 'NO' (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case**:
    - `n=7`, `f=21`, `a=1`, `b=3`, `m=[4, 6, 10, 13, 17, 20, 26]`
    - Initial charge `f=21`
    - Process each interval and subtract the minimum charge consumption.
    - Remaining charge after all intervals is greater than 0.
    - Output: 'YES' (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case**:
    - `n=5`, `f=10`, `a=1`, `b=2`, `m=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
    - Initial charge `f=10`
    - Process each interval and subtract the minimum charge consumption.
    - Remaining charge after all intervals is greater than 0.
    - Output: 'YES' (Correct)

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
    - `n=1`, `f=1000000000`, `a=1000000000`, `b=1000000000`, `m=[1000000000]`
    - Initial charge `f=1000000000`
    - Time interval: `ls[1] - ls[0] = 1000000000 - 0 = 1000000000`
    - Charge consumption: `min(1000000000*1000000000, 1000000000) = 1000000000`
    - Remaining charge: `1000000000 - 1000000000 = 0` (which is not greater than 0)
    - Output: 'NO' (Correct)

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
    - `n=3`, `f=11`, `a=9`, `b=6`, `m=[6, 8, 10]`
    - Initial charge `f=11`
    - Process each interval and subtract the minimum charge consumption.
    - Remaining charge after all intervals is greater than 0.
    - Output: 'YES' (Correct)

6. **Sixth Test Case**:
    - `n=12`, `f=621526648`, `a=2585904`, `b=3566299`, `m=[51789, 61859, 71998, 73401, 247675, 298086, 606959, 663464, 735972, 806043, 806459, 919683]`
    - Initial charge `f=621526648`
    - Process each interval and subtract the minimum charge consumption.
    - Remaining charge after all intervals is greater than 0.
    - Output: 'YES' (Correct)
