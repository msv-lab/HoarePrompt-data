Let's carefully analyze the program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

The program is structured to handle multiple test cases, and for each test case, it calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of the signs.

Here is the step-by-step logic of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. **Year Calculation**:
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0.
   - For each sign `i` (from 1 to n), it calculates the next occurrence of the sign as follows:
     - It finds the smallest multiple of `a_i` that is greater than `start_year`.
     - It updates `start_year` to this smallest multiple.
   - The formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is used to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than `start_year`. Here's a breakdown of the formula:
     - `(start_year + 1) // nums[x]` gives the integer division of `start_year + 1` by `nums[x]`, which is the largest integer `k` such that `k * nums[x] <= start_year`.
     - Adding 1 to this result gives the next integer `k+1` such that `(k+1) * nums[x] > start_year`.
     - Multiplying by `nums[x]` then gives the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.

3. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, it prints the final `start_year`, which is the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

Let's verify the formula with the first example:

- For the first sign, `start_year` is 0. The next multiple of 3 greater than 0 is 3.
- For the second sign, `start_year` is 3. The next multiple of 2 greater than 3 is 4.
- For the third sign, `start_year` is 4. The next multiple of 4 greater than 4 is 8.
- For the fourth sign, `start_year` is 8. The next multiple of 5 greater than 8 is 10.
- For the fifth sign, `start_year` is 10. The next multiple of 9 greater than 10 is 18.
- For the sixth sign, `start_year` is 18. The next multiple of 18 greater than 18 is 36.

The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur for this test case.

Given the logic and the example verification, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.
