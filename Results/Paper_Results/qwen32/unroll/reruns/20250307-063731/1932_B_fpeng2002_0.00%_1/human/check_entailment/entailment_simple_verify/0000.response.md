### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. We'll use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning.

#### Problem Recap:
- The Chaya tribe believes in `n` signs of the apocalypse.
- Each sign `i` occurs every `a_i` years.
- For the apocalypse to happen, signs must occur sequentially.
- If the `i-th` sign occurs in year `x`, the tribe waits for the `(i+1)-th` sign starting from year `x+1`.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads multiple test cases, each with a number of signs and their respective periodicities. It then calculates the year in which the `n-th` sign occurs and the apocalypse will happen.

#### Key Steps in the Program:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the number of signs `n`.
   - Read the list of periodicities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
   - Initialize `start_year` to 0.
   - For each sign, compute the next occurrence year:
     - `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`
   - Print the `start_year`, which is the year the `n-th` sign occurs.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The program initializes `start_year` to 0.
- For each periodicity `nums[x]`, it calculates the next occurrence year using the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

#### Example Test Case:
Let's consider the first test case from the problem statement:
- Input:
  ```
  6
  3 2 4 5 9 18
  ```
- Expected Output: `36`

The program calculates `start_year` as follows:
- For the first sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
- For the second sign: `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 6`
- For the third sign: `start_year = ((6 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
- For the fourth sign: `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
- For the fifth sign: `start_year = ((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
- For the sixth sign: `start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`

The calculations match the expected output for the first test case.

#### Validation of the Formula:
The formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` correctly computes the next occurrence year for each sign. Here's why:
- `(start_year + 1) // nums[x]` computes the number of full periods that have passed since `start_year + 1`.
- Adding 1 to this result gives the next period number.
- Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the year of the next occurrence.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly computes the year for the `n-th` sign in all test cases. The formula used to compute the next occurrence year is correct.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**. The program correctly computes the year for the `n-th` sign in all cases. The formula used to compute the next occurrence year is correct.
