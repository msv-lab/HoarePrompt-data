The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs. The number of test cases t is between 1 and 1000.
