Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and its annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate or needs to be overturned.

### Problem Recap:
- The Chaya tribe believes in `n` signs of the apocalypse.
- Each sign `i` occurs every `a_i` years.
- For the apocalypse to happen, signs must occur sequentially.
- If the `i-th` sign occurs in year `x`, the tribe waits for the `(i+1)-th` sign starting from year `x+1`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads multiple test cases, each with a number of signs and their respective periodicities. It then calculates the year in which the `n-th` sign occurs and the apocalypse will happen.

#### Key Steps in the Provided Program:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the number of signs `n`.
   - Read the list of periodicities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
   - Initialize `start_year` to 0.
   - For each sign, compute the next occurrence year:
     - `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`
   - Print the `start_year`, which is the year the `n-th` sign occurs.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
Let's examine the annotated code step by step to see if the logic aligns with the problem requirements.

#### Annotations:
- `num_tests` is the number of test cases.
- `n` is the number of signs for each test case.
- `nums` is the list of periodicities for each sign.
- `start_year` is initialized to 0.
- The loop iterates over each sign, updating `start_year` using the formula `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

### Correctness Evaluation:
Let's verify the correctness of the formula `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` using the example provided in the problem statement.

#### Example Test Case:
- Input:
  ```
  6
  3 2 4 5 9 18
  ```
- Expected Output: `36`

The provided program calculates `start_year` as follows:
- For the first sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
- For the second sign: `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 6`
- For the third sign: `start_year = ((6 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
- For the fourth sign: `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
- For the fifth sign: `start_year = ((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
- For the sixth sign: `start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`

The calculations match the expected output for this test case. Therefore, the formula used in the program seems to be correct.

### Additional Test Cases:
Let's verify the program with the other test cases provided in the problem statement.

#### Test Case 2:
- Input:
  ```
  5
  1 2 3 4 5
  ```
- Expected Output: `5`

Program Output:
- For the first sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2`
- For the second sign: `start_year = ((2 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
- For the third sign: `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 6`
- For the fourth sign: `start_year = ((6 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
- For the fifth sign: `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`

The calculations do not match the expected output. The correct formula should be `start_year = ((start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x])`.

#### Test Case 3:
- Input:
  ```
  5
  1 1 1 1 1
  ```
- Expected Output: `5`

Program Output:
- For the first sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2`
- For the second sign: `start_year = ((2 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 4`
- For the third sign: `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 6`
- For the fourth sign: `start_year = ((6 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 8`
- For the fifth sign: `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 10`

The calculations do not match the expected output. The correct formula should be `start_year = ((start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x])`.

#### Test Case 4:
- Input:
  ```
  6
  50 30 711 200 503 1006
  ```
- Expected Output: `2012`

Program Output:
- For the first sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`
- For the second sign: `start_year = ((50 + 1) // 30 + 1) * 30 = 80`
- For the third sign: `start_year = ((80 + 1) // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`
- For the fourth sign: `start_year = ((711 + 1) // 200 + 1) * 200 = 900`
- For the fifth sign: `start_year = ((900 + 1) // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`
- For the sixth sign: `start_year = ((1006 + 1) // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`

The calculations match the expected output for this test case. Therefore, the formula used in the program seems to be correct for some cases but incorrect for others.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is partially correct. The formula `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is not always correct. The correct formula should be `start_year = ((start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x])`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**. The program does not correctly compute the year for the `n-th` sign in all cases. The formula used to compute the next occurrence year is incorrect for some test cases.

Final: **False**
