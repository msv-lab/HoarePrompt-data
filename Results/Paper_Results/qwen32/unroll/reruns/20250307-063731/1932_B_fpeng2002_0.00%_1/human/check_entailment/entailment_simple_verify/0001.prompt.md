You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs. The number of test cases t is between 1 and 1000.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
- We have `n` signs, each occurring every `a_i` years.
- The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the next sign can only occur after the previous one.
- We need to find the year when the `n`-th sign occurs.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the periodicities of the signs.

The core logic of the program is in the loop:
```python
start_year = 0
for x in range(0, len(nums)):
    start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
print(start_year)
```

#### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: `start_year` is initialized to 0.
2. **Loop through each sign**:
   - For each sign, the program calculates the next occurrence year by:
     - Adding 1 to `start_year` (since the next sign can't occur in the same year as the previous one).
     - Dividing `start_year + 1` by `nums[x]` and taking the ceiling of the result (which is achieved by `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1)`).
     - Multiplying the result by `nums[x]` to get the next occurrence year.
3. **Output**: After processing all signs, the final `start_year` is printed, which represents the year the `n`-th sign occurs.

### Correctness Check:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **First example**:
   - Input: `6`, `[3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
   - Calculation:
     - `start_year = 0`
     - After 1st sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
     - After 2nd sign: `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
     - After 3rd sign: `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
     - After 4th sign: `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
     - After 5th sign: `start_year = ((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
     - After 6th sign: `start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
   - Output: `36` (matches the example)

2. **Second example**:
   - Input: `5`, `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - Calculation:
     - `start_year = 0`
     - After 1st sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2` (incorrect, should be 1)
     - The program incorrectly calculates the first sign's year as 2 instead of 1.
   - Output: `5` (incorrect, should be 5 but the first sign's year is wrong)

### Conclusion:
The program incorrectly handles the first sign's year in some cases, leading to incorrect results. For example, in the second test case, the first sign should occur in year 1, not year 2.

Thus, the program is not entirely correct for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
