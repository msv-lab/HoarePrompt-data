Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
- We have `n` signs, each occurring every `a_i` years.
- The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the next sign can only occur after the previous one.
- We need to find the year when the `n`-th sign occurs.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the periodicities of the signs.

The core logic of the program is in the loop:
```python
start_year = 0
for x in range(0, len(nums)):
    start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
print(start_year)
```

#### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: `start_year` is initialized to 0.
2. **Loop through each sign**:
   - For each sign, the program calculates the next occurrence year by:
     - Adding 1 to `start_year` (since the next sign can't occur in the same year as the previous one).
     - Dividing `start_year + 1` by `nums[x]` and taking the ceiling of the result (which is achieved by `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1)`).
     - Multiplying the result by `nums[x]` to get the next occurrence year.
3. **Output**: After processing all signs, the final `start_year` is printed, which represents the year the `n`-th sign occurs.

### Correctness Check:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **First example**:
   - Input: `6`, `[3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
   - Calculation:
     - `start_year = 0`
     - After 1st sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
     - After 2nd sign: `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
     - After 3rd sign: `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
     - After 4th sign: `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
     - After 5th sign: `start_year = ((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
     - After 6th sign: `start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
   - Output: `36` (matches the example)

2. **Second example**:
   - Input: `5`, `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - Calculation:
     - `start_year = 0`
     - After 1st sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2` (incorrect, should be 1)
     - The program incorrectly calculates the first sign's year as 2 instead of 1.
   - Output: `5` (incorrect, should be 5 but the first sign's year is wrong)

### Conclusion:
The program incorrectly handles the first sign's year in some cases, leading to incorrect results. For example, in the second test case, the first sign should occur in year 1, not year 2.

Thus, the program is not entirely correct for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
