Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- The Chaya tribe believes in `n` signs of the apocalypse.
- Each sign `i` occurs every `a_i` years.
- For the apocalypse to happen, signs must occur sequentially.
- If the `i-th` sign occurs in year `x`, the tribe waits for the `(i+1)-th` sign starting from year `x+1`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads multiple test cases, each with a number of signs and their respective periodicities. It then calculates the year in which the `n-th` sign occurs and the apocalypse will happen.

#### Key Steps in the Provided Program:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the number of signs `n`.
   - Read the list of periodicities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
   - Initialize `start_year` to 0.
   - For each sign, compute the next occurrence year:
     - `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`
   - Print the `start_year`, which is the year the `n-th` sign occurs.

#### Potential Issues:
The logic in the program seems to be incorrect. Specifically, the formula `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` does not accurately compute the next occurrence year for each sign.

### Correct Formula:
The correct way to compute the next occurrence year for each sign is:
- If the `i-th` sign occurred in `start_year`, the next occurrence of the `(i+1)-th` sign should be the smallest multiple of `a_(i+1)` that is greater than `start_year`.

The correct formula should be:
- `start_year = ((start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x])`

### Example Test Case:
Let's consider the first test case from the problem statement:
- Input:
  ```
  6
  3 2 4 5 9 18
  ```
- Expected Output: `36`

The provided program calculates `start_year` as follows:
- For the first sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
- For the second sign: `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 8`
- For the third sign: `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 12`
- For the fourth sign: `start_year = ((12 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 15`
- For the fifth sign: `start_year = ((15 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
- For the sixth sign: `start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`

However, the program does not correctly compute the year for the second sign. The correct calculation should be:
- For the second sign: `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 6` (not 8)

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly compute the year for the `n-th` sign in all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**. The program does not correctly compute the year for the `n-th` sign in all cases. The formula used to compute the next occurrence year is incorrect.
