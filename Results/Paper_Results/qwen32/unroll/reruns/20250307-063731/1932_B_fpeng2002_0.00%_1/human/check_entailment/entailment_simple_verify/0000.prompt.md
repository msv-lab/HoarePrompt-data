You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- The Chaya tribe believes in `n` signs of the apocalypse.
- Each sign `i` occurs every `a_i` years.
- For the apocalypse to happen, signs must occur sequentially.
- If the `i-th` sign occurs in year `x`, the tribe waits for the `(i+1)-th` sign starting from year `x+1`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads multiple test cases, each with a number of signs and their respective periodicities. It then calculates the year in which the `n-th` sign occurs and the apocalypse will happen.

#### Key Steps in the Provided Program:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the number of signs `n`.
   - Read the list of periodicities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
   - Initialize `start_year` to 0.
   - For each sign, compute the next occurrence year:
     - `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`
   - Print the `start_year`, which is the year the `n-th` sign occurs.

#### Potential Issues:
The logic in the program seems to be incorrect. Specifically, the formula `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` does not accurately compute the next occurrence year for each sign.

### Correct Formula:
The correct way to compute the next occurrence year for each sign is:
- If the `i-th` sign occurred in `start_year`, the next occurrence of the `(i+1)-th` sign should be the smallest multiple of `a_(i+1)` that is greater than `start_year`.

The correct formula should be:
- `start_year = ((start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x])`

### Example Test Case:
Let's consider the first test case from the problem statement:
- Input:
  ```
  6
  3 2 4 5 9 18
  ```
- Expected Output: `36`

The provided program calculates `start_year` as follows:
- For the first sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
- For the second sign: `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 8`
- For the third sign: `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 12`
- For the fourth sign: `start_year = ((12 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 15`
- For the fifth sign: `start_year = ((15 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
- For the sixth sign: `start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`

However, the program does not correctly compute the year for the second sign. The correct calculation should be:
- For the second sign: `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 6` (not 8)

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly compute the year for the `n-th` sign in all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**. The program does not correctly compute the year for the `n-th` sign in all cases. The formula used to compute the next occurrence year is incorrect.
