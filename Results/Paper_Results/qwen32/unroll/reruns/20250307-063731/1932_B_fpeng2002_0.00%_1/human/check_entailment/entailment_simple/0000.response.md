### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse will happen, based on the periodicity of each sign. The program processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes a number of signs and their respective periodicities.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases (`num_tests`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and their periodicities (`nums`).

2. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign**:
   - The program initializes `start_year` to 0.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence of the sign based on the current `start_year`.
   - The formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` ensures that the next occurrence of the sign is strictly after the current `start_year` and follows the periodicity `nums[x]`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the year when the n-th sign will occur.

### Verification Against Provided Example:

Let's verify the program's logic against the provided example to ensure correctness:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
   - Calculations:
     - Start year = 0
     - Year for 1st sign: `((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
     - Year for 2nd sign: `((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
     - Year for 3rd sign: `((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
     - Year for 4th sign: `((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
     - Year for 5th sign: `((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
     - Year for 6th sign: `((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
   - Output: `36`

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `5`, `1 2 3 4 5`
   - Calculations:
     - Start year = 0
     - Year for 1st sign: `((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2`
     - Year for 2nd sign: `((2 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
     - Year for 3rd sign: `((4 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 6`
     - Year for 4th sign: `((6 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
     - Year for 5th sign: `((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
   - Output: `5` (Note: The provided output in the example seems incorrect here; the correct output should be `10` based on the logic. However, the provided output is `5`.)

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `5`, `1 1 1 1 1`
   - Calculations:
     - Start year = 0
     - Year for 1st sign: `((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2`
     - Year for 2nd sign: `((2 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 4`
     - Year for 3rd sign: `((4 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 6`
     - Year for 4th sign: `((6 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 8`
     - Year for 5th sign: `((8 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 10`
   - Output: `5` (Note: The provided output in the example seems incorrect here; the correct output should be `10` based on the logic. However, the provided output is `5`.)

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `6`, `50 30 711 200 503 1006`
   - Calculations:
     - Start year = 0
     - Year for 1st sign: `((0 + 1) // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`
     - Year for 2nd sign: `((50 + 1) // 30 + 1) * 30 = 80`
     - Year for 3rd sign: `((80 + 1) // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`
     - Year for 4th sign: `((711 + 1) // 200 + 1) * 200 = 900`
     - Year for 5th sign: `((900 + 1) // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`
     - Year for 6th sign: `((1006 + 1) // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`
   - Output: `2012`

### Conclusion:
