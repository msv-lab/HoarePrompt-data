Reasoning:

The program provided is designed to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur sequentially for each test case. Let's break down the logic and verify if it aligns with the problem description.

1. **Initialization**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0, which represents the starting year for the first sign.
   - It iterates through each sign's periodicity `a_i`.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by:
     - Incrementing `start_year` by 1 to account for the requirement that the next sign must occur strictly after the previous one.
     - Finding the next multiple of `a_i` that is greater than or equal to `start_year + 1` using the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
     - This formula ensures that `start_year` is updated to the next occurrence year of the current sign.

3. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, it prints the final `start_year`, which represents the year in which the n-th sign will occur.

The logic correctly implements the requirement that each sign must occur strictly after the previous one. The formula used to find the next occurrence year is mathematically sound and ensures that the sequence of signs is respected.

Given the example provided in the problem statement, the program produces the correct output for each test case, which further supports its correctness.

Correctness: **True**
