Reasoning: The given program aims to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given that each sign must occur sequentially according to their periodicities. The program reads multiple test cases, where for each test case, it calculates the year of the n-th sign's occurrence based on the rules provided.

The logic in the program is as follows:
1. For each test case, it initializes `start_year` to 0.
2. It iterates through the list of periodicities (`nums`).
3. For each periodicity `nums[x]`, it calculates the next occurrence of the sign after `start_year` by finding the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`. This is done using the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, which finds the next multiple of `nums[x]` after `start_year`.
4. It updates `start_year` to this new value, effectively moving to the next sign's occurrence year.
5. After processing all signs for a test case, it prints the final `start_year`, which is the year the n-th sign will occur.

The logic correctly implements the problem's requirements. The formula used to find the next occurrence of each sign is appropriate and ensures that the signs occur sequentially as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
