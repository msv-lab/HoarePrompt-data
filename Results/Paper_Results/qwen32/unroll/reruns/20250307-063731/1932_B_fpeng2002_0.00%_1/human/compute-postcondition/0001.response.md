The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `num_tests` is greater than 0. Given that `num_tests` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `num_tests` ≤ 1000, it is already guaranteed that `num_tests` will be greater than 0.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed to ensure that the loop can execute the first time. The state remains the same.

State: **`num_tests` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `num_tests` ≤ 1000**
