Output State: **The program returns the value of `end - start + 1 - count_num` if `end - start + 1` is greater than or equal to `count_num`, otherwise it returns 0.**

This means the program calculates the difference between `end` and `start`, adds 1 to it, and then subtracts `count_num`. If the result is non-negative, it returns that value. If the result is negative, it returns 0.
