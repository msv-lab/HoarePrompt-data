To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to analyze how the loop modifies the variables based on the given conditions.

The loop iterates `n` times, and in each iteration, it reads two integers `t` and `v`. Depending on the value of `t`, it updates `start`, `end`, or `num`:
- If `t` is 1, it updates `start` to `v` if `start` is less than `v`.
- If `t` is 2, it updates `end` to `v` if `end` is greater than `v`.
- If `t` is 3, it appends `v` to the list `num`.

After `n` iterations, the final values of `start`, `end`, and `num` will be:
- `start`: The maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1.
- `end`: The minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2.
- `num`: A list containing all the values of `v` encountered when `t` is 3.

The variables `n`, `t`, and `v` are not retained after the loop, and `start` and `end` retain their initial values if no updates were made during the loop.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1 (or -1 if no such `v` was encountered), `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2 (or 1000000000.0 if no such `v` was encountered), `num` is a list of all `v` values encountered when `t` is 3, `t` is an integer that can be 1, 2, or 3, and `v` is an integer such that 1 <= v <= 10^9.**
