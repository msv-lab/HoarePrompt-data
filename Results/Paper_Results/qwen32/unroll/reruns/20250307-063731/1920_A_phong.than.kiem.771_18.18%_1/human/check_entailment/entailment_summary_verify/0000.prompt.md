You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 7 : The function reads a series of commands, each consisting of a type and a value. It updates the maximum value encountered for type 1 commands, the minimum value for type 2 commands, and collects values for type 3 commands. It then calculates and returns the number of integers within the range defined by the maximum and minimum values that were not collected in type 3 commands, or 0 if the range is invalid or insufficiently large.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program contains a logical error in the way it calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. Specifically, it incorrectly handles the case where the range of valid values for `k` does not overlap with the excluded values.

Let's analyze the problematic part of the code:

```python
if start > end:
    return 0
return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0
```

The issue arises when `end - start + 1` is less than `count_num`. In such cases, the program should return `0` because there are no valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. However, the current code returns `end - start + 1 - count_num`, which can be a negative number, but it is clamped to `0` by the conditional expression. This is fine, but the logic should be clearer and more robust.

However, the more critical issue is when `end - start + 1` is exactly equal to `count_num`. In this case, if all numbers in the range `[start, end]` are excluded, the program should return `0`, but it incorrectly returns `end - start + 1 - count_num`, which is `0`. This is not incorrect per se, but it's not clear and could be misleading.

The main problem is that the program does not correctly handle the scenario where the range of valid values for `k` is completely excluded by the `k != x` constraints. For example:

Input:
```
1
3
1 5
2 5
3 5
```

Expected Output:
```
0
```

Actual Output:
```
1
```

In this case, `k` must be `5` (from `1 5` and `2 5`), but `k` cannot be `5` (from `3 5`). Therefore, there are no valid integers `k`, and the output should be `0`.

To fix this, the program should explicitly check if the range `[start, end]` is completely excluded by the `k != x` constraints. Here is a corrected version of the relevant part of the code:

```python
if start > end:
    return 0

valid_range = end - start + 1
excluded_count = sum(1 for num in num if start <= num <= end)

if valid_range <= excluded_count:
    return 0

return valid_range - excluded_count
```

This ensures that if the number of excluded values within the valid range is greater than or equal to the size of the valid range, the function returns `0`.
