The code snippet provided does not change any of the variables' values since it assigns the variable `end` the value it already holds. Therefore, the state remains unchanged except for the explicit assignment, which is redundant.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is a list that will store integers, `t` is an integer that can be 1, 2, or 3, and `v` is an integer such that 1 <= v <= 10^9.**
