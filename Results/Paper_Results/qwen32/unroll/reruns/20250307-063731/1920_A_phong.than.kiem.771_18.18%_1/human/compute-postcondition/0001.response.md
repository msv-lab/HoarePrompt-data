The code snippet sets the variable `start` to -1. The other variables (`n`, `end`, `num`, `t`, and `v`) are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is a list that will store integers, `t` is an integer that can be 1, 2, or 3, and `v` is an integer such that 1 <= v <= 10^9.**
