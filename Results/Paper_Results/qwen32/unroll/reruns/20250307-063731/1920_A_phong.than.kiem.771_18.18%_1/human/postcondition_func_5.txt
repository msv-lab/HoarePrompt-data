The function `func_6` searches through a list of lists (`arr`) for a sublist that contains a specific value (`value`) at a specified position (`index`). If such a sublist is found, it is returned. If no such sublist exists, the function returns `None`. The input parameters `arr`, `index`, and `value` remain unchanged.
