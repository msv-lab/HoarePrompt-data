The function reads a series of commands, each consisting of a type and a value. It updates the maximum value encountered for type 1 commands, the minimum value for type 2 commands, and collects values for type 3 commands. It then calculates and returns the number of integers within the range defined by the maximum and minimum values that were not collected in type 3 commands, or 0 if the range is invalid or insufficiently large.
