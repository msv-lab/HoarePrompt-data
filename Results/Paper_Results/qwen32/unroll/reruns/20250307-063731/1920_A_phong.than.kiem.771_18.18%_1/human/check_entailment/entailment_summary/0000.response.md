### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function reads the number of test cases. It correctly reads the integer input when `isOne` is `False`. Since `isOne` is not provided in the main loop, it defaults to `False`, which is correct for reading the number of test cases.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and returns the list of integers. This function is not used directly in the provided code snippet, but it seems to be a utility function that could be used for reading constraints in a different format.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function concatenates elements of a list into a single string with a specified delimiter. It is not used in the provided code snippet.

4. **Function `func_4`**: This function finds all starting indices of a substring within a string. It is not used in the provided code snippet.

5. **Function `func_5`**: This function finds all indices of a specific element in a list. It is not used in the provided code snippet.

6. **Function `func_6`**: This function searches for a sublist containing a specific value at a specific index. It is not used in the provided code snippet.

7. **Function `func_7`**: This function processes each test case. It reads the number of constraints, then processes each constraint to determine the valid range for `k` (using `start` and `end`). It also collects numbers that `k` must not be equal to. Finally, it calculates the number of valid integers within the range `[start, end]` that are not in the collected `num` list. If the range is invalid (`start > end`), it returns 0.

### Analysis:

- **Range Calculation**: `func_7` correctly calculates the range `[start, end]` by updating `start` for type 1 constraints and `end` for type 2 constraints.
- **Exclusion of Specific Values**: `func_7` correctly counts the number of integers in the range `[start, end]` that must be excluded (type 3 constraints).
- **Final Count**: The final count of valid integers is calculated as `end - start + 1 - count_num`, ensuring that excluded values are subtracted from the total possible values in the range.
- **Edge Cases**: The function handles cases where `start > end` by returning 0, indicating no valid integers exist.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
