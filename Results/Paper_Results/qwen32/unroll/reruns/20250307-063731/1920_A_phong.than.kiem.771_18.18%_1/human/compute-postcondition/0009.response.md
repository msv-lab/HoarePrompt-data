Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1 (or -1 if no such `v` was encountered), `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2 (or 1000000000.0 if no such `v` was encountered), `num` is a list of all `v` values encountered when `t` is 3, `t` is an integer that can be 1, 2, or 3, and `v` is an integer such that 1 <= v <= 10^9, `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]`. The current value of `start` is greater than the current value of `end`.**
