You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 7 : The function reads a series of commands, each consisting of a type and a value. It updates the maximum value encountered for type 1 commands, the minimum value for type 2 commands, and collects values for type 3 commands. It then calculates and returns the number of integers within the range defined by the maximum and minimum values that were not collected in type 3 commands, or 0 if the range is invalid or insufficiently large.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) using `func_1()`, which is a custom function that reads an integer from input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints (`n`), and then reads `n` constraints. Each constraint is a pair of integers (type and value).

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - It initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to 1,000,000,000 (which is the maximum possible value for `x`).
   - It iterates over each constraint:
     - If the constraint type is 1 (`k >= x`), it updates `start` to the maximum of its current value and `x`.
     - If the constraint type is 2 (`k <= x`), it updates `end` to the minimum of its current value and `x`.
     - If the constraint type is 3 (`k != x`), it adds `x` to a list `num` of numbers that `k` cannot be.

3. **Counting Invalid `k` Values**:
   - It counts how many numbers in `num` are within the range `[start, end]` (inclusive). These are the numbers that `k` cannot be.
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, it means there are no valid `k` values, so it returns 0.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the total number of valid `k` values as `end - start + 1` and subtracts the count of invalid `k` values (`count_num`).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there are no valid `k` values (i.e., `start > end`), it correctly returns 0.
   - It handles the case where the range of valid `k` values is smaller than the number of invalid `k` values within that range by returning 0.

### Verification Against Example Input

Let's verify the program against the provided example inputs:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Constraints: `k >= 3`, `k <= 10`, `k != 1`, `k != 5`
   - `start = 3`, `end = 10`
   - Invalid `k` values in range: `5`
   - Valid `k` values: `7` (3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
   - Output: `7`

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Constraints: `k >= 5`, `k <= 4`
   - `start = 5`, `end = 4`
   - `start > end`, so output: `0`

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Constraints: `k != 6`, `k != 7`, `k >= 2`, `k >= 7`, `k != 100`, `k != 44`, `k <= 100`, `k <= 98`
   - `start = 7`, `end = 98`
   - Invalid `k` values in range: `6, 7, 44`
   - Valid `k` values: `90` (7, 8, ..., 98 excluding 6, 7, 44)
   - Output: `90`

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Constraints: `k >= 5`, `k <= 10`, `k >= 9`, `k <= 2`, `k != 2`, `k != 9`
   - `start = 9`, `end = 2`
   - `start > end`, so output: `0`

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - Constraints: `k >= 1`, `k <= 2`, `k != 1`, `k != 2`, `k != 3`
   - `start = 1`, `end = 2`
   - Invalid `k` values in range: `1, 2`
   - Valid `k` values: `0`
   - Output: `0`

6. **Sixth Test Case**:
   - Constraints: `k >= 10000`, `k <= 900000000`, `k != 500000000`, `k >= 100000000`, `k != 10000`, `k != 900000001`
   - `start = 100000000`, `end = 900000000`
   - Invalid `k` values in range: `10000, 500000000`
   - Valid `k` values: `800000000` (100000000, 100000001, ..., 900000000 excluding 10000, 500000000)
   - Output: `800000000`

### Conclusion

The program correctly processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid `k` values for each test case. It handles edge cases appropriately and produces the correct output for the provided examples.
