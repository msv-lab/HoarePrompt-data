### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python code and the functions within it to determine if the program correctly solves the problem as described:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is not actually used in the provided code snippet. It is supposed to read an integer from input or return 1 based on the `isOne` parameter. However, in the main code, `func_1()` is called without arguments, which would result in an error. Since `func_1` is not used, we can ignore it for now.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads a line of input and splits it into either words or characters, converting them to integers if `to_int` is `True`. It's not used in the main code snippet, so we can ignore it as well.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function concatenates a list of integers into a single string with a specified symbol between each integer. It's not used in the main code snippet, so we can ignore it.

4. **Function `func_4`**: This function finds all starting indices of a substring within a string. It's not used in the main code snippet, so we can ignore it.

5. **Function `func_5`**: This function returns a list of indices where a specific element appears in a list. It's not used in the main code snippet, so we can ignore it.

6. **Function `func_6`**: This function searches for a sublist within a list of lists that contains a specific value at a given index. It's not used in the main code snippet, so we can ignore it.

7. **Function `func_7`**: This function is used in the main code snippet. It reads the number of constraints `n`, then for each constraint, it updates the `start` and `end` values based on the type of constraint (type 1 or type 2) and collects values for type 3 constraints. After processing all constraints, it calculates the number of integers in the range `[start, end]` that are not in the `num` list (type 3 constraints).

### Analysis of `func_7`:

- **Initialization**: `start` is initialized to `-1` and `end` to `1000000000.0`.
- **Processing Constraints**:
  - For type 1 constraints (k ≥ x), it updates `start` to the maximum of the current `start` and `x`.
  - For type 2 constraints (k ≤ x), it updates `end` to the minimum of the current `end` and `x`.
  - For type 3 constraints (k ≠ x), it appends `x` to the `num` list.
- **Counting Valid k Values**:
  - It counts how many values in `num` are within the range `[start, end]`.
  - If `start > end`, it returns `0` because the range is invalid.
  - Otherwise, it calculates the number of integers in the range `[start, end]` that are not in `num` using the formula `end - start + 1 - count_num`.

### Verification:

The logic in `func_7` correctly implements the problem requirements. It correctly updates the range based on type 1 and type 2 constraints and ensures that the final range is valid. It then counts the number of integers within this range that are not excluded by type 3 constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program, as described by the function `func_7`, correctly solves the problem as specified. Therefore:

**Correctness: True**
