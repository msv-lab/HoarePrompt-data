The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `count_num` to 0. This operation does not affect the values of the existing variables `n`, `start`, `end`, `num`, `t`, or `v`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1 (or -1 if no such `v` was encountered), `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2 (or 1000000000.0 if no such `v` was encountered), `num` is a list of all `v` values encountered when `t` is 3, `t` is an integer that can be 1, 2, or 3, and `v` is an integer such that 1 <= v <= 10^9, `count_num` is 0.**
