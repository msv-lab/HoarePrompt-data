### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify if it correctly solves the problem described.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - It then reads `n` constraints, each represented by a type `a` and a value `x`.

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - `start` is initialized to -1 and `end` to 1000000000.0.
   - `num` is initialized as an empty list to store values that `k` must not be equal to.
   - For each constraint:
     - If `a == 1`, `start` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `x`.
     - If `a == 2`, `end` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `x`.
     - If `a == 3`, `x` is appended to the list `num`.
   - After processing all constraints, `start` will be the smallest possible value for `k` (from constraints of type 1), and `end` will be the largest possible value for `k` (from constraints of type 2).

3. **Counting Valid `k` Values:**
   - The program counts how many values in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]` and stores this count in `count_num`.
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, it means there are no valid values for `k`, and the program returns 0.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of integers in the range `[start, end]` that are not in `num` by subtracting `count_num` from the total number of integers in the range (`end - start + 1`).

4. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the number of valid `k` values for each test case.

### Verification:

- **Correctness of Range Calculation:**
  - The program correctly identifies the range `[start, end]` as the valid range for `k` based on constraints of type 1 and type 2.
  
- **Correctness of Exclusion of Forbidden Values:**
  - The program correctly counts and excludes values in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles cases where `start > end` by returning 0, which is correct as no valid `k` can exist in such a scenario.
  - The program also handles large values of `end` and small values of `start` correctly, as the range calculation and exclusion logic are independent of the magnitude of these values.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
