The code snippet `n = int(input())` will read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100`, the value of `n` will be updated to whatever integer the user inputs, still ensuring it falls within this range. The other variables (`start`, `end`, `num`, `t`, and `v`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100 (as input by the user), `start` is an integer initialized to -1, `end` is a float initialized to 1000000000.0, `num` is a list that will store integers, `t` is an integer that can be 1, 2, or 3, and `v` is an integer such that 1 <= v <= 10^9.**
