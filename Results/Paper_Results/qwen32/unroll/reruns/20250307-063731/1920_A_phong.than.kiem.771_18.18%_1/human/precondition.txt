isOne is a boolean value indicating whether the input is for a single test case (if True) or multiple test cases (if False). The function is expected to handle input parsing for the problem, where the input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints, followed by n lines of constraints. Each constraint is described by two integers a (1 ≤ a ≤ 3) and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), where a denotes the type of constraint (1 for k ≥ x, 2 for k ≤ x, and 3 for k ≠ x). It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.
