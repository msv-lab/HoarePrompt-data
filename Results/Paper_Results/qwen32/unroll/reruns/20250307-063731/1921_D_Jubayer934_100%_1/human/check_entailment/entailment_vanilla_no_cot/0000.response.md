Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly find the maximum difference D that can be obtained. The logic for selecting elements from array `b` to maximize the difference is flawed. The program only partially considers the optimal selection of elements from `b` and does not ensure that the maximum possible difference is achieved for all elements in `a`.

To maximize the difference, Vasya should select the smallest elements from `b` to pair with the largest elements from `a` and the largest elements from `b` to pair with the smallest elements from `a`. The current program does not implement this strategy consistently.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        # Pair the smallest elements of a with the largest elements of b
        ans = sum(abs(a[i] - b[m - 1 - i]) for i in range(n // 2))
        # Pair the largest elements of a with the smallest elements of b
        ans += sum(abs(a[i] - b[i]) for i in range(n // 2, n))
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version sorts `a` and `b`, then pairs the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b` and the largest elements of `a` with the smallest elements of `b` to maximize the total difference `D`.
