### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem. The goal is to maximize the total difference \(D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i|\) by choosing and arranging \(n\) integers from the list \(b_i\) to form the list \(c_i\).

1. **Sorting and Selection:**
   - The program sorts the list \(a_i\) in ascending order.
   - It also sorts the list \(b_i\) in descending order.

2. **Greedy Pairing Strategy:**
   - The program then iterates through the first \(n\) elements of the sorted \(a_i\) and \(b_i\) and calculates the absolute differences.
   - It checks if the difference between the current element of \(a_i\) and the element from the end of the sorted \(b_i\) is greater than the difference with the corresponding element from the start of the sorted \(b_i\).
   - If such a condition is found, it switches to pairing the remaining elements of \(a_i\) with the corresponding elements from the end of the sorted \(b_i\).

3. **Summing Differences:**
   - The program accumulates the absolute differences and prints the total sum for each test case.

### Key Observations:

- **Sorting \(a_i\) in ascending order and \(b_i\) in descending order** ensures that the potential differences are maximized because larger values from \(b_i\) are paired with smaller values from \(a_i\) and vice versa.
- **Greedy Strategy:** The strategy of switching to pairing from the end of the sorted \(b_i\) when a larger difference is found ensures that the maximum possible differences are considered.
- **Efficiency:** The program efficiently handles the constraints by sorting the lists and iterating through them linearly, making it suitable for the input size limits.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to maximize the total difference \(D\) by strategically pairing elements from the two lists. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
