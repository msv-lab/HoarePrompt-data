In the given task, the loop is controlled by the variable `_` and the range function, which takes an integer input. The loop will execute for each test case, where the number of test cases is specified by the integer `t`. The loop head only contains the variable `_` and the range function, which depends on the input value.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to ensure that the input to the `range` function is greater than 0. Since `t` is the number of test cases and it is given that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, the loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. 

The variables `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` are part of the loop body and are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts only needs to ensure that `t` is at least 1. Since it is already given that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, no adjustment is needed for `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100**
