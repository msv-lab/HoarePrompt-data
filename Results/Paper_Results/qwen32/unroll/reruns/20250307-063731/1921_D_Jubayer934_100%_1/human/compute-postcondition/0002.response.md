Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `m`, and two lists `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. Each element in `a` and `b` is an integer. The function returns a result for each test case based on the provided lists `a` and `b`.**
