### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the total difference \( D \) between two arrays, \( a \) and \( c \), where \( c \) is constructed from a subset of \( b \). Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic and correctness:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases, \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( m \), the sizes of arrays \( a \) and \( b \) respectively.
   - It then reads the arrays \( a \) and \( b \).

2. **Sorting:**
   - Array \( a \) is sorted in ascending order.
   - Array \( b \) is sorted in descending order.

3. **Constructing the Array \( c \):**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the absolute differences.
   - It iterates over the first \( n \) elements of the sorted \( a \) and \( b \) arrays.
   - For each element in \( a \), it compares the absolute difference between the current element of \( a \) and the corresponding element from the start of \( b \) (smallest) versus the corresponding element from the end of \( b \) (largest).
   - If the difference with the largest element of \( b \) is greater, it switches to using the largest elements of \( b \) from that point onwards.

4. **Calculating the Sum of Differences:**
   - The program calculates the sum of the absolute differences and prints it for each test case.

### Correctness:

The approach ensures that for each element in \( a \), the difference is maximized by choosing the most extreme available element from \( b \). The program correctly handles the logic of switching to the largest elements of \( b \) when it is beneficial to do so. This ensures that the total difference \( D \) is maximized.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference \( D \) as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness: **True**
