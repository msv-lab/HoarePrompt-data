Reasoning: 

The program is intended to maximize the total difference \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \) by selecting and arranging \( n \) integers from the list \( b \) to form the array \( c \).

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:
1. For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \) and \( m \).
2. It then reads the list \( a \) and sorts it in ascending order.
3. It reads the list \( b \) and sorts it in descending order.
4. The program aims to create the array \( c \) by comparing elements of the sorted \( a \) and the sorted \( b \) (from both ends) to maximize the absolute differences.
5. It iterates through the first \( n \) elements of the sorted \( a \) and compares the absolute difference between each element \( a[i] \) and the corresponding elements from the start and end of the sorted \( b \). It breaks the loop when it finds an optimal pairing that maximizes the difference.
6. If an optimal pairing is found, the program continues to use the optimal pairing for the remaining elements.
7. Finally, it prints the sum of the absolute differences.

The logic seems correct based on the problem description. The program correctly sorts the lists and compares elements to maximize the differences. It also handles the case where the optimal pairing starts from a certain point and continues optimally thereafter.

Correctness: **True**
