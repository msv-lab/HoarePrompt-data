Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives two lists of integers, `a` and `b`, and calculates the sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements of the sorted `a` and a specially ordered `b`. The ordering of `b` involves comparing elements from the start and end to determine the optimal pairing with `a`. The result for each test case is printed as the sum of these absolute differences.**
