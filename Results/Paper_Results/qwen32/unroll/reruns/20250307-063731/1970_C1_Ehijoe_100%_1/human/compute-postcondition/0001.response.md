The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `edges`. The variables `n` and `t` are not affected by this code snippet and retain their initial values. Since `edges` was previously undefined, it is now an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list.**
