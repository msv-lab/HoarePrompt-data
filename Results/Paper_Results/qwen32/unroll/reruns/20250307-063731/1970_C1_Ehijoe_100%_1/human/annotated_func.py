#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, t is an integer and t=1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing the edges of the tree where 1 <= u, v <= n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers (u_1) representing the starting node for the stone where 1 <= u_1 <= n.
def func_1():
    n, t = map(int, input().split())
    edges = []
    empty = True
    nodes = defaultdict(list)
    for i in range(n - 1):

    #State: `tree` is `[s, e]`, `prev` is `s`, `curr` is `e`, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is `0` if `start` is `s`, or `1` if `start` is `e`, `moves` is `[0, n - 1]` if `start` is `s`, or `[1, n - 2]` if `start` is `e`. There is at least one odd number in `moves` if the condition `any([move % 2 == 1 for move in moves])` is true, otherwise all elements in `moves` are even numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input describing a tree with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges, where the tree has exactly two leaves, and a starting node. It determines whether a player named Ron or Hermione wins a game based on the parity of the distances from the starting node to the two leaves of the tree. The function prints 'Ron' if at least one of these distances is odd, otherwise it prints 'Hermione'.
