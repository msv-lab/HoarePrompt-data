Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True.**

Natural language explanation: The value of `n` remains an integer read from input within the specified range. The value of `t` remains 1. The `edges` list remains empty. A new variable `empty` is introduced and set to True.
