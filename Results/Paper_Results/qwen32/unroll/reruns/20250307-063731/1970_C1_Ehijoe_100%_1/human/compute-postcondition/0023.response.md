Postcondition: **`tree` is `[s, e]`, `prev` is `s`, `curr` is `e`, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is `0` if `start` is `s`, or `1` if `start` is `e`, `moves` is `[0, n - 1]` if `start` is `s`, or `[1, n - 2]` if `start` is `e`. There is at least one odd number in `moves` if the condition `any([move % 2 == 1 for move in moves])` is true, otherwise all elements in `moves` are even numbers.**
