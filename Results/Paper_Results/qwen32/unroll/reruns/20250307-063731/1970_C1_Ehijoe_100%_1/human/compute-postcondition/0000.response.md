The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `t`. Given the initial state, `n` is already an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `t` is already an integer with a value of 1. The code will update the values of `n` and `t` based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is an integer read from input (which is expected to be 1 based on the problem description)**.

In simpler terms, `n` and `t` are updated to the values read from the input, with `t` expected to remain 1. The conditions on `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) still hold.
