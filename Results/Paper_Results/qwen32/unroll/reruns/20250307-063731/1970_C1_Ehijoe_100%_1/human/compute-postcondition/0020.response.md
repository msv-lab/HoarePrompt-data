Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

**Initial State:**
- `tree` is `[s, e]`, where `s` and `e` are some elements (likely integers or other objects).
- `prev` is `s`.
- `curr` is `e`.
- `start` is an input integer, which can be either `s` or `e`.
- `idx` is `0` if `start` is `s`, or `1` if `start` is `e`.
- `moves` is `[0, n - 1]` if `start` is `s`, or `[1, n - 2]` if `start` is `e`, where `n` is some integer.
- There is at least one odd number in `moves`.

**Print Statement:**
```python
print('Ron')
```

**Analysis:**
The print statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `tree`, `prev`, `curr`, `start`, `idx`, or `moves`. The string `'Ron'` is directly printed out regardless of the values of these variables.

**Output:**
Output: **Ron**
