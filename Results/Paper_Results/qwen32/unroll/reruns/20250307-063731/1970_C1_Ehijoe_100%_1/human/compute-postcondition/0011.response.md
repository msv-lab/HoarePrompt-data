The code snippet assigns the value of `s` to `prev`. Therefore, `prev` now holds the same value as `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node and its value is a list of adjacent nodes, `ends` is a list containing nodes with exactly one adjacent node, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the single element `s`, `prev` is equal to `s`.**
