The variable `start` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables `tree`, `prev`, and `curr` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`tree` is `[s, e]`, `prev` is `s`, `curr` is `e`, `start` is an input integer.**
