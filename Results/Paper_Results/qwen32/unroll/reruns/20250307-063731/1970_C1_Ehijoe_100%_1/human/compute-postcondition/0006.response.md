The code snippet provided initializes a new empty list named `ends`. This action does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`, or `nodes`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the `ends` list, which is now an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node and its value is a list of adjacent nodes, `ends` is an empty list.**
