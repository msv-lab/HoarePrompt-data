Functionality: **The function reads input describing a tree with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges, where the tree has exactly two leaves, and a starting node. It determines whether a player named Ron or Hermione wins a game based on the parity of the distances from the starting node to the two leaves of the tree. The function prints 'Ron' if at least one of these distances is odd, otherwise it prints 'Hermione'.**
