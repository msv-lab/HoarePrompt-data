The code snippet `idx = tree.index(start)` finds the index of the value `start` within the list `tree`. Given the initial state, `tree` is `[s, e]`, and `start` is an input integer. The variable `idx` will be assigned the index of `start` in `tree`.

There are two possible scenarios:
1. If `start` is equal to `s`, then `idx` will be `0`.
2. If `start` is equal to `e`, then `idx` will be `1`.

The values of `tree`, `prev`, and `curr` remain unchanged. The only change is the assignment of `idx`.

Output State: **`tree` is `[s, e]`, `prev` is `s`, `curr` is `e`, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is `0` if `start` is `s`, or `1` if `start` is `e`.**
