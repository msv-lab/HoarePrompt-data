To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's analyze the given code and the initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` is an integer read from input such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
- `t` is 1.
- `edges` is an empty list.
- `empty` is True.
- `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node and its value is a list of adjacent nodes.
- `ends` is a list containing nodes with exactly one adjacent node.
- `s` is the first element of `ends`.
- `e` is the second element of `ends`.
- `tree` is a list containing the single element `s`.
- `prev` is equal to `s`.
- `curr` is equal to `e`.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop runs while `curr` is not equal to `e`. However, the condition `while curr != e` is initially false because `curr` is set to `e` at the start. Therefore, the loop body does not execute at all.

### Output State:
Since the loop does not execute, the values of `tree`, `prev`, and `curr` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state for these variables.

Output State: **`tree` is `[s]`, `prev` is `s`, `curr` is `e`.**

In natural language, this means that the `tree` list still only contains the starting node `s`, `prev` is still the starting node `s`, and `curr` is still the ending node `e`. The loop did not modify these variables because the loop condition was not met.
