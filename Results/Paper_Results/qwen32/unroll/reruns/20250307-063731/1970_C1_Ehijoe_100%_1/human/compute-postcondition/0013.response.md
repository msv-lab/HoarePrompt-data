The `while` loop condition is `curr != e`. For the loop to execute at least once, `curr` must not be equal to `e` right before the loop starts. However, according to the provided state, `curr` is equal to `e`. Therefore, we need to adjust the value of `curr` to something other than `e` to ensure the loop can execute.

Let's break it down:

- The loop will only execute if `curr` is not equal to `e`.
- Given that `curr` is currently equal to `e`, we need to change `curr` to any value other than `e`.

Since `curr` is supposed to be a node, and `s` is a different node (the first element of `ends`), we can set `curr` to `s` to satisfy the loop condition.

State: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node and its value is a list of adjacent nodes, `ends` is a list containing nodes with exactly one adjacent node, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the single element `s`, `prev` is equal to `s`, `curr` is equal to `s`**
