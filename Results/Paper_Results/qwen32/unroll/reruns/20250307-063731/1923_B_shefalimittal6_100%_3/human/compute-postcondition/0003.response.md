Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `a`, a list of integers representing the health of each monster; `x`, a list of integers representing the initial positions of each monster such that -n <= x[i] < x[i+1] <= n for all i; and `k`, an integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired in one second. The function returns the minimum time required to defeat all the monsters, considering the constraints on the number of bullets that can be fired per second.**
