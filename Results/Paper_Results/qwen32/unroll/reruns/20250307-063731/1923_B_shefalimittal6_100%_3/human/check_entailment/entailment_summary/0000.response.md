### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided functions in the context of the problem statement:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is designed to determine if it is possible to kill all monsters without letting any of them reach the character (position 0).
   - It sorts the indices of the monsters based on their distance from the character.
   - It iterates through the sorted list, ensuring that it does not shoot multiple monsters at the same distance in the same second.
   - For each monster, it shoots up to `k` bullets per second, reducing the monster's health by 1 per bullet.
   - If a monster's health drops to 0, it is considered dead and removed from the list of targets for that second.
   - The function returns `False` if any monster reaches the character (distance becomes 0) before being killed.
   - The function returns `True` if all monsters are killed before any reach the character.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles the input reading and output for multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of monsters `n` and the maximum number of bullets `k`.
   - It then reads the health `a` and positions `x` of the monsters.
   - It uses `func_1` to determine if the monsters can be killed under the given constraints and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

### Analysis:

- **Sorting by Distance**: Sorting the monsters by their distance from the character ensures that the function prioritizes shooting monsters that are closer to the character, which is a logical strategy to prevent any monster from reaching the character.
- **Bullet Allocation**: The function uses a greedy approach to allocate bullets, shooting up to `k` bullets per second, and prioritizes reducing the health of the closest monsters first.
- **Checking Distance**: The check `if abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance` ensures that no monster can reach the character (distance 0) in the current second.
- **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating through each one and using `func_1` to determine the result for each.

### Conclusion:

The provided functions together correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
