Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from the input. For each test case, it reads the number of monsters `n` and the maximum number of bullets `k` that can be fired in one second. It then reads two lists: `a`, which contains the health of each monster, and `x`, which contains the initial positions of each monster. The function determines if it is possible to defeat all the monsters given the constraints and prints 'YES' if it is possible, otherwise 'NO'.**
