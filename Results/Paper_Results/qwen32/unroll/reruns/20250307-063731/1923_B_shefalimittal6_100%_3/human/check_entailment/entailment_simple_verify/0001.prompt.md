You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine if we can kill all monsters before they reach the character's position (0) on a line. Each second, we can fire up to `k` bullets, each reducing a monster's health by 1. After firing, any monster with health 0 or less dies, and all remaining monsters move one step closer to the character.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, x, k)`: This function determines if it's possible to kill all monsters before they reach the character, given their health (`a`), positions (`x`), and the number of bullets we can fire per second (`k`).
2. `func_2()`: This function reads input for multiple test cases and uses `func_1()` to determine the result for each case.

#### Function `func_1(a, x, k)`:
- **Sorting**: The function sorts the indices of the monsters based on their absolute distance from the character (0). This ensures that we prioritize monsters that are closer to the character.
- **Distance Tracking**: It tracks the distance of monsters from the character using the `distance` variable.
- **Loop**: It iterates through the sorted list of monsters.
  - **Check Distance**: If a monster's distance equals the current `distance`, it means the monster has reached the character, and we return `False`.
  - **Firing Bullets**: For each monster, it fires bullets to reduce its health until either the monster dies or we run out of bullets (`k`).
  - **Increment Distance**: After processing all monsters at the current distance, it increments the `distance` by 1.
- **Return True**: If we process all monsters without any of them reaching the character, it returns `True`.

### Correctness Check:
The logic in `func_1` is sound. It correctly prioritizes monsters based on their distance and ensures that we use the bullets efficiently. If a monster reaches the character at any point, it correctly returns `False`. If all monsters are killed before reaching the character, it correctly returns `True`.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine if we can kill all monsters before they reach the character. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
