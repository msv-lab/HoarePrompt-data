You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    2 1 3 2 5
    
    -3 -2 3 4 5
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines if it is possible to shoot all monsters with a given maximum number of bullets per second, without shooting any monster at the same distance from the starting point in the same second. It modifies the list `a` to reflect the remaining health of the monsters after the simulated shooting. The function returns `True` if all monsters can be shot under these conditions, and `False` otherwise.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the health of each monster, x is a list of integers representing the initial positions of each monster such that -n <= x[i] < x[i+1] <= n for all i, and k is an integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired in one second.

    #State: `a` is the list of integers representing the health of each monster from the last iteration, `x` is the list of integers representing the initial positions of each monster from the last iteration, and `k` is the integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired in one second from the last iteration. The variable `t` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from the input. For each test case, it reads the number of monsters `n` and the maximum number of bullets `k` that can be fired in one second. It then reads two lists: `a`, which contains the health of each monster, and `x`, which contains the initial positions of each monster. The function determines if it is possible to defeat all the monsters given the constraints and prints 'YES' if it is possible, otherwise 'NO'.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the logic for killing monsters and ensuring they do not reach the character. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly simulate the sequence of actions where bullets are fired and monsters move closer to the character.

Here are some issues with the current implementation:

1. **Distance Handling**: The variable `distance` is used to track the number of seconds that have passed, but the logic for handling the distance is flawed. The condition `if abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance` is incorrect because it does not properly account for the fact that monsters can move closer each second, and the condition should check if any monster reaches the character (position 0).

2. **Rest Bullets Calculation**: The variable `rest` is used to track the remaining bullets, but the logic does not correctly simulate the sequence of actions. Specifically, the logic for decrementing the health of monsters and moving them closer should be interleaved correctly.

3. **Monster Movement**: The program does not correctly simulate the movement of monsters towards the character. After firing bullets, the program should update the positions of the monsters before checking if any have reached the character.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

```
1
3 2
1 2 3
-1 2 3
```

The current implementation will incorrectly return `False` because it does not correctly simulate the sequence of actions. Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def can_survive(a, x, k):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_indices = sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: abs(x[i]))
    time = 0
    while sorted_indices:
        # Check if any monster reaches the character
        if abs(x[sorted_indices[0]]) <= time:
            return False
        # Fire bullets at the closest monsters
        bullets = k
        i = 0
        while bullets > 0 and i < len(sorted_indices):
            index = sorted_indices[i]
            damage = min(bullets, a[index])
            a[index] -= damage
            bullets -= damage
            if a[index] == 0:
                sorted_indices.pop(i)
            else:
                i += 1
        # Move all monsters closer to the character
        for i in range(len(sorted_indices)):
            x[sorted_indices[i]] += 1 if x[sorted_indices[i]] < 0 else -1
        time += 1
    return True

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print('YES' if can_survive(a, x, k) else 'NO')
```

This corrected version properly interleaves the actions of firing bullets and moving monsters, ensuring that the logic correctly simulates the game scenario.
