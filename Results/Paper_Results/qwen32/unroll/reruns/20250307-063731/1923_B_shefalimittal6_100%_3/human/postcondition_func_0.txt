The function determines if it is possible to shoot all monsters with a given maximum number of bullets per second, without shooting any monster at the same distance from the starting point in the same second. It modifies the list `a` to reflect the remaining health of the monsters after the simulated shooting. The function returns `True` if all monsters can be shot under these conditions, and `False` otherwise.
