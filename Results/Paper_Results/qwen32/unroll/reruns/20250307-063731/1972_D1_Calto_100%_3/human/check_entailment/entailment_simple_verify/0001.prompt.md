You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:

    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
    return cnt



- Annotated Code: 
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_2(n, m)
    print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: a is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of a and b, and b is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of a and b, which is stored in variable a. Since b is 0, the GCD is the initial value of a.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
        
    #State: cnt is the final value after the loop completes all iterations, starting from an initial value of -1.
    return cnt
    #The program returns the final value of `cnt` after the loop completes all iterations, starting from an initial value of -1.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
We need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Code Analysis
The provided code contains two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This is a function to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function attempts to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) for given n and m.

Let's analyze `func_2(n, m)`:
- The variable `cnt` is initialized to -1, which seems incorrect because the count should start from 0.
- The loop iterates over possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`.
- Inside the loop, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
- It then updates `cnt` by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

### Verification
The logic in the code does not correctly implement the problem requirements. Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:

For `n = 2` and `m = 3`, the valid pairs are (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2).

- For `b = 1`, `a` can be 1 or 2 because \(a + 1\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1) = 1\).
- For `b = 2`, `a` can be 2 because \(2 + 2\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\).

The code's logic does not correctly identify these pairs. Instead, it relies on a formula that does not match the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
