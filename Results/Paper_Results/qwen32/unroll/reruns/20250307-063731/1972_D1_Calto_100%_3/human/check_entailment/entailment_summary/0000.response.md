### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the program is correct.

The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The provided code consists of two functions:
- `func_1(a, b)`: This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
- `func_2(n, m)`: This function is supposed to compute the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for the given `n` and `m`.

Let's analyze `func_2(n, m)`:

The core logic of `func_2` is as follows:
- It initializes `cnt` to \(-1\).
- It iterates over each `i` from 1 to `m`.
- For each `i`, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
- It updates `cnt` by adding `math.ceil(x / y)` and checking if `x % y == 0`.

The formula and the logic used in `func_2` do not directly correspond to the problem's requirements. To correctly solve the problem, we need to check each pair \((a, b)\) and see if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The provided `func_2` does not implement this check. Therefore, the implementation of `func_2` is incorrect for the given problem.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the problem's requirements.

**Correctness: False**
