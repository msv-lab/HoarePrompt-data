The function `func_2` takes two positive integer parameters `n` and `m` and returns a computed integer value `cnt` after performing a series of calculations involving a loop. The final value of `cnt` is determined by iterating from 1 to `m`, updating `cnt` based on the values of `n` and the loop variable `i`.
