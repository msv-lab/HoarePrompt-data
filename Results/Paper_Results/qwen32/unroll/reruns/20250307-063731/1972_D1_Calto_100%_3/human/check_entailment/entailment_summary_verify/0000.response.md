### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem description to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions specified in the problem description.

Let's examine `func_2` in more detail:

```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
    return cnt
```

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Initialization of `cnt`**: The variable `cnt` is initialized to `-1`. This is incorrect because we should start counting from `0`.
2. **Logic for Counting Pairs**: The logic inside the loop seems incorrect. The formula used to calculate `x` and `y` and the subsequent counting logic do not seem to correctly implement the problem description's requirements.

#### Correct Logic:
To correctly implement the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

#### Verification:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described above. It incorrectly calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) and starts counting from `-1`.

The function summary provided does not align with the actual logic of `func_2`. The summary states that `func_2` performs a series of calculations involving a loop to update `cnt`, but it does not specify the exact logic used, which is crucial for verifying correctness.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, it is incorrect.

#### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The code incorrectly initializes the count variable and uses an incorrect formula to count valid pairs. The correct approach involves iterating over all pairs and checking the condition directly.
