Reasoning: 

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). However, the function `func_2` does not implement this logic at all. Instead, it performs a calculation involving `n`, `m`, and a loop that does not reflect the conditions stated in the problem.

The function `func_1` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers, but this function is not used in `func_2`.

The logic in `func_2` seems to be attempting to count some kind of pairs based on a different formula, which is unrelated to the problem's requirements. Specifically, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`, then updates `cnt` based on these values, which does not correspond to checking the condition `a + b % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0`.

Therefore, the provided code does not meet the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
