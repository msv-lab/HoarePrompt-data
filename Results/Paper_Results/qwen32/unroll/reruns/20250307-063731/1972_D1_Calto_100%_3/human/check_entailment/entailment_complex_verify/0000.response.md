### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem description to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions specified in the problem description.

#### Detailed Analysis of `func_2`:
```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
    return cnt
```

Let's break down the logic:
- `cnt` is initialized to `-1`. This is problematic because we should start counting from `0`.
- The loop iterates over `i` from `1` to `m`.
- For each `i`, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
- It then updates `cnt` by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

This logic does not directly check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it uses a different formula that does not align with the problem's requirements.

#### Correct Logic:
To correctly implement the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

#### Verification:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described above. It incorrectly calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) and starts counting from `-1`.

#### Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- `func_1` correctly calculates the GCD of two numbers.
- `func_2` has an incorrect logic for counting valid pairs. The annotations state that `cnt` is the final value after the loop completes all iterations, starting from an initial value of `-1`. This is incorrect and does not match the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
