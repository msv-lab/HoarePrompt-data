Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if it is correct.

The goal is to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
- 1 ≤ a ≤ n
- 1 ≤ b ≤ m
- a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

The annotated program includes two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. However, `func_1` is not used in the program, so we can ignore it. The main logic is in `func_2`.

Let's examine `func_2`:
- It initializes `cnt` to -1.
- It iterates over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`.
- For each `b`, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
- It increments `cnt` by `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

The logic in `func_2` does not directly match the problem's requirements. Specifically, the formula used for `x` and `y` is not derived from the problem statement. The problem requires checking whether `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`, but the provided code does not perform this check.

The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs (a, b) and checking the condition `a + b % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0`. The provided code does not do this, and thus, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
