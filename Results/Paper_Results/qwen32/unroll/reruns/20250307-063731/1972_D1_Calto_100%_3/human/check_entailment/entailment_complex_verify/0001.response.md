### Reasoning:
Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and the provided code to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Analysis
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Code Analysis
The provided code contains two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function attempts to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).

Let's analyze `func_2(n, m)`:
- The variable `cnt` is initialized to -1, which is indeed incorrect because the count should start from 0. However, this might just be an off-by-one error and needs further verification.
- The loop iterates over possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
- Inside the loop, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
- It then updates `cnt` by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

#### Verification
The logic in the code does not seem to correctly implement the problem requirements based on the annotations and the original assessment. Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:

For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).

- For \(b = 1\), \(a\) can be 1 or 2 because \(a + 1\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1) = 1\).
- For \(b = 2\), \(a\) can be 2 because \(2 + 2\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\).

The code's logic does not correctly identify these pairs. Instead, it relies on a formula that does not match the problem's requirements.

Let's verify the annotated code step-by-step:
- The function `func_1` correctly computes the GCD.
- The function `func_2` initializes `cnt` to -1, which seems incorrect.
- The loop iterates over possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
- Inside the loop, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
- It then updates `cnt` by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

The formula used in `func_2` does not align with the problem's requirement of checking whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The code seems to be using a different mathematical approach that is not directly related to the problem.

### Conclusion
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in `func_2` does not correctly implement the problem requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Final: **False**
