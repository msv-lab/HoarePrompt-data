Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect based on the problem description. The function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

Let's break down the problem and the program:

1. **Problem Condition**: We need to find pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 <= a <= n`, `1 <= b <= m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program defines `func_1` as a function to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, `a` and `b`, using the Euclidean algorithm. This part is correct.
   - The program defines `func_2` to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for given `n` and `m`. However, the implementation in `func_2` does not correctly address the problem condition.
   - The logic in `func_2` seems to be an incorrect attempt to count valid pairs by iterating over `b` and calculating some values `x` and `y` which do not directly relate to the problem condition.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check if the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` holds. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

# Function to compute gcd
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

# Function to count valid pairs
def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

# Main function to handle multiple test cases
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        m = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version of the program properly iterates over all pairs `(a, b)` and checks the given condition, ensuring that the solution is correct.
