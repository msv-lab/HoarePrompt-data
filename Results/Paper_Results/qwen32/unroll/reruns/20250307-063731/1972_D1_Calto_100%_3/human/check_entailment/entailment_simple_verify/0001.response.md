Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided program code, and the annotations to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Code Analysis
The provided code contains two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This is a function to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function attempts to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).

Let's analyze `func_2(n, m)`:
- The variable `cnt` is initialized to -1, which seems incorrect because the count should start from 0.
- The loop iterates over possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`.
- Inside the loop, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
- It then updates `cnt` by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

### Verification
The logic in the code does not correctly implement the problem requirements. Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:

For `n = 2` and `m = 3`, the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).

- For `b = 1`, `a` can be 1 or 2 because \(a + 1\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1) = 1\).
- For `b = 2`, `a` can be 2 because \(2 + 2\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\).

The code's logic does not correctly identify these pairs. Instead, it relies on a formula that does not match the problem's requirements.

### Annotated Code Analysis
The annotations provide insights into the state of the program at key points:
- `func_1` correctly computes the GCD of two numbers.
- `func_2` initializes `cnt` to -1, which is incorrect.
- The loop iterates over `b` from 1 to `m`, and the calculations for `x` and `y` do not align with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in `func_2` does not properly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. The formula used in the code does not correspond to the conditions specified in the problem.

### Final Evaluation
Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
