Let's carefully re-evaluate the given problem and the provided code to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Code Analysis
The provided code contains two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This is a function to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function attempts to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).

Let's analyze `func_2(n, m)`:
- The variable `cnt` is initialized to -1, which seems incorrect because the count should start from 0.
- The loop iterates over possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
- Inside the loop, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
- It then updates `cnt` by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

### Verification
The logic in the code does not correctly implement the problem requirements. Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:

For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).

- For \(b = 1\), \(a\) can be 1 or 2 because \(a + 1\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1) = 1\).
- For \(b = 2\), \(a\) can be 2 because \(2 + 2\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\).

The code's logic does not correctly identify these pairs. Instead, it relies on a formula that does not match the problem's requirements.

### Function Summary Analysis
The function summary for `func_2` states that it takes two positive integers \(n\) and \(m\) and returns a computed integer value `cnt` after performing a series of calculations involving a loop. However, the summary does not provide enough detail to confirm that the calculations correctly solve the problem.

### Conclusion
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in `func_2` does not accurately count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

### Final Evaluation
Based on the analysis, the original assessment is correct. The program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
