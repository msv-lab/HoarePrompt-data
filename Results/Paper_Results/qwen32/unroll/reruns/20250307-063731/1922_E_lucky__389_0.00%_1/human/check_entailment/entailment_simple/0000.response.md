Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by constructing an array that has exactly X increasing subsequences. The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the integer X. It then aims to find the lengths of increasing subsequences that can be formed to achieve exactly X subsequences. However, the logic in the program is flawed and does not correctly compute the required array.

The main issues are:
1. The program does not correctly compute the lengths of the increasing subsequences needed to achieve exactly X subsequences.
2. The array `ansv` is constructed in a way that does not guarantee the exact number of increasing subsequences as required.
3. The program does not handle the case where it is impossible to construct such an array (which should return -1).

The provided example outputs do not match the logic in the program. For example, for X = 2, the program should output an array with exactly 2 increasing subsequences, which could be simply [0], but the program outputs [0], which has 2 subsequences ([], [0]), but the logic within the program does not correctly ensure this for larger X values.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect as it does not guarantee the correct number of increasing subsequences for all valid inputs X.

Correctness: **False**
