Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly generate an array that has exactly X increasing subsequences for the given X in the range 2 to 10^18. The approach in the program is flawed and does not ensure that the number of increasing subsequences matches the required X for all test cases.

The program attempts to decompose X-1 into a sum of numbers of the form 2^i - 1 and then constructs an array based on these numbers. However, this method does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly X increasing subsequences. The logic for constructing the array from the decomposed values is also incorrect, as it does not properly account for the required number of subsequences.

To solve the problem correctly, one would need to carefully construct an array that ensures the exact number of increasing subsequences, which is a more complex task than what the provided program attempts to do.
