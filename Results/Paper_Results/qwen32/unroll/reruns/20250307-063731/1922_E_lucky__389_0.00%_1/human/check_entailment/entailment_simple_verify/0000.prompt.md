You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the program does not generate an array that has exactly X increasing subsequences. Let's analyze the issues in the code:

1. **Incomplete Handling of X**: The program attempts to decompose X by repeatedly subtracting powers of 2. However, this approach does not guarantee that the final array will have exactly X increasing subsequences. The logic for constructing the array from the decomposed values is flawed and does not ensure the correct number of subsequences.

2. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, when X is a power of 2, the program should generate an array with a specific structure to ensure the number of increasing subsequences matches X. However, the current implementation does not account for these cases accurately.

3. **Output Format**: The program outputs the array in a way that may not match the expected format for certain values of X. The final array generated by the program might not have the correct number of increasing subsequences, leading to incorrect results.

To illustrate the issue, consider the input `X = 5`. The program should generate an array that has exactly 5 increasing subsequences. However, the current implementation might not produce such an array.

Let's consider a simple example:
- For `X = 5`, the correct output could be an array like `[0, 1, 0]` which has the following increasing subsequences: `[0]`, `[1]`, `[0]`, `[0, 1]`, `[1, 0]`.
- The program might output an array that does not meet this requirement.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect for at least some values of X, and thus the correctness is **False**.
