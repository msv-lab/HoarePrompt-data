You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, X is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18.
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    x -= 1
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i)
            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
        
    #State: `t` is unchanged, `X` is unchanged, `subseq_lens` contains the lengths of subsequences, and `mx` is the maximum length of these subsequences.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: `t` is unchanged, `X` is unchanged, `subseq_lens` contains the lengths of subsequences, `mx` is the maximum length of these subsequences, `ansv` is a list starting with integers from 0 to `mx - 1` followed by all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: mx + (n - 1) (where mx is the maximum length of the subsequences in subseq_lens and n is the total number of elements in subseq_lens)
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: `t` is unchanged, `X` is unchanged, `subseq_lens` contains the lengths of subsequences, `mx` is the maximum length of these subsequences, `ansv` is a list starting with integers from 0 to `mx - 1` followed by all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one.
    print()
    #This is printed: (newline character)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. It processes `t` test cases where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For each test case, it takes an integer `X` such that 2 <= X <= 10^18. The function returns the result for each test case based on the value of `X`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
