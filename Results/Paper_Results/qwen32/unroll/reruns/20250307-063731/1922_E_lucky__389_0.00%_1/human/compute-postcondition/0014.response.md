Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads an integer `X` from the input, processes it to determine a sequence of subsequence lengths, and then prints the length of a derived list followed by the elements of this list. The input `X` is modified during the process, but the original value is not preserved. The function does not accept any parameters directly; it operates on input read from standard input.**
