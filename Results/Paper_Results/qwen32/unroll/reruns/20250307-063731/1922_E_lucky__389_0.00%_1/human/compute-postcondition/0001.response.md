Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, X is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is an input integer decreased by 1.**

Natural language: The value of `x` is now one less than its initial value. All other conditions and values remain the same.
