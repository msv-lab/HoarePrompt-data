The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `x` is an input integer decreased by 1. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `x` must not be 0.

Given that `x` is an input integer decreased by 1, the original input integer must have been at least 1. To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `x` is not 0. Therefore, the original input integer should be at least 2, making `x` at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, X is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is an input integer decreased by 1 and `x` must be greater than 0; `subseq_lens` is an empty list; `mx` is 0**
