The code snippet `x = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `x`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer between 2 and 10^18. However, the code snippet provided does not involve `t` or `X` directly, so these variables remain unchanged.

The variable `x` is newly assigned the value of the integer input. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, X is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is an input integer.**
