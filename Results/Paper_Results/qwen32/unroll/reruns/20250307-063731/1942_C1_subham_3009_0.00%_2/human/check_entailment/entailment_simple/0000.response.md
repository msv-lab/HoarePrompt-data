### Reasoning:
The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed given a regular polygon with `n` sides and `x` vertices already chosen by Bessie, with no additional vertices (`y = 0`) that can be chosen.

The key to solving this problem is recognizing that to form a triangle, we need three vertices. Given `x` vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `x - 2`. This is because, with `x` vertices, the maximum number of edges we can add without creating intersections is `x - 3` (forming a spanning tree), and adding one more edge (forming a triangle) will use up two more vertices, leading to a total of `x - 2` triangles.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by reading the input values, processing each test case, and printing `x - 2` for each case. This aligns with the problem's requirements and the provided examples.
