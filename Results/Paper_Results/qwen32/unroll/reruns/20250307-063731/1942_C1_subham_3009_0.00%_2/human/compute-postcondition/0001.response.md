Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 * 10^5), and `y` is 0. The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The program is currently executing the main block, as indicated by `__name__ == '__main__'`.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to an integer input value, while the other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`) and conditions remain unchanged.
