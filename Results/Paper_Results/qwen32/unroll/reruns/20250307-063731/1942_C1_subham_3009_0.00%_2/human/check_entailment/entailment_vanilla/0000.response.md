Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves a regular polygon with `n` sides. Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices, and we are not allowed to choose any more vertices (`y = 0`). We need to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using only the `x` vertices chosen by Bessie.

### Key Observations

1. **Vertices and Triangles**: To form a triangle, we need 3 vertices. If we have `x` vertices, the maximum number of triangles we can form without any restrictions is `floor((x - 2) / 1)`, but we need to ensure that the triangles do not intersect and are non-intersecting.

2. **Non-intersecting Triangles**: In a polygon, if we choose `x` vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles we can form is `x - 2`. This is because each triangle uses up 3 vertices, but one vertex is shared between triangles in a triangulation of a polygon.

3. **Constraints**: Given that `y = 0`, we cannot add any more vertices to the `x` vertices already chosen by Bessie.

### Solution Analysis

The provided code reads the input and for each test case, it calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using the `x` vertices chosen by Bessie. The formula used is `x - 2`, which aligns with the key observation that the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using `x` vertices in a polygon is `x - 2`.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the solution with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1**: `n = 8`, `x = 4`, `y = 0`, vertices = `[1, 6, 2, 5]`
   - Maximum non-intersecting triangles = `4 - 2 = 2`
   
2. **Test Case 2**: `n = 8`, `x = 8`, `y = 0`, vertices = `[1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8]`
   - Maximum non-intersecting triangles = `8 - 2 = 6`
   
3. **Test Case 3**: `n = 4`, `x = 2`, `y = 0`, vertices = `[1, 3]`
   - Maximum non-intersecting triangles = `2 - 2 = 0` (However, since we need at least 3 vertices to form a triangle, the correct answer is `0`, but the formula `x - 2` gives `0` as well, which is correct in this context).

The code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles using the formula `x - 2`.

### Conclusion

The provided code is correct based on the problem description and the constraints given. Therefore, the correctness of the code is:

Correctness: **True**
