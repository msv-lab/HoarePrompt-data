### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by using a given set of vertices in a regular polygon. The function summary indicates that the function always outputs `x - 2` for each test case, where `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen. 

Let's analyze the correctness of this approach:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to form triangles using the chosen vertices such that no diagonals intersect.
   - For a set of `x` vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `x - 2` if those vertices form a convex polygon (which is the case here since the vertices are part of a regular polygon).

2. **Function Behavior**:
   - The function always returns `x - 2` for each test case.
   - This behavior aligns with the theoretical maximum number of triangles that can be formed from `x` vertices in a convex polygon.

3. **Verification with Test Cases**:
   - **First Test Case**: `n = 8`, `x = 4`, `y = 0`, vertices = `[1, 6, 2, 5]`
     - The function outputs `4 - 2 = 2`, which is correct.
   - **Second Test Case**: `n = 8`, `x = 8`, `y = 0`, vertices = `[1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8]`
     - The function outputs `8 - 2 = 6`, which is correct.
   - **Third Test Case**: `n = 4`, `x = 2`, `y = 0`, vertices = `[1, 3]`
     - The function outputs `2 - 2 = 0`, which is correct.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The function correctly computes the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed from the given vertices.
   - The original assessment incorrectly states that the program is not correct for all potential cases, as the function consistently provides the correct output based on the problem's requirements.
