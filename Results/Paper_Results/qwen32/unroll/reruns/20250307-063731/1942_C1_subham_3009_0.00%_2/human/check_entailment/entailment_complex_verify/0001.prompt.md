You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves a regular polygon with `n` sides. Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices, and we are not allowed to choose any more vertices (`y = 0`). We need to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using only the `x` vertices chosen by Bessie.

### Key Observations

1. **Vertices and Triangles**: To form a triangle, we need 3 vertices. If we have `x` vertices, the maximum number of triangles we can form without any restrictions is `floor((x - 2) / 1)`, but we need to ensure that the triangles do not intersect and are non-intersecting.

2. **Non-intersecting Triangles**: In a polygon, if we choose `x` vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles we can form is `x - 2`. This is because each triangle uses up 3 vertices, but one vertex is shared between triangles in a triangulation of a polygon.

3. **Constraints**: Given that `y = 0`, we cannot add any more vertices to the `x` vertices already chosen by Bessie.

### Solution Analysis

The provided code reads the input and for each test case, it calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using the `x` vertices chosen by Bessie. The formula used is `x - 2`, which aligns with the key observation that the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using `x` vertices in a polygon is `x - 2`.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the solution with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1**: `n = 8`, `x = 4`, `y = 0`, vertices = `[1, 6, 2, 5]`
   - Maximum non-intersecting triangles = `4 - 2 = 2`
   
2. **Test Case 2**: `n = 8`, `x = 8`, `y = 0`, vertices = `[1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8]`
   - Maximum non-intersecting triangles = `8 - 2 = 6`
   
3. **Test Case 3**: `n = 4`, `x = 2`, `y = 0`, vertices = `[1, 3]`
   - Maximum non-intersecting triangles = `2 - 2 = 0` (However, since we need at least 3 vertices to form a triangle, the correct answer is `0`, but the formula `x - 2` gives `0` as well, which is correct in this context).

The code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles using the formula `x - 2`.

### Conclusion

The provided code is correct based on the problem description and the constraints given. Therefore, the correctness of the code is:

Correctness: **True**
