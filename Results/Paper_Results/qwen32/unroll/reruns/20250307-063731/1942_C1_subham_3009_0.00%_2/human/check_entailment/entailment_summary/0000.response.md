### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by using a given set of vertices and potentially adding up to `y` more vertices. In this specific version of the problem, `y` is always 0, meaning no additional vertices can be chosen.

For a regular polygon with `n` sides, if `x` vertices are chosen, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using these `x` vertices is `x - 2`. This is because any set of `x` vertices can form at most `x - 2` triangles without any intersections, following the properties of triangulating a polygon.

The provided program correctly calculates and outputs `x - 2` for each test case, which aligns with the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct for the given constraints and problem description.

### Correctness: **True**
