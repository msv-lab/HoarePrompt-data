### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using `x` vertices chosen from a regular polygon with `n` sides, where `y = 0` (no additional vertices can be chosen).

The key observation is that, for a set of `x` vertices in a polygon, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `x - 2`. This is because each triangle uses 3 vertices, and in a triangulation of a polygon, one vertex is shared between triangles.

The provided code correctly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles using the formula `x - 2` for each test case. Let's verify this with the examples given:

1. **Test Case 1**: `n = 8`, `x = 4`, `y = 0`, vertices = `[1, 6, 2, 5]`
   - Maximum non-intersecting triangles = `4 - 2 = 2`
   - The output is `2`, which is correct.

2. **Test Case 2**: `n = 8`, `x = 8`, `y = 0`, vertices = `[1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8]`
   - Maximum non-intersecting triangles = `8 - 2 = 6`
   - The output is `6`, which is correct.

3. **Test Case 3**: `n = 4`, `x = 2`, `y = 0`, vertices = `[1, 3]`
   - Maximum non-intersecting triangles = `2 - 2 = 0`
   - The output is `0`, which is correct.

The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function, which is to output `x - 2` for each test case. The original assessment is correct as the code aligns with the problem's requirements and constraints.

### Conclusion:

The provided code is correct based on the problem description and the constraints given. Therefore, the correctness of the code is:

Final: **True**
