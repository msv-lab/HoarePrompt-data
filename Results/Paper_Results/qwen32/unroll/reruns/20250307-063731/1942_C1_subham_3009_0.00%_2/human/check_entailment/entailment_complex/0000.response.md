### Reasoning:
The program is designed to solve a problem where the goal is to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed from a regular polygon with `n` sides, given `x` vertices that can be used to form diagonals and `y = 0` (indicating no additional vertices can be chosen).

The key insight is that with `x` vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `x - 2`. This is because each additional vertex beyond the first two can form a new triangle with two previously chosen vertices, effectively creating `x - 2` triangles.

The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` (where `y` is always 0). It then reads the list of `x` vertices and calculates the number of triangles as `x - 2`.

The program outputs `x - 2` for each test case, which aligns with the problem's requirement to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

### Correctness:
Given the problem description and the provided program, the logic of outputting `x - 2` for each test case is correct. The program correctly handles the input constraints and produces the expected output for the given examples.

**Correctness: True**
