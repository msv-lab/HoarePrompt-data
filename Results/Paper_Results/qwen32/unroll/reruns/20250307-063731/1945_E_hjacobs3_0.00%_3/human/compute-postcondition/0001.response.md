Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that needs to be found in the permutation, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`.**

In this output state, the variables `l` and `r` have been assigned specific values: `l` is set to 0 and `r` is set to `n - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
