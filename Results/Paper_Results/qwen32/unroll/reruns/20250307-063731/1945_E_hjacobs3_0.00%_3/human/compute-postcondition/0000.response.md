The code snippet provided calculates the length of the `array` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, and `find` is an integer that needs to be found in the permutation. The execution of the code does not affect `array` or `find` directly, but it does assign a new value to `n`.

Given the initial state, the only change is the assignment of `n` to the length of `array`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that needs to be found in the permutation, `n` is the length of `array`.**
