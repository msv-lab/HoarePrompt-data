You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    if res:
        print(' '.join(res))
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (0, n - 1)
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] >= find:
            r = mid - 1
        else:
            l = mid + 1
    if l != array.index(find):
        print(1)
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
    else:
        print(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list `array` representing a permutation of distinct integers from 1 to n, and an integer `find`. It returns a list containing two strings: the first is the 1-based index of the first element in `array` that is greater than or equal to `find`, and the second is the 1-based index of the first occurrence of `find` in `array`. If no such element exists, the behavior is not explicitly defined in the provided code or annotations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code does not guarantee that after performing at most two swaps, the binary search will correctly identify the position of `x` in the permutation `p` such that `p_l` is equal to `x`. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Incorrect Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search loop condition is `while l <= r`, which is correct. However, the logic inside the loop is flawed. The condition `if array[mid] >= find` should be `if array[mid] < find` to correctly move the `l` and `r` pointers.
   - The code also incorrectly handles the case where `l` does not match the index of `find` in the array. It only performs one swap, which may not be sufficient in all cases.

2. **Insufficient Swaps**:
   - The problem states that at most two swaps can be performed. The current implementation only performs one swap if necessary, which is not always sufficient to make the binary search work correctly.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return a list of strings representing the swaps, but it currently prints the number of swaps instead of returning it. This is inconsistent with the expected output format.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where `x` is already in the correct position after the binary search, or where multiple swaps are needed.

To illustrate the issues, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
2 4
1 5
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
1 3
```

In this case, the code performs only one swap, which does not result in the binary search correctly identifying the position of `x`. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
