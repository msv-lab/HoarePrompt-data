Reasoning:

The given annotated program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The program's goal is to rearrange the permutation such that after performing at most 2 swaps, a binary search will correctly identify the index of the target number `x`. However, the provided `func_1` function does not perform any rearrangement of the array. Instead, it attempts to find the index of `x` and potentially swap it with another element, but this approach does not guarantee that a binary search will correctly find `x` after the operation.

Here are the key issues:
1. **No Rearrangement**: The program does not rearrange the array to make it suitable for binary search. It only prints the indices that would be swapped, but these swaps do not necessarily make the array sorted or help the binary search find the correct index.
2. **Binary Search Assumption**: The binary search algorithm assumes that the array is sorted. The provided function does not sort the array or ensure that the array is in a state where binary search can correctly find the target `x`.
3. **Incorrect Output**: The function prints the number of operations and the indices to swap, but it does not actually perform the swaps on the array. This means that the binary search that follows (which is not shown in the provided code) will not see the swapped array.

The correct approach would involve rearranging the array such that a binary search can find the target `x` after at most 2 swaps. This would typically involve placing `x` at a position where it can be found by binary search, possibly by placing it in the middle of the array or ensuring that it is in a position that can be reached by binary search after at most 2 swaps.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
