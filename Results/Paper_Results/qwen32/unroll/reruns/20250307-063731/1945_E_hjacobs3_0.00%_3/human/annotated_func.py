#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to n, and find is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n) that needs to be found in the permutation.
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] >= find:
            r = mid - 1
        else:
            l = mid + 1
        
    #State: `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l] >= find`, `r` is `l - 1`.
    if (l != array.index(find)) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
        #The program returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the 1-based index of the first element in `array` that is greater than or equal to `find`, and the second string is the 1-based index of the first occurrence of `find` in `array`.
    else :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l] >= find`, `r` is `l - 1`, and `l` is equal to `array.index(find)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `array` representing a permutation of distinct integers from 1 to n, and an integer `find`. It returns a list containing two strings: the first is the 1-based index of the first element in `array` that is greater than or equal to `find`, and the second is the 1-based index of the first occurrence of `find` in `array`. If no such element exists, the behavior is not explicitly defined in the provided code or annotations.
