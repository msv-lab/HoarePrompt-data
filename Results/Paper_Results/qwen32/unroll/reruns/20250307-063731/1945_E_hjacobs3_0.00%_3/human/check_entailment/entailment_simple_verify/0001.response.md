### Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The provided binary search in the code does not terminate when `array[mid] == x`. Instead, it continues until `l > r`, which means `l` will be the smallest index such that `array[l] >= x`. This is not incorrect per se, but it doesn't directly align with the typical binary search to find the exact position of `x`. However, the core issue is not the search itself but the logic that follows it.

2. **Logic to Perform Swaps**:
   - The code checks if `l` is not equal to the index of `x` in the array. If they are not equal, it performs a single swap to bring `x` to the position `l`.
   - This logic is flawed because it assumes that a single swap can always bring `x` to the correct position, which is not guaranteed. The problem statement specifies that up to two swaps are allowed, but the code only handles one swap.

3. **Handling of Two Swaps**:
   - The code does not handle the case where two swaps are required to bring `x` to the correct position after the binary search. This is a critical flaw as the problem guarantees that two swaps are always sufficient, but the code does not account for this.

4. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program and the logic of the binary search and the subsequent swap. They highlight that `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l] >= x` after the binary search loop.
   - The annotations also correctly describe the logic for performing a single swap if `l` is not equal to the index of `x`.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as it does not handle the case where two swaps are required. The logic for performing swaps is too simplistic and does not guarantee that `p_l` will be equal to `x` after the binary search.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
