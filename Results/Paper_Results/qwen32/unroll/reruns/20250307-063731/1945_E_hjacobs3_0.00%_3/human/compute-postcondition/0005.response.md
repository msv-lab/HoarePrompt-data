In the given task, the `print` statement is:

```python
print(1)
```

The initial state provides information about the variables `l` and `r`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the integer `1`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
- The initial state describes the values and conditions of variables `l` and `r`, but these do not influence the output of the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement directly outputs the integer `1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **1**
