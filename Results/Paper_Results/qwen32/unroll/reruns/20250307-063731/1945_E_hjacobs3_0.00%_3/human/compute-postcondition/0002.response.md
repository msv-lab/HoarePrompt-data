To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop, we need to ensure that the condition `l <= r` is satisfied. 

Given:
- `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
- `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that needs to be found in the permutation.
- `n` is the length of `array`.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 1`.

The `while` loop condition is `l <= r`. 

Right before the loop, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`. For `l <= r` to be true, `n` must be at least 1 because if `n` were 0, `r` would be -1, and the condition `0 <= -1` would be false. Since `n` is given to be at least 1, the initial values of `l` and `r` already satisfy the condition `l <= r`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states of `l` and `r` for the loop to execute the first time. The state right before the loop already allows the loop to proceed.

State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that needs to be found in the permutation, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`**
