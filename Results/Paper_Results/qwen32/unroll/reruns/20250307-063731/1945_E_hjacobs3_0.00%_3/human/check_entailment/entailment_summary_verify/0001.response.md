### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem requirements and the function summary.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Permutation Array**: We have a permutation array `p` of size `n` and a target number `x` to find.
2. **Binary Search**: We need to perform binary search on this array, but it is not sorted.
3. **Swaps**: We can perform at most 2 swaps to ensure that after the binary search, the element at position `l` is equal to `x`.
4. **Binary Search Details**: The binary search algorithm should correctly identify the position `l` where `x` should be.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code does not correctly implement the binary search as per the problem requirements. Here are the issues identified:

1. **Incorrect Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search loop continues until `l > r`, which is correct, but it does not handle the case where `array[mid] == x` properly.
   - The loop should terminate when `array[mid] == x` and set `l` or `r` to `mid` accordingly.

2. **Single Swap Logic**:
   - The code attempts to swap the element at `l` with the first occurrence of `x` in the array. However, this does not guarantee that after the binary search, `p_l` will be equal to `x`.
   - The code does not consider the possibility of performing two swaps to achieve the desired result.

3. **Handling of Two Swaps**:
   - The code only handles the case of one swap, which is insufficient for all scenarios. The problem guarantees that two swaps are always sufficient, but the code does not implement this logic.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
The function summary states that `func_1` returns a list containing two strings representing the 1-based indices of the elements to be swapped. However, the function does not handle the two-swap requirement correctly and does not ensure that `p_l` will be equal to `x` after the binary search.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the code does not correctly implement the required functionality. It fails to correctly perform the binary search and does not handle the two-swap requirement properly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
