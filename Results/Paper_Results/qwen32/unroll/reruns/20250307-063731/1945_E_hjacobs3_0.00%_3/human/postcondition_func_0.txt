The function accepts a list `array` representing a permutation of distinct integers from 1 to n, and an integer `find`. It returns a list containing two strings: the first is the 1-based index of the first element in `array` that is greater than or equal to `find`, and the second is the 1-based index of the first occurrence of `find` in `array`. If no such element exists, the behavior is not explicitly defined in the provided code or annotations.
