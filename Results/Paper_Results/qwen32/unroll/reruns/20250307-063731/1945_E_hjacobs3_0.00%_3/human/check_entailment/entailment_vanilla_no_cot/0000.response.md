Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search implementation in `func_1` does not correctly handle the problem's requirements. The binary search should be modified to ensure that after performing up to 2 swaps, the element `x` ends up at the position `l` after the search completes.

2. **Handling of Swaps**: The program only attempts to perform a single swap if the binary search does not place `x` at the correct position (`l`). However, the problem guarantees that up to 2 swaps are sufficient to achieve the desired result, and the program does not take advantage of this.

3. **Output Format**: The output format is incorrect. The program should output the number of swaps followed by the swaps themselves in the required format.

4. **Logic for Swaps**: The logic for determining when and how to perform the swaps is incorrect. The program does not consider the possibility of performing two swaps to achieve the desired result.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def find_swaps(array, x):
    n = len(array)
    target_index = array.index(x)
    (l, r) = (0, n - 1)
    
    swaps = []
    
    # Perform binary search
    while l < r:
        mid = (l + r + 1) // 2
        if array[mid] <= x:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid - 1
    
    if array[l] != x:
        # If the element is not at the correct position, swap it into place
        swaps.append((l, target_index))
        array[l], array[target_index] = array[target_index], array[l]
        target_index = l
    
    # Perform binary search again to ensure correctness
    (l, r) = (0, n - 1)
    while l < r:
        mid = (l + r + 1) // 2
        if array[mid] <= x:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid - 1
    
    if array[l] != x:
        # If the element is still not at the correct position, swap it into place
        swaps.append((l, target_index))
        array[l], array[target_index] = array[target_index], array[l]
    
    return swaps

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    swaps = find_swaps(array, x)
    print(len(swaps))
    for swap in swaps:
        print(swap[0] + 1, swap[1] + 1)
    t -= 1
```

This corrected version ensures that up to 2 swaps are performed if necessary to place `x` at the correct position after the binary search.
