Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `l` is defined as the smallest index such that `array[l] >= find`.
2. `r` is defined as `l - 1`.
3. `l` is also defined as `array.index(find)`.

### Key Points:
- The variable `l` is defined twice in the initial state. This could be a contradiction unless `array.index(find)` returns the smallest index such that `array[l] >= find`. This implies that `find` is present in the `array` and `array.index(find)` returns the first occurrence of `find`, which also satisfies `array[l] >= find`.
- The variable `r` is defined as `l - 1`, but it is not used in the provided code snippet.
- The `print` statement is `print(0)`, which means it will print the integer `0` regardless of the values of `l` and `r`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(0)
```

### Explanation:
The `print(0)` statement will output the integer `0` because the value to be printed is explicitly `0` and does not depend on any variables or conditions defined in the initial state.

### Final Output:
Output: **0**
