Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code does not guarantee that after performing at most two swaps, the binary search will correctly identify the position of `x` in the permutation `p` such that `p_l` is equal to `x`. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Incorrect Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search loop condition is `while l <= r`, which is correct. However, the logic inside the loop is flawed. The condition `if array[mid] >= find` should be `if array[mid] < find` to correctly move the `l` and `r` pointers.
   - The code also incorrectly handles the case where `l` does not match the index of `find` in the array. It only performs one swap, which may not be sufficient in all cases.

2. **Insufficient Swaps**:
   - The problem states that at most two swaps can be performed. The current implementation only performs one swap if necessary, which is not always sufficient to make the binary search work correctly.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return a list of strings representing the swaps, but it currently prints the number of swaps instead of returning it. This is inconsistent with the expected output format.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where `x` is already in the correct position after the binary search, or where multiple swaps are needed.

To illustrate the issues, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
2 4
1 5
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
1 3
```

In this case, the code performs only one swap, which does not result in the binary search correctly identifying the position of `x`. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
