Given the initial state:
- `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l] >= find`
- `r` is `l - 1`
- `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in the array

The code to be executed is:
```python
return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
```

Let's break down the output:
- `str(l + 1)`: Since `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l] >= find`, `l + 1` will be the position (1-based index) of the first element in `array` that is greater than or equal to `find`.
- `str(array.index(find) + 1)`: This will be the position (1-based index) of the first occurrence of `find` in `array`.

Since `l` is not equal to the index of `find`, `l + 1` and `array.index(find) + 1` will be different values.

Output State: **The program returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the 1-based index of the first element in `array` that is greater than or equal to `find`, and the second string is the 1-based index of the first occurrence of `find` in `array`.**
