Postcondition: **`k` is an integer that serves as an index, and `primes` and `factors` are lists or dictionaries used within the function. If `k` is equal to the length of `primes`, `1` has been yielded. Otherwise, `k` is a valid index within the bounds of the `primes` list, `rest` is assigned the value returned by `generate(k + 1)`, and `prime` is assigned the value of `primes[k]`.**
