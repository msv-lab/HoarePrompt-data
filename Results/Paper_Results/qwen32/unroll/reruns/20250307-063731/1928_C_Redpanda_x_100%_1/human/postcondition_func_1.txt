The function `generate` takes an integer `k` as input and uses it to index into the `primes` and `factors` lists or dictionaries to generate and yield a sequence of numbers. The sequence is generated recursively by multiplying the factors of the prime at index `k` with the numbers generated by the recursive call for `k + 1`. If `k` is equal to the length of `primes`, it yields `1`.
