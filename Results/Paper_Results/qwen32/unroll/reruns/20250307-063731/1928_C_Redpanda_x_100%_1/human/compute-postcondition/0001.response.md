Output State: **`k` is an integer that serves as an index, `primes` and `factors` are lists or dictionaries. The relationship is that `k` is used to index into `primes` and `factors`. The current value of `k` is equal to the length of `primes`. `1` has been yielded.**

In this output state, the value of `k` remains unchanged, and it still represents an index used with the `primes` and `factors` data structures. The relationship between `k` and the length of `primes` is preserved. The code has yielded the value `1`, which means that `1` is output as part of a generator function's sequence.
