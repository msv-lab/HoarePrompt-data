Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is an integer that serves as an index, `primes` and `factors` are lists or dictionaries used within the function, `k` is not equal to the length of `primes`, meaning `k` is a valid index within the bounds of the `primes` list; `rest` is assigned the value returned by `generate(k + 1)`, `prime` is assigned the value of `primes[k]`.
Code of the loop:
for factor in rest:
    prime_to_i = 1
    for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
        yield factor * prime_to_i
        prime_to_i *= prime


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
