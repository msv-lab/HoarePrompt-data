Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

    ans2 = set()

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function signature does not match the problem description or the provided examples. The function `generate` does not take variables `n` and `x` as described in the problem. However, based on the given signature, `k` is an integer that serves as an index, and `primes` and `factors` are lists or dictionaries that are used within the function. The relationship is that `k` is used to index into `primes` and `factors` to generate some sequence of numbers.
def generate(k):
    if (k == len(primes)) :
        yield 1
    else :
        rest = generate(k + 1)
        prime = primes[k]
        for factor in rest:
            prime_to_i = 1
            
            for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
                yield factor * prime_to_i
                prime_to_i *= prime
            
        #State: `k` is an integer index, `primes` and `factors` are lists or dictionaries used within the function, `k` is not equal to the length of `primes`, meaning `k` is a valid index within the bounds of the `primes` list; `rest` is assigned the value returned by `generate(k + 1)`, `prime` is assigned the value of `primes[k]`.
    #State: `k` is an integer that serves as an index, and `primes` and `factors` are lists or dictionaries used within the function. If `k` is equal to the length of `primes`, `1` has been yielded. Otherwise, `k` is a valid index within the bounds of the `primes` list, `rest` is assigned the value returned by `generate(k + 1)`, and `prime` is assigned the value of `primes[k]`.
