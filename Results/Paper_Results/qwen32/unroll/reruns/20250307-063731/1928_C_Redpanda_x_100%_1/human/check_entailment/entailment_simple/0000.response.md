### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve the problem of finding the number of different values of \( k \) that fit the given constraints based on Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received during the settling \( x \). Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the required logic.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) (Vasya's position) and \( x \) (the number Vasya received).

2. **Logic for Finding Valid \( k \):**
   - The program initializes a set `ans` to store valid \( k \) values.
   - It calculates two possible values for \( h \):
     - \( h = n - x \)
     - \( h = n + x - 2 \) if \( x \neq 1 \)
   - It then uses a function `func_1(h)` to generate all divisors of \( h \) that are even and satisfy \( k/2 + 1 \geq x \).
   - The results from both calculations of \( h \) are combined into a single set `ans` to avoid duplicates.
   - Finally, the program prints the size of the set `ans`, which represents the number of valid \( k \) values.

3. **Function `func_1(n)`:**
   - This function calculates the prime factorization of \( n \).
   - It uses a helper function `generate(k)` to recursively generate all divisors of \( n \).
   - The divisors generated are filtered to include only those that are even and satisfy \( k/2 + 1 \geq x \).

4. **Function `generate(k)`:**
   - This recursive function generates all possible combinations of the prime factors of \( n \) to form divisors.
   - It yields each valid divisor.

### Analysis:

- **Prime Factorization and Divisor Generation:**
  - The prime factorization and divisor generation logic appears correct. The function `func_1` computes all divisors of \( h \) by generating combinations of its prime factors.

- **Filtering Divisors:**
  - The program filters the divisors to include only those that are even and satisfy \( k/2 + 1 \geq x \). This is consistent with the problem's requirement to find valid \( k \) values.

- **Combining Results:**
  - The program combines results from both calculations of \( h \) to ensure all possible valid \( k \) values are considered.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where \( x = 1 \) by not calculating \( h = n + x - 2 \).
  - The program ensures that only \( k > 1 \) is considered, as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of different \( k \) values that fit the given constraints. It correctly parses the input, generates all valid divisors, filters them based on the problem's requirements, and combines results to produce the final answer.

**Correctness: True**
