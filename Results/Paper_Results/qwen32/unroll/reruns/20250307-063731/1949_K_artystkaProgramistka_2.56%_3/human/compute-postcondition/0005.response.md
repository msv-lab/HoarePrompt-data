Postcondition: **`group_a` contains the first, fourth, seventh, ..., numbers from `numbers`; `group_b` contains the second, fifth, eighth, ..., numbers; `group_c` contains the third, sixth, ninth, ..., numbers; `sum_a` is the sum of the numbers in `group_a`; `sum_b` is the sum of the numbers in `group_b`; `sum_c` is the sum of the numbers in `group_c`. The condition `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` is true.**
