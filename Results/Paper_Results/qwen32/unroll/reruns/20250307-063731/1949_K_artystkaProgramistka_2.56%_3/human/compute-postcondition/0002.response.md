The code snippet initializes three variables `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, `numbers`, `group_a`, `group_b`, or `group_c`. The only change is the introduction of `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` with the value 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 200,000, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9, sorted in descending order; `group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c` are empty lists; `sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0.**
