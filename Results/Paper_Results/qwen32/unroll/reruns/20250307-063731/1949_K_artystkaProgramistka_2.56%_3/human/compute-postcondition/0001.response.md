Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 200,000, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9, sorted in descending order; `group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c` are empty lists.**

The initial state specifies the constraints and values of `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. The code snippet initializes three empty lists: `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. These lists are newly introduced and set to be empty, while all other variables retain their initial values and constraints.
