Output State: **The program returns 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c. Here, group_a contains the first, fourth, seventh, ..., numbers from the original list 'numbers'; group_b contains the second, fifth, eighth, ..., numbers; and group_c contains the third, sixth, ninth, ..., numbers. The condition `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` is true, where `sum_a` is the sum of the numbers in `group_a`, `sum_b` is the sum of the numbers in `group_b`, and `sum_c` is the sum of the numbers in `group_c`.**
