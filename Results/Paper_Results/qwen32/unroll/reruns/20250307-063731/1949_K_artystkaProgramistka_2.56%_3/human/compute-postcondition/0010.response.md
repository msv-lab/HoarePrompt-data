Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), three positive integers `na`, `nb`, and `nc` such that their sum equals `n`, and a list `numbers` of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9. It sorts the list in descending order and distributes the numbers into three groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c`) based on their positions (1st, 4th, 7th, ...; 2nd, 5th, 8th, ...; 3rd, 6th, 9th, ... respectively). It then calculates the sums of these groups. If the condition `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` is true, it returns 'YES' along with the three groups. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.**
