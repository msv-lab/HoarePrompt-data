Functionality: **The function accepts five parameters: `n` (an integer between 3 and 200,000), `na`, `nb`, `nc` (positive integers such that their sum equals `n`), and `numbers` (a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9). The function returns 'YES' along with three groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c`) if the condition `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` is true, where `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are the sums of the numbers in `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` respectively. `group_a` contains the first, fourth, seventh, ..., numbers from `numbers`; `group_b` contains the second, fifth, eighth, ..., numbers; and `group_c` contains the third, sixth, ninth, ..., numbers. If the condition is not met, the function returns 'NO'.**
