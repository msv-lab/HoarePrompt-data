Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5), an integer `t` which is always 1, a list of `n-1` pairs of integers (u, v) representing the edges of the tree, and a single integer `u_1` representing the starting node of a stone (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n). The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves. The function returns the number of moves required to move the stone from the starting node to the farthest leaf node in the tree.**
