Functionality: **The function determines the winner ('Hermione' or 'Ron') of a game played on a tree structure. The game involves moving a stone from a starting node to a farthest leaf node, and the winner is decided based on the parity of the number of moves required to reach the farthest leaf. The function accepts the number of nodes `n` in the tree, a list of `n-1` edges representing the tree, and a starting node `u_1`. It prints 'Hermione' if the number of moves is odd, otherwise it prints 'Ron'.**
