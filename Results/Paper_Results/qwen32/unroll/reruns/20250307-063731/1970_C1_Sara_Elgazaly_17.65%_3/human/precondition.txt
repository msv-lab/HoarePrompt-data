n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, t is an integer with t=1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing the edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n.
