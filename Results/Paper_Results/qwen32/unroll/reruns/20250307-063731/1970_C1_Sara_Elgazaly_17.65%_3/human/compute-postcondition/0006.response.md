To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's analyze the loop step by step.

The loop in question is:

```python
while lst[x] != []:
    while lst[x]:
        y = lst[x].pop()
        if lst[y] != []:
            x = y
            break
    s = not s
```

### Initial State:
- `lst` is an adjacency list representing the first `x - 1` edges of a tree.
- `n`, `t`, `u_1`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
- `s` is `True`.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Outer Loop (`while lst[x] != []`)**: This loop continues as long as there are elements in the list `lst[x]`. This means the loop will run as long as there are children of node `x` in the adjacency list.

2. **Inner Loop (`while lst[x]`)**: This loop continues as long as `lst[x]` is not empty. Inside this loop, the last element of `lst[x]` is popped and assigned to `y`.

3. **Condition (`if lst[y] != []`)**: If the node `y` has children (i.e., `lst[y]` is not empty), then `x` is updated to `y`, and the inner loop is broken, meaning we move to the next iteration of the outer loop.

4. **Toggle `s` (`s = not s`)**: After the inner loop finishes (either by breaking or exhausting the list), `s` is toggled (i.e., if `s` was `True`, it becomes `False`, and vice versa).

### Outcome:
- The loop will traverse the tree starting from node `x`, moving to child nodes that have children themselves.
- The loop will continue until all children of the current node `x` have been processed and no more children are found.
- The variable `s` will be toggled each time the inner loop completes, meaning it will alternate between `True` and `False` with each iteration of the outer loop.

### Final Output State:
- The loop terminates when `lst[x]` is empty, meaning all children of the current node `x` have been processed.
- The variable `s` will be in its final toggled state.
- The adjacency list `lst` will have some of its lists emptied as nodes are processed.
- The variable `x` will be the last node processed, which will have an empty list in `lst`.

### Conclusion:
The output state will be the final state of `lst`, `x`, and `s` after all iterations of the loop.

Output State: **`lst` with some lists emptied, `x` being the last node processed with an empty list in `lst`, `s` toggled to its final state.**
