n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, t is an integer where t=1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing the edges of the tree (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n), and the last line contains t integers (u_1) representing the starting node of the stone (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n). The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.
