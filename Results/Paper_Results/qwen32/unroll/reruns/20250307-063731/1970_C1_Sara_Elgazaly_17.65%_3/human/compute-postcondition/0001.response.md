The provided code snippet initializes a `defaultdict` named `lst`. This dictionary will be used to store the adjacency list representation of the tree. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer where t=1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing the edges of the tree (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n), and the last line contains t integers (u_1) representing the starting node of the stone (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n). The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves; `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input. `lst` is a defaultdict of lists.**
