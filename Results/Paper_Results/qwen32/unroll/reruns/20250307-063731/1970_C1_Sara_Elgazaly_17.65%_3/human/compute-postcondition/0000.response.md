The provided code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into two integers, which are then assigned to the variables `x` and `y`. This operation does not affect any of the variables mentioned in the initial state except for `x` and `y`.

Given the initial state, the variables `n`, `t`, the edges of the tree, and the starting node of the stone remain unchanged. The only changes are the assignments to `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer where t=1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing the edges of the tree (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n), and the last line contains t integers (u_1) representing the starting node of the stone (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n). The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves; `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input.**
