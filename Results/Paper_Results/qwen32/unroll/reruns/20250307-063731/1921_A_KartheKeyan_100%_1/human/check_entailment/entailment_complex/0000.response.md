### Reasoning:

The task is to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads four lines of input, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of a corner of the square. These coordinates are stored in a list `coord`.

2. **Sorting Coordinates:**
   - The coordinates are sorted. Sorting helps in easily identifying the adjacent corners of the square.

3. **Calculating Side Lengths:**
   - The program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of adjacent corners: `p1` and `p2`.
   - `p1` is the squared distance between the first two sorted coordinates (`coord[0]` and `coord[1]`).
   - `p2` is the squared distance between the last two sorted coordinates (`coord[2]` and `coord[3]`).

4. **Calculating Area:**
   - The side length of the square is the square root of `p1` (or `p2`, since all sides of a square are equal).
   - The area of the square is then the square of the side length, which is `math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)`.
   - The result is rounded and printed.

### Issues and Corrections:
- **Incorrect Calculation of Area:** The area of the square should be the square of the side length, which is `math.sqrt(p1) ** 2` (or `math.sqrt(p2) ** 2`). The provided code incorrectly multiplies the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, which is not correct.
- **Simplification:** Since `p1` and `p2` are squared distances of the same side length, one of them can be used directly to calculate the area.

### Corrected Calculation:
- The corrected area calculation should be `res = math.sqrt(p1) ** 2` or simply `res = p1` (since `p1` is already the squared side length).

### Corrected Code:
```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        
        coord = sorted(coord)
        
        p1 = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2
        
        res = p1
        
        print(res)
        
        n -= 1

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the incorrect calculation of the area. The corrected program should use the squared distance of one side directly as the area.

**Correctness: False**
