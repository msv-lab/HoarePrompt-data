Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the area of the square. The logic for calculating the side length and subsequently the area is flawed. Here's a detailed explanation:

The program attempts to compute the side length of the square by calculating the distance between two adjacent points and then multiplying them, which is incorrect. The correct approach is to compute the distance between any two adjacent points (which will be the side length of the square) and then square that distance to get the area.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        # Since the sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, we can find the side length
        # by finding the maximum difference in x-coordinates or y-coordinates.
        x_coords = [x for x, y in coord]
        y_coords = [y for x, y in coord]
        side_length = max(max(x_coords) - min(x_coords), max(y_coords) - min(y_coords))
        area = side_length ** 2
        print(area)
        n -= 1

func()
```

In this corrected version, we find the side length of the square by determining the maximum difference between the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of the corners. The side length is the larger of these two differences, and the area is the square of the side length.
