### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners. The approach taken by the program is as follows:

1. It reads the number of test cases `n`.
2. For each test case, it reads four lines of coordinates representing the corners of the square.
3. It stores these coordinates in a list `coord`.
4. It sorts the list of coordinates. Sorting the coordinates helps in easily identifying the side lengths of the square.
5. It calculates the squared distances between two pairs of adjacent corners (which should be equal for a square) using the distance formula: \((x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2\).
6. It computes the area of the square by multiplying the square roots of these squared distances and then rounding the result to get the area.

However, there is a flaw in the logic:
- The program calculates the product of the lengths of two sides (`p1` and `p2`). For a square, these lengths should be equal, and the area should be the square of one of these lengths, not their product.
- The correct approach would be to calculate the squared distance between any two adjacent corners and then take the square root of this distance to get the side length of the square. The area would then be the square of this side length.

Given the provided example, the program's output is incorrect:
- For the first test case, the correct area is 9, but the program might output a different value due to the incorrect calculation method.
- For the second test case, the correct area is 4, but the program might output a different value.
- For the third test case, the correct area is 784, but the program might output a different value.
