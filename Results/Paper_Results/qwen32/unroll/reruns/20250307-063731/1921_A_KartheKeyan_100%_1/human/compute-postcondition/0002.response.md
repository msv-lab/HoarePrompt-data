In the given `while` loop, the condition is `while n:`. In Python, a non-zero integer is considered `True` in a boolean context, and zero is considered `False`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `n` is any non-zero integer.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `n` is an input integer
- `l` is the last read integer
- `s` is the last calculated value
- `x_i` and `y_i` are unchanged

The only variable in the loop head is `n`. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be a non-zero integer. The values of `l`, `s`, `x_i`, and `y_i` do not affect the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a non-zero integer, `l` is the last read integer, `s` is the last calculated value, `x_i` and `y_i` are unchanged**
