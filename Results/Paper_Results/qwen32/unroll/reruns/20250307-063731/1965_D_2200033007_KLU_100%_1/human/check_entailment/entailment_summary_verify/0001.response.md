### Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its functions to determine if they correctly solve the problem as described.

### Function Analysis:

1. **Function 1: `func_1(a)`**
   - **Purpose:** Generates all possible subarray sums of the array `a` and returns them in a sorted list.
   - **Analysis:** This function correctly generates all subarray sums. However, since the array `a` is unknown, this function is not directly used in the main logic. Instead, it seems to be a utility function that could be used to verify the correctness of the generated palindrome.

2. **Function 2: `func_2(cts)`**
   - **Purpose:** Takes a list of subarray sums `cts` and returns a list of sums that appear an odd number of times.
   - **Analysis:** This function correctly identifies sums that appear an odd number of times. In the context of the problem, the missing subarray sum will appear an odd number of times, while all other sums will appear an even number of times due to the symmetry of the palindrome.

3. **Function 3: `func_3(odds, n)`**
   - **Purpose:** Reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the list of sums that appear an odd number of times (`odds`).
   - **Analysis:** This function attempts to reconstruct the palindrome by assigning values based on the differences between consecutive sums in `odds`. However, there is a critical issue here:
     - The reconstruction logic assumes that the difference between consecutive sums in `odds` corresponds to the elements in the palindrome array. This assumption is flawed because the differences do not directly translate to the elements of the palindrome.
     - For example, consider the sums `[2, 4]` derived from a palindrome `[1, 2, 1]`. The difference `4 - 2 = 2` does not directly give the middle element `2` of the palindrome.
     - A more accurate approach would involve more sophisticated handling of the sums to deduce the elements of the palindrome.

4. **Function 4: `func_4(bigList, smallList)`**
   - **Purpose:** Compares the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` and removes them if they are equal. It returns the last element of `bigList` after all possible removals.
   - **Analysis:** This function is not directly used in the main logic of the program to solve the problem. It seems to be an auxiliary function that could be used in a different context but is not necessary for the current problem.

### Main Logic Verification:
The main logic of the program is as follows:
1. Generate all subarray sums of the unknown palindrome array `a` using `func_1`.
2. Identify the subarray sums that appear an odd number of times using `func_2`.
3. Reconstruct the palindrome array `a` from the identified sums using `func_3`.

### Issues in the Main Logic:
- **Reconstruction Error:** The reconstruction logic in `func_3` is flawed. The differences between consecutive sums in `odds` do not directly correspond to the elements of the palindrome array. This leads to incorrect reconstructions of the palindrome.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly reconstruct the palindrome array from the given subarray sums due to the flawed reconstruction logic in `func_3`. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
