### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to reconstruct a palindrome array `a` of size `n` given all but one of its subarray sums.
   - The input includes multiple test cases, each with a specific `n` and a list of subarray sums.
   - The goal is to find the missing subarray sum and then reconstruct the palindrome array `a`.

2. **Functions and Their Roles:**
   - **func_1(a):** Generates all subarray sums for a given array `a` and returns them sorted.
   - **func_2(cts):** Removes consecutive duplicate integers from the list `cts`.
   - **func_3(odds, n):** Reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the list `odds` which contains subarray sums.
   - **func_4(bigList, smallList):** Finds the last element in `bigList` that is not in `smallList` by removing common trailing elements.

3. **Execution Flow:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` and the list of subarray sums `subarraySums`.
   - The list `subarraySums` is sorted.
   - The function `func_2` is used to remove consecutive duplicates from `subarraySums`.
   - Depending on the length of the resulting list `odds` from `func_2`, the program either:
     - Uses `func_3` to construct a temporary array `b` of size `n+2` or `n-2`, calculates its subarray sums, and uses `func_4` to find the missing subarray sum.
     - Constructs the final palindrome array `a` using `func_3` with the correct size `n` and the complete list of subarray sums including the missing one.

4. **Validation:**
   - The program handles the removal of consecutive duplicates correctly using `func_2`.
   - The reconstruction of the palindrome array `a` from the subarray sums is done using `func_3`, which places elements symmetrically.
   - The identification of the missing subarray sum is handled by comparing the subarray sums of a constructed array `b` with the given subarray sums using `func_4`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly reconstructs the palindrome array `a` for each test case by leveraging the provided functions to identify and handle the missing subarray sum.
   - The logic and the functions work together as intended to solve the problem.

### Correctness: **True**
