To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand what the loop does. The loop continues to execute as long as `smallList` is not empty and the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal. During each iteration, the last elements of both `bigList` and `smallList` are removed.

Thus, after the loop finishes, `bigList` and `smallList` will have had all their matching trailing elements removed. The elements in `bigList` and `smallList` that do not match at the end will remain unchanged.

Let's assume the initial state for `bigList` and `smallList`:

Initial State: `bigList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `smallList = [3, 4, 5]`

The loop will remove the elements `3`, `4`, and `5` from both lists since they match at the end.

After the loop, `bigList` will be `[1, 2]` and `smallList` will be `[]`.

Output State: **bigList = [1, 2], smallList = []**

In natural language, after the loop finishes, `bigList` will have all the matching trailing elements removed that were also present at the end of `smallList`. `smallList` will be empty if all its elements matched the trailing elements of `bigList`.
