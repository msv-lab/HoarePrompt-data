You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    500000000 1000000000 500000000 500000000 1000000000

Output

    1 2 1 
    7 2 2 7 
    3 5 5 3 
    6 4 4 6 
    1 1 1 1 1 
    2 1 2 1 2 
    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze each function step by step and see if they collectively solve the problem as described.

### Function 1: `func_1(a)`
This function generates all possible subarray sums of the array `a` and returns them in a sorted list. This is a standard way to generate subarray sums, and the sorting step ensures that the sums are in ascending order.

### Function 2: `func_2(cts)`
This function takes a list of subarray sums `cts` and returns a list of sums that appear an odd number of times. The logic here is that if a subarray sum appears an even number of times, it means the subarray occurs in pairs (e.g., [1, 2] and [2, 1] in a palindrome), and if it appears an odd number of times, it means there's an extra occurrence (likely the missing one).

### Function 3: `func_3(odds, n)`
This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the list of sums that appear an odd number of times (`odds`). It starts from the middle of the array and assigns values based on the differences between consecutive sums in `odds`. The logic is that the difference between consecutive sums in `odds` corresponds to the elements in the palindrome array.

### Function 4: `func_4(bigList, smallList)`
This function compares the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` and removes them if they are equal. It continues this process until the last elements are different, at which point it returns the last element of `bigList`. This function seems to be used to find the missing subarray sum, but in the context of the program, it's not directly used to solve the main problem.

### Main Logic
The main logic of the program is as follows:
1. Generate all subarray sums of the unknown palindrome array `a` using `func_1`.
2. Identify the subarray sums that appear an odd number of times using `func_2`.
3. Reconstruct the palindrome array `a` from the identified sums using `func_3`.

### Verification with Example
Let's verify the provided example with the program:

#### Example 1:
Input:
```
3
1 2 3 4 1
```
Output:
```
1 2 1
```
Explanation:
- Subarrays and their sums: [1], [2], [1], [1, 2], [2, 1], [1, 2, 1]
- Sums in ascending order: [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4]
- Odd sums: [2, 4]
- Reconstructed array: [1, 2, 1]

The program correctly reconstructs the palindrome array.

#### Example 2:
Input:
```
4
18 2 11 9 7 11 7 2 9
```
Output:
```
7 2 2 7
```
Explanation:
- Subarrays and their sums: [7], [2], [2], [7], [7, 2], [2, 2], [2, 7], [7, 2, 2], [2, 2, 7], [7, 2, 2, 7]
- Sums in ascending order: [2, 2, 2, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9, 11, 11, 18]
- Odd sums: [9, 18]
- Reconstructed array: [7, 2, 2, 7]

The program correctly reconstructs the palindrome array.

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly reconstructs a palindrome array from the given subarray sums. The logic is sound, and the functions work together to solve the problem as described.
