To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to examine if the program correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
Given the sums of all but one subarray of a palindrome array `a`, we need to reconstruct the array `a`. The array `a` must satisfy the condition `a_i = a_{n + 1 - i}` for all `1 ≤ i ≤ n`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **func_1(a)**: This function generates all subarray sums of the array `a` and returns them in a sorted list.
2. **func_2(cts)**: This function processes the list of subarray sums (`cts`) to find the unique sums, essentially removing pairs of identical sums. This is useful because subarrays like `[1, 2, 1]` and `[2, 1, 2]` will have the same sum, and we need to handle such cases.
3. **func_3(odds, n)**: This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the unique subarray sums (`odds`). It uses the fact that the difference between consecutive sums in the `odds` list corresponds to the elements of the array `a`.
4. **func_4(bigList, smallList)**: This function finds the missing subarray sum by comparing the full list of subarray sums (`bigList`) with the list of provided subarray sums (`smallList`).

### Steps in the Program:
- The program first generates all possible subarray sums for a hypothetical palindrome array `a` using `func_1`.
- It then generates the list of unique subarray sums using `func_2`.
- Using the unique subarray sums, it reconstructs the array `a` using `func_3`.
- Finally, it identifies the missing subarray sum by comparing the full list of subarray sums with the provided subarray sums using `func_4`.

### Key Points:
- The program assumes that the input is well-formed and that there exists at least one valid solution.
- The program correctly handles the symmetry of the palindrome array by ensuring that the reconstructed array `a` satisfies `a_i = a_{n + 1 - i}`.
- The program correctly identifies the missing subarray sum by comparing the full list of subarray sums with the provided subarray sums.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program seems to correctly solve the problem as described. It reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the provided subarray sums and correctly identifies the missing subarray sum.
