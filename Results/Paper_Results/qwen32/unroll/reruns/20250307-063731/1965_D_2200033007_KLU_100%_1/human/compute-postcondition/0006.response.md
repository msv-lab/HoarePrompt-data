Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `odds`, which is a list of integers, and a parameter `n`, which is an odd integer between 3 and 1000. The list `odds` contains subarray sums of a palindrome array `a` of size `n`, with one subarray sum missing. The function returns the list `a` where the middle element is the last element of `odds`, and the other elements are half the difference of consecutive elements in `odds`, symmetrically placed.**
