`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 200. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 1000. The list `s` contains \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\) integers, each representing the sum of a subarray of the palindrome array `a`. Each integer in `s` satisfies 1 ≤ s_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of all `n` over all test cases does not exceed 1000. There is always at least one valid solution for the given input.
