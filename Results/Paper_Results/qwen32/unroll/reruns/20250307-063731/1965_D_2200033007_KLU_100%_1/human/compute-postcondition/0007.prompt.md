You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: odds is a list of integers, and n is an integer such that n is odd and 3 <= n <= 1000. The list odds contains subarray sums of a palindrome array a of size n, with one subarray sum missing.
def func_3(odds, n):
    a = [0] * n
    prev = 0
    idx = (n - 1) // 2
    for x in odds:
        if idx == n - 1 - idx:
            a[idx] = x
        else:
            a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
            a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        
        prev = x
        
        idx = idx - 1
        
    #State: `a` is a list where the middle element is the last element of `odds` and the other elements are half the difference of consecutive elements in `odds`, symmetrically placed; `prev` is the last element of `odds`; `idx` is -1.
    return a
    #The program returns list `a` where the middle element is the last element of `odds` and the other elements are half the difference of consecutive elements in `odds`, symmetrically placed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `odds`, which is a list of integers, and a parameter `n`, which is an odd integer between 3 and 1000. The list `odds` contains subarray sums of a palindrome array `a` of size `n`, with one subarray sum missing. The function returns the list `a` where the middle element is the last element of `odds`, and the other elements are half the difference of consecutive elements in `odds`, symmetrically placed.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns list `a` where the middle element is the last element of `odds` and the other elements are half the difference of consecutive elements in `odds`, symmetrically placed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
