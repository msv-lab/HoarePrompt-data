The function accepts a list of integers `odds` and an odd integer `n` (where 3 <= n <= 1000). The list `odds` contains subarray sums of a palindrome array `a` of size `n`, with one subarray sum missing. The function reconstructs and returns the palindrome array `a` where the middle element is the last element of `odds`, and the other elements are half the difference of consecutive elements in `odds`, symmetrically placed.
