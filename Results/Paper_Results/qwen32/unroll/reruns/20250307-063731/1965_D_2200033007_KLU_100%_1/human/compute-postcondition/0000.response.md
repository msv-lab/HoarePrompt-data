To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to ensure that both conditions in the loop head are satisfied:

1. `len(smallList) > 0` - This condition requires that `smallList` is not empty.
2. `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]` - This condition requires that the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal.

Given the state right before the `while` loop:
- `bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers.
- The function assumes that the elements at the end of both lists are equal when the loop condition is met.

Let's analyze the requirements:

1. **Ensure `smallList` is not empty**: We need to make sure that `smallList` has at least one element.
2. **Ensure the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal**: We need to make sure that the last element of `bigList` is the same as the last element of `smallList`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
- **Adjust `smallList`**: We need to ensure that `smallList` has at least one element. Let's assume that `smallList` initially has one element, say `x`.
- **Adjust `bigList`**: We need to ensure that the last element of `bigList` is also `x` to satisfy the second condition.

### Modified State:
- `smallList` must have at least one element, say `x`.
- `bigList` must have at least one element, and that element must be `x` to match the last element of `smallList`.

State: **`bigList` is a list ending with `x`, `smallList` is a list ending with `x`**

This ensures that both conditions of the `while` loop are met, allowing the first iteration to proceed.
