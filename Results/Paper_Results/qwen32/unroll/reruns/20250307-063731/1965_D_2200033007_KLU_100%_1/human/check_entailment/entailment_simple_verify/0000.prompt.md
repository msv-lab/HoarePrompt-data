You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    6 4 4 6 
    1 1 1 1 1 
    2 1 2 1 2 
    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program consists of four functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4`. Here's a breakdown of what each function does:

1. **func_1(a)**: This function generates all possible subarray sums of the array `a` and returns them in sorted order.
2. **func_2(cts)**: This function takes the list of subarray sums (`cts`) and returns the list of sums that appear an odd number of times. This is because the missing subarray sum will be the only one that appears an odd number of times.
3. **func_3(odds, n)**: This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the list of sums that appear an odd number of times (`odds`). It fills the array symmetrically based on the differences between consecutive sums in `odds`.
4. **func_4(bigList, smallList)**: This function finds the missing subarray sum by comparing the list of all subarray sums (`bigList`) with the list of sums that appear an odd number of times (`smallList`). It removes common elements from the end of both lists and returns the last element of `bigList`, which is the missing sum.

### Correctness Check

The program's flow seems logical, but let's check if it handles all edge cases correctly and if it meets the problem's requirements.

#### Edge Cases

1. **Single Missing Subarray Sum**: The program correctly identifies the missing subarray sum by finding the odd one out.
2. **Palindrome Structure**: The reconstructed array `a` is a palindrome, as the function `func_3` ensures that `a[i] = a[n-1-i]`.
3. **Multiple Test Cases**: The program handles multiple test cases by iterating through each test case and applying the same logic.

However, there are a few concerns:

- **Handling of Odd and Even Length Palindromes**: The program should handle both odd and even length palindromes correctly. The function `func_3` seems to handle this correctly by checking if the index is in the middle and assigning the value directly.
- **Correctness of Subarray Sums**: The function `func_1` generates all subarray sums correctly, and `func_2` identifies the missing sum correctly.
- **Reconstruction of the Array**: The function `func_3` reconstructs the array symmetrically, which is correct for a palindrome.

### Potential Issues

The main issue lies in the function `func_4`, which is supposed to find the missing subarray sum. However, the function's logic is flawed. It assumes that the missing subarray sum is the last element of `bigList` after removing common elements from the end of both lists. This is not necessarily true, as the missing subarray sum could be any element in `bigList` that is not in `smallList`.

### Correctness Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly identify the missing subarray sum in all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation

The function `func_4` is incorrect because it does not correctly identify the missing subarray sum. The missing subarray sum could be any element in `bigList` that is not in `smallList`, and the current implementation does not guarantee this. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case.
