To determine the correctness of the given program, let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, the annotations, and the original assessment.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires reconstructing a palindrome array `a` of size `n` given all but one of its subarray sums. The key points are:
1. The array `a` is a palindrome.
2. We are given \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\) subarray sums.
3. We need to identify the missing subarray sum and use the remaining sums to reconstruct the array.

### Code Analysis

Let's break down the code and verify each function.

#### Function 1: `func_1(a)`
- **Purpose**: Generate all subarray sums of the array `a` and return them in a sorted list.
- **Implementation**: Iterates through the array to compute cumulative sums for each starting index and appends them to `cts`. The list `cts` is then sorted.
- **Annotation**: Correctly described as generating all cumulative sums and sorting them.

#### Function 2: `func_2(cts)`
- **Purpose**: Identify subarray sums that appear an odd number of times.
- **Implementation**: Iterates through `cts` and uses a list `odds` to keep track of sums that appear an odd number of times by adding them if they are not already present and removing them if they are.
- **Annotation**: Correctly described as removing consecutive duplicates, which effectively identifies sums appearing an odd number of times.

#### Function 3: `func_3(odds, n)`
- **Purpose**: Reconstruct the palindrome array `a` from the list of sums that appear an odd number of times.
- **Implementation**: Initializes an array `a` of size `n` with zeros. Iterates through `odds`, calculating the middle element and symmetrically placing other elements based on the differences between consecutive sums.
- **Annotation**: Correctly described as reconstructing the palindrome array from the identified sums.

#### Function 4: `func_4(bigList, smallList)`
- **Purpose**: Find the missing subarray sum by comparing and removing matching elements from the end of `bigList` and `smallList`.
- **Implementation**: Removes elements from the end of `bigList` and `smallList` as long as they are equal and returns the last element of `bigList`.
- **Annotation**: Correctly described as finding the missing subarray sum by comparing and removing matching elements.

### Main Logic

1. **Generate Subarray Sums**: `func_1` generates all subarray sums and sorts them.
2. **Identify Odd Sums**: `func_2` identifies sums that appear an odd number of times.
3. **Reconstruct Array**: `func_3` reconstructs the palindrome array from the identified sums.
4. **Determine Missing Sum**: The logic for determining the missing sum is complex and involves additional checks and calculations.

### Verification with Example

Let's verify the provided example with the program:

#### Example 1:
Input:
```
3
1 2 3 4 1
```
Output:
```
1 2 1
```
Explanation:
- Subarrays and their sums: [1], [2], [1], [1, 2], [2, 1], [1, 2, 1]
- Sums in ascending order: [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4]
- Odd sums: [2, 4]
- Reconstructed array: [1, 2, 1]

#### Example 2:
Input:
```
4
18 2 11 9 7 11 7 2 9
```
Output:
```
7 2 2 7
```
Explanation:
- Subarrays and their sums: [7], [2], [2], [7], [7, 2], [2, 2], [2, 7], [7, 2, 2], [2, 2, 7], [7, 2, 2, 7]
- Sums in ascending order: [2, 2, 2, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9, 11, 11, 18]
- Odd sums: [9, 18]
- Reconstructed array: [7, 2, 2, 7]
