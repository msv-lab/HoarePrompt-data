#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `odds` and an odd integer `n` (where 3 <= n <= 1000).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: bigList and smallList are lists of integers, and the function assumes that the elements at the end of both lists are equal when the loop condition is met.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists of integers, `bigList` and `smallList`. It modifies `bigList` by removing elements from its end as long as the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal. The function returns the last element of the modified `bigList`.
