### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all \( n \) buns, where the first \( k \) buns are sold at a modified price and the remaining \( n-k \) buns are sold at the usual price. The price of the \( i \)-th bun (for \( 1 \leq i \leq k \)) is \( b - i + 1 \) coins. The task is to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.

**Function `func_1`**:
- This function calculates the profit for a given \( k \) using the formula:
  \[
  k \times b - k \times \left(\frac{k - 1}{2}\right) + (n - k) \times a
  \]
  It computes the profit when selling the first \( k \) buns at the modified price and the remaining \( n-k \) buns at the usual price.

**Function `func_2`**:
- This function performs a binary search to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
- It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to \(\min(n, b)\).
- It iteratively calculates the profit for the middle point (`mid`) and the next point (`mid + 1`).
- It updates `max_profit` with the maximum profit found so far.
- If the profit at `mid + 1` is greater than the profit at `mid`, it moves the `low` boundary up to `mid + 1`; otherwise, it moves the `high` boundary down to `mid - 1`.
- The process continues until `low` exceeds `high`, and the function returns the maximum profit found.

### Analysis:

- The binary search in `func_2` is correctly implemented to find the maximum profit.
- The profit calculation in `func_1` is accurate according to the problem statement.
- The constraints \( 0 \leq k \leq n \) and \( 1 \leq n, a, b \leq 10^9 \) are handled appropriately within the binary search and profit calculation.
- The program efficiently handles up to 10^4 test cases due to the binary search approach, which operates in \( O(\log(\min(n, b))) \) time for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all \( n \) buns under the given promotion rules.
