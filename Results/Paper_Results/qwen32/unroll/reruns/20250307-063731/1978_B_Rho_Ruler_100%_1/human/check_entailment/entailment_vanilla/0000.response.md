To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the problem and the code step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the profit from selling `n` buns. The price of the first `k` buns is modified such that the `i-th` bun (for `1 <= i <= k`) is sold at `(b - i + 1)` coins. The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each.

### Key Observations:
1. **Profit Calculation**:
   - For `k` buns sold at modified prices, the profit is the sum of the series `(b - 0) + (b - 1) + (b - 2) + ... + (b - k + 1)`. This can be simplified to `k * b - k * (k - 1) / 2`.
   - For the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price, the profit is `(n - k) * a`.
   - Total profit for a given `k` is `k * b - k * (k - 1) / 2 + (n - k) * a`.

2. **Maximizing Profit**:
   - The problem is to find the `k` that maximizes the total profit.
   - The profit function is quadratic in terms of `k` and opens downwards (since the term `-k * (k - 1) / 2` is quadratic with a negative leading coefficient), indicating a single maximum point.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the profit for a given `k`, `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - The formula used is correct as per the problem statement: `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function finds the `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It uses binary search to efficiently find the maximum profit.
   - The search range is `[0, min(n, b)]` because selling more than `b` buns at modified prices doesn't make sense since the price would become non-positive.
   - The binary search correctly updates the search range based on the comparison of profits at `mid` and `mid + 1`, ensuring the maximum profit is found.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit by utilizing the properties of the profit function and efficiently searching for the optimal `k` using binary search.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
