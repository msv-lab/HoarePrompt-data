To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify whether it correctly computes the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all \( n \) buns under the specified conditions.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the profit if Bob sells the first \( k \) buns at the modified price and the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price.
   - The modified price for the \( i \)-th bun (where \( 1 \leq i \leq k \)) is \( b - i + 1 \).
   - The profit from selling the first \( k \) buns is given by the sum of the arithmetic series \( b + (b-1) + ... + (b-k+1) \), which can be computed as \( k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} \).
   - The profit from selling the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price is \( (n - k) \cdot a \).
   - Therefore, the total profit is \( k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a \).

2. **Function `func_2(n, a, b)`**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
   - The search range for \( k \) is from 0 to \( \min(n, b) \).
   - For each midpoint \( mid \) in the search range, it calculates the profit for \( mid \) and \( mid + 1 \).
   - It updates the maximum profit found so far and adjusts the search range based on the comparison of the profits for \( mid \) and \( mid + 1 \).

### Correctness of the Program

The program uses binary search to efficiently find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit. Given the constraints \( 1 \leq n, a, b \leq 10^9 \), this approach is efficient and feasible.

The logic for calculating the profit in `func_1` is correct. The binary search in `func_2` ensures that the optimal \( k \) is found by comparing the profit at the midpoint and the next point, adjusting the search range accordingly.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all \( n \) buns under the given conditions.
