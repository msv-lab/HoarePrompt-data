### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Recap:
- Bob sells `n` buns.
- The usual price of a bun is `a` coins.
- For the first `k` buns, the price of the `i-th` bun is `(b - i + 1)` coins.
- The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at `a` coins each.
- The goal is to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by choosing an optimal `k`.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Profit Calculation**:
   - For `k` buns sold at modified prices, the profit is the sum of the series `(b - 0) + (b - 1) + (b - 2) + ... + (b - k + 1)`. This can be simplified to `k * b - k * (k - 1) / 2`.
   - For the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price, the profit is `(n - k) * a`.
   - Total profit for a given `k` is `k * b - k * (k - 1) / 2 + (n - k) * a`.

2. **Maximizing Profit**:
   - The profit function is quadratic in terms of `k` and opens downwards, indicating a single maximum point.
   - The maximum profit can be found by iterating through possible values of `k` or using a more efficient method like binary search.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the profit for a given `k`, `n`, `a`, and `b` using the formula `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.
   - The formula is correctly implemented based on the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function finds the `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It uses binary search to efficiently find the maximum profit.
   - The search range is `[0, min(n, b)]` because selling more than `b` buns at modified prices doesn't make sense since the price would become non-positive.
   - The binary search correctly updates the search range based on the comparison of profits at `mid` and `mid + 1`, ensuring the maximum profit is found.

#### Verification Using Annotations:
- The annotations describe the state of the program before and after key operations.
- The annotations confirm that the binary search correctly narrows down the range to find the maximum profit.
- The annotations also confirm that the profit calculation in `func_1` is correct.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit by utilizing the properties of the profit function and efficiently searching for the optimal `k` using binary search. The annotations validate the correctness of the code.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
