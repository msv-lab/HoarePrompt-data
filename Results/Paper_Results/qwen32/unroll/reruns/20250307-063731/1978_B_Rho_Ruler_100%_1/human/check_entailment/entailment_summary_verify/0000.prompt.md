You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    7
    
    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(k, n, a, b):
    return k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (0, min(n, b))
    max_profit = 0
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)
        profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
        if profit_next > profit_mid:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return max_profit



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` takes three integer parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`, each ranging from 1 to 10^9 inclusive. It calculates and returns `max_profit`, which represents the maximum profit achievable through a binary search process based on the given inputs.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to ensure that it calculates the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all \( n \) buns according to the given promotion rules.

### Analysis of the Provided Code

The provided code consists of two functions:

1. **`func_1(k, n, a, b)`**: This function calculates the profit if Bob sells the first \( k \) buns at the modified price and the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price.
2. **`func_2(n, a, b)`**: This function uses binary search to find the value of \( k \) that maximizes the profit by comparing the profit for \( k \) and \( k + 1 \).

#### Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`

The formula used in `func_1` is:
\[ \text{profit} = k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a \]

This formula correctly calculates the profit by:
- Selling the first \( k \) buns at prices \( b, b-1, b-2, \ldots, b-k+1 \).
- Selling the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price \( a \).

#### Function `func_2(n, a, b)`

The function `func_2` performs a binary search to find the maximum profit:
- It initializes the range for \( k \) as \( [0, \min(n, b)] \).
- It iteratively narrows down the range by comparing the profit for \( k \) and \( k + 1 \).
- It updates the maximum profit found during the search.

### Verification

Let's verify the correctness of the code by checking if it handles various edge cases and examples provided in the problem description.

#### Edge Cases:
1. **\( k = 0 \)**: All buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).
2. **\( k = n \)**: All buns are sold at the modified price.
3. **\( b < n \)**: The maximum \( k \) is limited by \( b \).
4. **\( a = b \)**: The profit calculation should handle the case where the usual price and modified price are the same.
5. **Large values of \( n, a, b \)**: The code should handle large inputs efficiently.

#### Test Cases:
1. **Input**: \( n = 4, a = 4, b = 5 \)
   - Expected Output: 17
   - Explanation: Selling 1 bun at 5 coins and the remaining 3 buns at 4 coins each.

   - Explanation: Selling all buns at the usual price.

   - Explanation: Selling all buns at the usual price.
7. **Input**: \( n = 1000, a = 1, b = 1000 \)
   - Expected Output: 500500
   - Explanation: Selling all 1000 buns at modified prices.

### Conclusion

The provided code correctly handles the problem requirements and all the test cases mentioned. It efficiently finds the maximum profit using binary search and correctly calculates the profit for different values of \( k \).

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
