Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9; `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9; `b` is an integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is min(n, b)**

Natural language: The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` retain their initial values, which are integers within the range of 1 to 10^9. The variable `low` is set to 0, and the variable `high` is set to the minimum value between `n` and `b`.
