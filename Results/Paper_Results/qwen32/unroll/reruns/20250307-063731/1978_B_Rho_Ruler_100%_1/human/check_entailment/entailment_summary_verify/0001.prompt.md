You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(k, n, a, b):
    return k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (0, min(n, b))
    max_profit = 0
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)
        profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
        if profit_next > profit_mid:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return max_profit



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` takes three integer parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`, each ranging from 1 to 10^9 inclusive. It calculates and returns `max_profit`, which represents the maximum profit achievable through a binary search process based on the given inputs.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the problem and the code step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the profit from selling `n` buns. The price of the first `k` buns is modified such that the `i-th` bun (for `1 <= i <= k`) is sold at `(b - i + 1)` coins. The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each.

### Key Observations:
1. **Profit Calculation**:
   - For `k` buns sold at modified prices, the profit is the sum of the series `(b - 0) + (b - 1) + (b - 2) + ... + (b - k + 1)`. This can be simplified to `k * b - k * (k - 1) / 2`.
   - For the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price, the profit is `(n - k) * a`.
   - Total profit for a given `k` is `k * b - k * (k - 1) / 2 + (n - k) * a`.

2. **Maximizing Profit**:
   - The problem is to find the `k` that maximizes the total profit.
   - The profit function is quadratic in terms of `k` and opens downwards (since the term `-k * (k - 1) / 2` is quadratic with a negative leading coefficient), indicating a single maximum point.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the profit for a given `k`, `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - The formula used is correct as per the problem statement: `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function finds the `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It uses binary search to efficiently find the maximum profit.
   - The search range is `[0, min(n, b)]` because selling more than `b` buns at modified prices doesn't make sense since the price would become non-positive.
   - The binary search correctly updates the search range based on the comparison of profits at `mid` and `mid + 1`, ensuring the maximum profit is found.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit by utilizing the properties of the profit function and efficiently searching for the optimal `k` using binary search.

Therefore, the given program is correct.
