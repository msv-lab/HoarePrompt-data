### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the provided program based on the problem description, the code, and the function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap:
Bob sells buns with a promotion where the first \( k \) buns are sold at decreasing prices starting from \( b \) down to \( b - k + 1 \), and the remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \). The goal is to determine the maximum profit Bob can make.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1(k, n, a, b)`**: Computes the profit for a specific \( k \).
2. **`func_2(n, a, b)`**: Uses binary search to find the maximum profit by comparing profits for different values of \( k \).

##### Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`:
The formula used is:
\[ \text{profit} = k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a \]
This formula correctly calculates:
- The sum of the first \( k \) terms of the sequence \( b, b-1, b-2, \ldots, b-k+1 \), which is \( k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} \).
- The profit from selling the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price \( a \), which is \( (n - k) \cdot a \).

##### Function `func_2(n, a, b)`:
This function performs a binary search to find the optimal \( k \):
- It initializes the search range from 0 to \( \min(n, b) \).
- It compares the profit at the midpoint \( k \) and \( k + 1 \) to adjust the search range.
- It keeps track of the maximum profit found.

#### Verification:
Let's verify the correctness by checking the edge cases and test cases provided in the problem description.

##### Edge Cases:
1. **\( k = 0 \)**: All buns sold at the usual price \( a \).
2. **\( k = n \)**: All buns sold at the modified price.
3. **\( b < n \)**: The maximum \( k \) is limited by \( b \).
4. **\( a = b \)**: The profit calculation should handle the case where the usual price and modified price are the same.
5. **Large values of \( n, a, b \)**: The code should handle large inputs efficiently.

##### Test Cases:
1. **Input**: \( n = 4, a = 4, b = 5 \)
   - Expected Output: 17
   - Explanation: Selling 1 bun at 5 coins and the remaining 3 buns at 4 coins each.
2. **Input**: \( n = 5, a = 5, b = 9 \)
   - Expected Output: 35
   - Explanation: Selling all 5 buns at modified prices.
3. **Input**: \( n = 10, a = 10, b = 5 \)
   - Expected Output: 100
   - Explanation: Selling all buns at the usual price.
4. **Input**: \( n = 5, a = 5, b = 11 \)
   - Expected Output: 45
   - Explanation: Selling all 5 buns at modified prices.
5. **Input**: \( n = 1000000000, a = 1000000000, b = 1000000000 \)
   - Expected Output: 1000000000000000000
   - Explanation: Selling all buns at the usual price.
6. **Input**: \( n = 1000000000, a = 1000000000, b = 1 \)
   - Expected Output: 1000000000000000000
   - Explanation: Selling all buns at the usual price.
7. **Input**: \( n = 1000, a = 1, b = 1000 \)
   - Expected Output: 500500
   - Explanation: Selling all 1000 buns at modified prices.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum profit by selling buns according to the given promotion rules and handles all edge cases and test cases as expected. The binary search approach in `func_2` efficiently finds the optimal \( k \) to maximize the profit.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
