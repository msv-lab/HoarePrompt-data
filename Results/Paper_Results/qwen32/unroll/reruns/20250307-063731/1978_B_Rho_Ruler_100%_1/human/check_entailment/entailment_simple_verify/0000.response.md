### Reasoning:

To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to ensure that it accurately calculates the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all \( n \) buns according to the given promotion rules. Let's systematically analyze the code and annotations to validate the original assessment.

#### Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`

This function calculates the profit for a given \( k \) using the formula:
\[ \text{profit} = k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a \]

**Annotations:**
- The function takes parameters \( k \), \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
- It computes the profit by selling the first \( k \) buns at decreasing prices starting from \( b \) and the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price \( a \).

**Verification:**
- The formula correctly accounts for the sum of the first \( k \) terms of the arithmetic sequence starting from \( b \) and decreasing by 1 each step.
- The remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).

#### Function `func_2(n, a, b)`

This function uses binary search to find the value of \( k \) that maximizes the profit.

**Annotations:**
- The function initializes the search range for \( k \) as \( [0, \min(n, b)] \).
- It performs binary search by comparing the profit for \( k \) and \( k + 1 \).
- It updates the maximum profit found during the search.

**Verification:**
- The binary search efficiently narrows down the range to find the optimal \( k \).
- The conditions for updating `low` and `high` ensure that the search converges to the maximum profit.

#### Test Cases

Let's verify the correctness of the code by checking if it handles various edge cases and examples provided in the problem description.

**Edge Cases:**
1. **\( k = 0 \)**: All buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).
2. **\( k = n \)**: All buns are sold at the modified price.
3. **\( b < n \)**: The maximum \( k \) is limited by \( b \).
4. **\( a = b \)**: The profit calculation should handle the case where the usual price and modified price are the same.
5. **Large values of \( n, a, b \)**: The code should handle large inputs efficiently.

**Test Cases:**
1. **Input**: \( n = 4, a = 4, b = 5 \)
   - Expected Output: 17
   - Explanation: Selling 1 bun at 5 coins and the remaining 3 buns at 4 coins each.
2. **Input**: \( n = 5, a = 5, b = 9 \)
   - Expected Output: 35
   - Explanation: Selling all 5 buns at modified prices.
3. **Input**: \( n = 10, a = 10, b = 5 \)
   - Expected Output: 100
   - Explanation: Selling all buns at the usual price.
4. **Input**: \( n = 5, a = 5, b = 11 \)
   - Expected Output: 45
   - Explanation: Selling all 5 buns at modified prices.
5. **Input**: \( n = 1000000000, a = 1000000000, b = 1000000000 \)
   - Expected Output: 1000000000000000000
   - Explanation: Selling all buns at the usual price.
6. **Input**: \( n = 1000000000, a = 1000000000, b = 1 \)
   - Expected Output: 1000000000000000000
   - Explanation: Selling all buns at the usual price.
7. **Input**: \( n = 1000, a = 1, b = 1000 \)
   - Expected Output: 500500
   - Explanation: Selling all 1000 buns at modified prices.

### Conclusion

The provided code correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum profit by selling buns according to the given promotion rules and handles all edge cases and test cases as expected. The binary search efficiently finds the optimal \( k \), and the profit calculation is accurate.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: True**
