Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum profit Bob can achieve by selling `n` buns with a promotional pricing strategy. The strategy involves selling the first `k` buns at a decreasing price starting from `b` coins down to `(b - k + 1)` coins, and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a` coins each.

The function `func_1` calculates the profit for a given `k` using the formula:
\[ \text{profit} = k \times b - k \times \left(\frac{k - 1}{2}\right) + (n - k) \times a \]

This formula correctly accounts for the sum of the first `k` terms of the decreasing price sequence and adds the profit from the remaining buns sold at the usual price.

The function `func_2` performs a binary search over the possible values of `k` (from 0 to `min(n, b)`) to find the value of `k` that maximizes the profit. It does this by comparing the profit at the midpoint `mid` with the profit at `mid + 1` and adjusting the search range accordingly. The maximum profit found during this search is returned.

The binary search approach is efficient and suitable given the constraints (up to \(10^9\) for `n`, `a`, and `b`), as it reduces the number of profit calculations to \(O(\log(\min(n, b)))\).

The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit for each test case, as described in the problem statement and the annotations.

Correctness: **True**
