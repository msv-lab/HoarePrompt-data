To determine the output state after the loop, we need to understand what the loop is doing. The loop is performing a binary search to find the maximum profit that can be achieved by calling the function `func_1` with different values of `mid`. The variable `mid` starts at the midpoint of `low` and `high`, and the search space is adjusted based on the comparison of `profit_mid` and `profit_next`.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the loop:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `low` is initialized to 0.
   - `high` is initialized to `min(n, b)`.
   - `max_profit` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - `mid` is calculated as the integer division of `(low + high) // 2`.
   - `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`.
   - `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`.
   - `max_profit` is updated to the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`.
   - If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, `low` is set to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, `high` is set to `mid - 1`.

The loop effectively finds the value of `mid` that maximizes `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`. After the loop, `low` will be greater than `high`, and `max_profit` will hold the maximum profit found.

**Output State:**
- `low` will be greater than `high`.
- `high` will be the last value that was checked and found to not yield a higher profit than the next value.
- `max_profit` will be the maximum profit found during the binary search.

Given the above explanation, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **low > high, high is the last checked value, max_profit is the maximum profit found.**
