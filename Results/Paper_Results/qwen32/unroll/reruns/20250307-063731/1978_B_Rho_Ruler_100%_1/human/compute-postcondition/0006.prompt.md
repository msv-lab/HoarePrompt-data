You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.
def func_2(n, a, b):
    low, high = 0, min(n, b)
    max_profit = 0
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)
        
        profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)
        
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
        
        if profit_next > profit_mid:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State: - `low` will be greater than `high`.
    #- `high` will be the last value that was checked and found to not yield a higher profit than the next value.
    #- `max_profit` will be the maximum profit found during the binary search.
    #
    #Given the above explanation, the final output state can be described as follows:
    #
    #Output State:
    return max_profit
    #The program returns max_profit, which is the maximum profit found during the binary search.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts three integer parameters `n`, `a`, and `b` where each is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. It performs a binary search to determine and returns `max_profit`, which is the maximum profit that can be achieved based on the given inputs.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns max_profit, which is the maximum profit found during the binary search.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
