### Reasoning:

The problem requires Bob to maximize his profit by selling buns using a promotional pricing strategy for the first `k` buns. The price of the `i`-th bun (1 ≤ i ≤ k) is `(b - i + 1)`, and the remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

The program uses a binary search approach to find the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the profit. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the total profit for a given `k`.
   - The profit from the first `k` buns is calculated as `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2`. This is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - k + 1`.
   - The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns is `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two values.

2. **Function `func_2(n, a, b)`**:
   - This function performs a binary search to find the value of `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `min(n, b)`, as `k` cannot exceed the number of buns or the promotional price `b`.
   - It iteratively calculates the profit for the middle point `mid` and the next point `mid + 1` using `func_1`.
   - It updates `max_profit` with the maximum profit found so far.
   - It adjusts the search range based on whether the profit at `mid + 1` is greater than the profit at `mid`.

3. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search efficiently narrows down the optimal `k` by comparing the profit at `mid` and `mid + 1`.
   - If the profit at `mid + 1` is higher, it means the optimal `k` is likely to be in the higher half, so `low` is updated to `mid + 1`.
   - If the profit at `mid + 1` is not higher, it means the optimal `k` is in the lower half or at `mid`, so `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.
   - The loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`, at which point `max_profit` holds the maximum profit found.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the maximum profit for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit by using a binary search to determine the optimal `k`. It handles all edge cases and efficiently computes the result within the given constraints.

**Correctness: **True**
