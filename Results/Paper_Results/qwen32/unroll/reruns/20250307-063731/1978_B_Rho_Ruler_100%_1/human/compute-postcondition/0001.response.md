The code snippet provided initializes a variable `max_profit` to 0. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this initialization.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9; `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9; `b` is an integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is min(n, b); `max_profit` is 0.**
