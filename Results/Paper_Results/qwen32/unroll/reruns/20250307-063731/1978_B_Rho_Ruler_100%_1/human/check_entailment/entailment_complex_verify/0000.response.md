### Reasoning:

The provided code consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which work together to determine the maximum profit Bob can achieve by selling his buns according to the given promotion rules. Let's analyze the correctness of the code based on the problem description and the annotated version.

#### Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`

This function calculates the profit if Bob sells the first \( k \) buns at the modified price and the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price. The formula used is:

\[ \text{profit} = k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a \]

- **Breaking down the formula:**
  - \( k \cdot b \) is the total revenue from selling the first \( k \) buns at the modified price.
  - \( \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} \) is the discount applied to the first \( k \) buns, as the price decreases by 1 for each subsequent bun.
  - \( (n - k) \cdot a \) is the total revenue from selling the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price.

The formula correctly calculates the profit for any given \( k \).

#### Function `func_2(n, a, b)`

This function uses binary search to find the value of \( k \) that maximizes the profit. Here's how it works:
- It initializes the range for \( k \) as \( [0, \min(n, b)] \).
- It iteratively narrows down the range by comparing the profit for \( k \) and \( k + 1 \).
- It updates the maximum profit found during the search.

The binary search approach is efficient and ensures that the function finds the optimal \( k \) in \( O(\log(\min(n, b))) \) time.

#### Verification with Test Cases

Let's verify the correctness of the code using the provided test cases:

1. **Input**: \( n = 4, a = 4, b = 5 \)
   - Expected Output: 17
   - Calculation: Selling 1 bun at 5 coins and the remaining 3 buns at 4 coins each.
   - `func_2(4, 4, 5)` should return 17.

2. **Input**: \( n = 5, a = 5, b = 9 \)
   - Expected Output: 35
   - Calculation: Selling all 5 buns at modified prices.
   - `func_2(5, 5, 9)` should return 35.

3. **Input**: \( n = 10, a = 10, b = 5 \)
   - Expected Output: 100
   - Calculation: Selling all buns at the usual price.
   - `func_2(10, 10, 5)` should return 100.

4. **Input**: \( n = 5, a = 5, b = 11 \)
   - Expected Output: 45
   - Calculation: Selling all 5 buns at modified prices.
   - `func_2(5, 5, 11)` should return 45.

5. **Input**: \( n = 1000000000, a = 1000000000, b = 1000000000 \)
   - Expected Output: 1000000000000000000
   - Calculation: Selling all buns at the usual price.
   - `func_2(1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000)` should return 1000000000000000000.

6. **Input**: \( n = 1000000000, a = 1000000000, b = 1 \)
   - Expected Output: 1000000000000000000
   - Calculation: Selling all buns at the usual price.
   - `func_2(1000000000, 1000000000, 1)` should return 1000000000000000000.

7. **Input**: \( n = 1000, a = 1, b = 1000 \)
   - Expected Output: 500500
   - Calculation: Selling all 1000 buns at modified prices.
   - `func_2(1000, 1, 1000)` should return 500500.

The annotated version confirms that the code correctly implements the logic and handles the edge cases and test cases as expected.

### Conclusion

The provided code correctly calculates the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all \( n \) buns according to the given promotion rules. It handles all edge cases and test cases as expected.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: True**
