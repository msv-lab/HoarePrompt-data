To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `low <= high` is satisfied. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9
- `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9
- `b` is an integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9
- `low` is 0
- `high` is min(n, b)
- `max_profit` is 0

The loop condition `low <= high` will be true as long as `high` is at least 0. Since `high` is defined as `min(n, b)` and both `n` and `b` are at least 1, `high` will also be at least 1. Therefore, the condition `low <= high` will always be true with the given initial conditions.

No adjustments are needed because the loop can certainly execute one time with the provided state.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9; `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9; `b` is an integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is min(n, b); `max_profit` is 0**
