There are multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of columns in a 2 × n grid, followed by two binary strings of length n representing the top and bottom rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
