Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of different final configurations for the given problem. Let's analyze why:

1. **Counting the Moves**: The program correctly counts the number of moves `num` that have been played, taking into account whether the computer can mirror the moves or not. However, this count does not directly help in determining the number of final configurations.

2. **Remaining Moves**: The variable `m` represents the remaining cells where rooks can be placed. If `m == 0` or `m == 1`, the program correctly returns 1, as there is only one way to place rooks in these scenarios.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The program uses a dynamic programming (DP) approach to calculate the number of configurations for the remaining cells. However, the DP transition formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is incorrect for this problem.

   The DP formula should consider the placement of rooks in such a way that no two rooks attack each other, and the computer mirrors your moves. The correct DP formula involves considering the placement of rooks in two scenarios:
   - Placing a rook in a cell that the computer cannot mirror.
   - Placing a rook in a cell that the computer can mirror, and then considering the placement of the mirrored rook.

   The correct DP formula for this problem is more complex and involves considering the number of ways to place rooks in a way that respects the constraints of the problem.

4. **Correct Approach**: A correct approach would involve using combinatorial mathematics to determine the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining cells, taking into account the constraints of the problem. This involves calculating the number of derangements (permutations where no element appears in its original position) and considering the placement of rooks in cells that the computer can mirror.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem, and the correctness is **False**.
