You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

    90 91

Output

    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of a grid of size `n` and `k` moves. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the number of moves and their positions on the grid. The result is derived from a dynamic programming approach that considers the remaining cells after the moves and computes a value modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the provided program is correct, we need to carefully analyze the problem and the given solution. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We have an n x n chessboard.
   - Players take turns placing rooks: white rooks by the human player and black rooks by the computer.
   - Rooks cannot attack each other, which means no two rooks can be in the same row or column.
   - The computer mirrors the player's moves unless the move is on the diagonal (r = c), in which case the computer skips.
   - We need to find the number of different final configurations of the board after k moves by the player and the corresponding computer moves.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If a rook is placed on the diagonal (r = c), it doesn't allow the computer to place a rook, reducing the number of positions available by 1.
   - If a rook is placed off the diagonal, it reduces the number of positions available by 2 (one for the player and one for the computer).
   - The number of remaining positions (m) after k moves is calculated as `m = n - num`, where `num` is the total reduction in positions due to the k moves.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The problem is then transformed into finding the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining m positions.
   - The dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` is used to store the number of ways to place rooks in `i` positions.
   - The base cases are:
     - `dp[1] = 1`: One way to place a rook in one position.
     - `dp[2] = 3`: Three ways to place rooks in two positions (two ways for each player to place one rook, and one way for both to place rooks in opposite positions).
   - The recurrence relation is:
     - `dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2`: This accounts for placing a rook in one of the positions and then placing the remaining rooks in the remaining positions, considering the mirroring.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `m = 0`, there's only one configuration (no more rooks can be placed).
   - If `m = 1`, there's only one configuration (one rook can be placed in the remaining position).

5. **Verification**:
   - The provided solution correctly handles the base cases and uses the DP relation to compute the number of configurations for larger values of `m`.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.
