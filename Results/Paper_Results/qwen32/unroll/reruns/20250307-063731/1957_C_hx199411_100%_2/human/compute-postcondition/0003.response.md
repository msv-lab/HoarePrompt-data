Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the size of the grid and an integer `k` representing the number of moves. It also receives `k` pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)` representing the moves made on the grid. The function returns the result of each test case, which is not specified in detail here, but it implies some computation based on the grid size and the moves made.**
