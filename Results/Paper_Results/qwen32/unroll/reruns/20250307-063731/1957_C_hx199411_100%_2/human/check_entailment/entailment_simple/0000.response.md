### Reasoning:
The given problem involves a specific game played on an n x n chessboard with the following rules:
- Players alternate turns placing white and black rooks respectively.
- Rooks cannot attack each other, meaning no two rooks can be in the same row or column.
- If a player places a rook at (r, c), the opponent places a rook at (c, r) unless r = c, in which case the opponent skips a turn.
- The goal is to determine the number of different final configurations possible after k moves have already been played.

The given code attempts to solve this problem by:
1. Reading the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, reading the size of the board (n) and the number of moves already played (k).
3. For each move, it checks if the move is on the diagonal (r == c). If so, it increments a counter by 1; otherwise, it increments by 2.
4. It then calculates the number of remaining moves (m) that can be played.
5. If m is 0 or 1, it directly prints 1 as there's only one possible configuration.
6. For m > 1, it uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of configurations:
   - It initializes a list `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of configurations possible with i remaining moves.
   - It sets `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - It then fills in the `dp` list using the relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
7. Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

The logic of the dynamic programming part is based on the observation that:
- For 1 remaining move, there is only 1 way to place the rook.
- For 2 remaining moves, there are 3 ways to place the rooks (either both on the diagonal or in one of the two off-diagonal pairs).
- For more than 2 moves, the number of configurations can be derived from the previous values using the given recurrence relation.

The provided code correctly implements this logic and should produce the correct results for the given problem.
