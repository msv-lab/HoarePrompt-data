Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code does not correctly compute the number of possible final configurations for a given chessboard and initial moves.

The main issue lies in the dynamic programming (DP) approach used to calculate the number of configurations. The current implementation of the DP array `dp` does not account for the correct transitions and constraints of the problem, especially when considering the mirroring of moves and the final configurations.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3 1
1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- The initial state has a white rook at (1, 2) and a black rook at (2, 1).
- The remaining valid positions for placing rooks are (1, 3), (2, 3), and (3, 3).
- The possible configurations are:
  1. Place a white rook at (1, 3) and a black rook at (3, 1).
  2. Place a white rook at (2, 3) and a black rook at (3, 2).
  3. Place a white rook at (3, 3) and no further moves are possible.

However, the provided code will not correctly compute this for all test cases, particularly those with larger `n` and `k` values.

To correctly solve this problem, the DP approach should be revised to account for the constraints and transitions accurately. The current implementation seems to have a flawed logic in the DP transition formula, which leads to incorrect results for certain inputs.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
