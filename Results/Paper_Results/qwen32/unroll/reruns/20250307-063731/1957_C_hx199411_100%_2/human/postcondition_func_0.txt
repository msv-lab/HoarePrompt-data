The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of a grid of size `n` and `k` moves. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the number of moves and their positions on the grid. The result is derived from a dynamic programming approach that considers the remaining cells after the moves and computes a value modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
