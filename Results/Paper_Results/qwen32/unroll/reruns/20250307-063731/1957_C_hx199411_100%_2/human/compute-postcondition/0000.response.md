Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`. Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ `r_i`, `c_i` ≤ `n`. It is guaranteed that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. The `k` moves and the implied computer moves are valid.**

In natural language: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of an integer input by the user, which is between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
