You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. The k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        num = 0
        
        for i in range(k):
            c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
            if c == r:
                num += 1
            else:
                num += 2
        
        m = n - num
        
        if m == 0:
            print(1)
        elif m == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]
            dp[1] = 1
            dp[2] = 3
            for i in range(3, m + 1):
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
            print(dp[m])
        
    #State: A list of `t` integers, where each integer is the result of the corresponding test case computed by the provided code.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the size of the grid and an integer `k` representing the number of moves. It also receives `k` pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)` representing the moves made on the grid. The function returns the result of each test case, which is not specified in detail here, but it implies some computation based on the grid size and the moves made.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
