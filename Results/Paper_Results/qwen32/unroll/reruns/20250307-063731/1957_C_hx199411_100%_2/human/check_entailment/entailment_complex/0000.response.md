### Reasoning:

The problem involves determining the number of different final configurations of a chessboard after a certain number of moves, considering the rules for placing rooks. The provided program calculates the number of valid configurations using dynamic programming (DP).

Here's a breakdown of the logic in the program:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already made.
   - It then reads the positions of the `k` moves.

2. **Counting Moves:**
   - The program counts the number of moves `num` that are either on the diagonal (where `c == r`) or not (where `c != r`).
   - Moves on the diagonal do not result in a mirrored move by the computer.
   - Moves not on the diagonal result in a mirrored move by the computer, effectively using up two positions on the board.

3. **Calculating Remaining Positions:**
   - The remaining positions `m` on the board after accounting for the `k` moves and their implications are calculated as `m = n - num`.

4. **Dynamic Programming for Counting Configurations:**
   - If `m == 0` or `m == 1`, there is only one possible configuration.
   - For `m > 1`, the program uses a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to fill `i` positions on the board.
   - The base cases are `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The DP transition is defined as `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`. This formula considers placing a rook in one position and then placing the remaining rooks in the remaining positions, taking into account the mirroring rule.

5. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the value of `dp[m]` modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid configurations based on the given constraints and rules. The use of dynamic programming efficiently handles the computation for large values of `n` and `k`. The provided example outputs match the expected results, indicating that the program works correctly for the given test cases.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
