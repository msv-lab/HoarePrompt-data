### Reasoning:

The given problem requires calculating the number of different final configurations of a chessboard after a series of moves, considering the constraints of rook placements and the mirroring rule.

The program follows these steps:

1. **Input Parsing**: It reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard (`n`) and the number of moves already played (`k`).
2. **Counting Moves**: It processes each of the `k` moves to determine how many of them are self-mirroring (`c == r`) and how many are not. Self-mirroring moves do not affect the subsequent moves since the computer skips its turn.
3. **Remaining Cells Calculation**: It calculates the number of remaining cells (`m`) that can still be used for future moves. This is done by subtracting the number of moves (`num`) from `n`.
4. **Dynamic Programming**: It uses a dynamic programming (DP) approach to calculate the number of possible configurations for the remaining `m` cells. The DP array `dp` is initialized with base cases, and then iteratively filled using the relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. This formula considers the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining cells, taking into account the mirroring rule.
5. **Output**: For each test case, it prints the number of configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and the provided example. The dynamic programming approach correctly calculates the number of configurations for the remaining cells after accounting for the moves and their implications.

### Correctness: **True**
