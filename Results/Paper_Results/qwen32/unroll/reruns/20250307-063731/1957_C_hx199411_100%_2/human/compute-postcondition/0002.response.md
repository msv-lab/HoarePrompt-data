To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand how the code processes each test case. The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the code performs the following steps:

1. **Input Parsing**: Read integers `n` and `k`.
2. **Counting Moves**: For each of the `k` moves, read integers `r_i` and `c_i`. If `r_i` equals `c_i`, increment `num` by 1 (diagonal move). Otherwise, increment `num` by 2 (non-diagonal move).
3. **Calculate Remaining Moves**: Compute `m` as `n - num`.
4. **Special Cases**: If `m` is 0 or 1, print `1` and move to the next test case.
5. **Dynamic Programming**: If `m` is greater than 1, compute the number of ways to arrange `m` non-diagonal moves using dynamic programming. The formula used is:
   - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
   - Initialize `dp[1]` to 1 and `dp[2]` to 3.
6. **Output**: Print `dp[m]`.

The output state after all iterations is the series of outputs for each test case, printed one per line. Since `t` is the number of test cases, the output will be a list of `t` values, each corresponding to the result of a test case.

Given the format requirement, we can't directly compute the output state without specific input values. However, we can describe the output state in a general form:

Output State: **A list of `t` integers, where each integer is the result of the corresponding test case computed by the provided code.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing all the test cases, the output will be a sequence of numbers, one for each test case, printed in the order the test cases were processed. Each number represents the number of ways to arrange the remaining non-diagonal moves after accounting for the moves specified in the input for that test case.
