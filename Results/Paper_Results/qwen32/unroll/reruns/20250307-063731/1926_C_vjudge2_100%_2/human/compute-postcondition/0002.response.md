Let's analyze the given loop and determine the output state step-by-step.

The initial state provided is:
- `num` is a list of integers, but the loop code seems to treat `num` as a single integer because it performs operations like `num % 10` and `int(num / 10)`.
- `a` is initialized to 0.

The loop code is:
```python
while num != 0:
    a = a + num % 10
    num = int(num / 10)
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as `num` is not zero. In each iteration:
- `a` is incremented by the last digit of `num` (obtained by `num % 10`).
- `num` is updated to be the integer part of `num` divided by 10 (obtained by `int(num / 10)`), effectively removing the last digit of `num`.

This process will continue until all digits of `num` have been processed, at which point `num` will be 0 and the loop will terminate.

The final value of `a` will be the sum of all the digits of the original integer `num`.

However, there is a discrepancy in the initial state description and the loop code. The initial state mentions `num` as a list of integers, but the loop code treats `num` as a single integer. To align with the loop code, we will assume `num` is a single integer.

Since the problem statement does not specify the exact value of `num`, let's assume `num` is a single integer `N` for the purpose of explanation.

After the loop completes:
- `num` will be 0.
- `a` will be the sum of the digits of the original integer `N`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `N`, we can't compute the exact final value of `a`. However, we can describe the output state in a general form.

Output State: **`num` is 0 and `a` is the sum of the digits of the original integer `num`.**

If we hypothetically consider `num` to be a specific integer, say 12345, then after the loop:
- `num` would be 0.
- `a` would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.

For the sake of a concrete example, let's assume `num` was 12345 initially:
Output State: **`num` is 0 and `a` is 15.**

However, without a specific initial value for `num`, the generalized output state is:
Output State: **`num` is 0 and `a` is the sum of the digits of the original integer `num`.**
