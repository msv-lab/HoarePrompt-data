Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it calculates the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to 200,000 and stores these cumulative sums in the list `A`. However, it does not correctly handle the individual test cases. Specifically, it assumes that the input `n` will never exceed 200,000, which is correct, but it does not reset the sum calculation for each test case. Instead, it simply prints the precomputed cumulative sum for the given `n`, which is incorrect for the problem's requirements.

The program should compute the sum of the digit sums for each test case individually, based on the input `n`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(num):
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        num = int(num / 10)
    return a

for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        total_sum += func_1(i)
    print(total_sum)
```

This version correctly computes the sum of the digit sums for each test case independently.
