### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to solve the problem by precomputing the sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and storing these cumulative sums in an array `A`. For each test case, it then simply looks up the precomputed result in this array.

1. **Precomputation**:
   - The program iterates from 1 to 200,000.
   - For each number `i`, it computes the sum of its digits using the function `func_1`.
   - It adds this digit sum to a running total `sum` and appends this total to the list `A`.
   - By the end of this loop, `A[i-1]` contains the sum of the digit sums of all numbers from 1 to `i`.

2. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, the program reads an integer `n`.
   - It then prints `A[n-1]`, which is the precomputed sum of the digit sums of all numbers from 1 to `n`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes an integer `num` and computes the sum of its digits.
   - It does this by repeatedly taking the last digit of `num` using `num % 10`, adding it to a running total `a`, and then removing the last digit from `num` using integer division `num = int(num / 10)`.
   - The function correctly returns the sum of the digits of `num`.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The precomputation step ensures that for any `n` up to 200,000, the sum of the digit sums from 1 to `n` is readily available in the array `A`.
   - The program handles up to 10,000 test cases efficiently by simply looking up the precomputed results.
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of any given number.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution states. It efficiently handles the constraints and produces the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
