Reasoning:  
The provided execution summary indicates a significant issue with the `func_1` function, which is supposed to calculate the sum of the digits of a given number. However, according to the summary, `func_1` always returns 0 regardless of the input value. This means that the program does not correctly compute the sum of digits for any number, and consequently, the sums calculated in the list `A` are all incorrect. As a result, the program will not produce the correct output for any test case.

Correctness: **False**
