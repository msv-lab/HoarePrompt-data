The given code snippet initializes the variable `a` to 0. This does not affect the list `num` or any other variables that might be present in the initial state. The only change is the assignment of the value 0 to `a`.

Output State: **`num` is a list of integers where each integer n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the length of `num` is between 1 and 10^4, inclusive; `a` is 0**.
