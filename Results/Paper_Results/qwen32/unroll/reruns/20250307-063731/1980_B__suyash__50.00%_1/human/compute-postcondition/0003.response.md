Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts integers `n`, `f`, and `k` where `1 <= f, k <= n <= 100`, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= 100`. The function processes these inputs for each test case and returns a result based on the given constraints.**
