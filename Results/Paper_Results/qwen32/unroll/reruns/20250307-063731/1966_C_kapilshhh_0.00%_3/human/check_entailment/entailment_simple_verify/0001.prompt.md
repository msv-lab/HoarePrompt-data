You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

Output

    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

        for i in range(1, len(arr)):

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap
The problem involves a game where Alice and Bob take turns removing stones from piles. The player who cannot make a move loses. The key is to determine the winner assuming both play optimally.

### Key Observations
1. **Game Analysis**: The game can be analyzed using the concept of Nim-sum (XOR-sum) from combinatorial game theory. The game is equivalent to a Nim game where each pile's size contributes to the Nim-sum. If the Nim-sum is zero at the start, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.
2. **Simplified Approach**: Since the game rules simplify to checking if the number of distinct pile sizes (after removing duplicates) is odd or even, the approach taken in the program seems to be a simplified heuristic. If the number of distinct pile sizes is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the provided program:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of piles and the sizes of the piles.
2. **Processing Input**: The program converts the pile sizes to a set to remove duplicates, sorts them in descending order, and appends a zero at the end.
3. **Determining Winner**: The program uses a dynamic programming-like approach to determine if the number of distinct pile sizes (after removing duplicates) is odd or even. The variable `dp` is used to toggle between True and False based on the differences between consecutive pile sizes.
4. **Output**: The program prints "Alice" if `dp` is True, otherwise "Bob". However, there seems to be a mistake in the print statement where both cases print "Alice".

### Mistake in the Program
The critical mistake in the program is the incorrect print statement:
```python
print('Alice' if dp else 'Alice')
```
This line should be:
```python
print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
```

### Conclusion
The logic of the program seems correct in terms of determining the winner based on the number of distinct pile sizes, but the print statement contains a mistake. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it stands.

Correctness: **False**
