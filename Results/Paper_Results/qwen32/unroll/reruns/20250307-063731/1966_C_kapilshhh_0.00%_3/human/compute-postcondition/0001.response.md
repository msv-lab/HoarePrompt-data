To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the state such that the condition `tc > 0` is satisfied. The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust `tc`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `tc` is an input integer

The condition for the loop to execute is `tc > 0`. Therefore, `tc` must be greater than 0.

State right before the while loop: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `tc` is an input integer.

To ensure the loop executes:
- `tc` must be greater than 0.

Since `tc` is an input integer, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `tc` must be a value greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `tc` must be greater than 0**
