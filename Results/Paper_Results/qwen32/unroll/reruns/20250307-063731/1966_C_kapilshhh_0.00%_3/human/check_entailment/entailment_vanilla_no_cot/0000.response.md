Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains a logical error in the final print statement. The program is supposed to print "Alice" if `dp` is `True` and "Bob" if `dp` is `False`, but it mistakenly prints "Alice" regardless of the value of `dp`. Here is the corrected print statement:

```python
print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
```

This change will ensure that the program outputs the correct winner based on the value of `dp`.
