Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `tc` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `tc` is assigned the value of an integer input, representing the number of test cases. The other variables (`n` and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) remain unchanged as they have not been affected by the executed code.
