### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring is the length of that substring.

The program consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1`**: This function reads a binary string and calculates the minimum cost to sort it.
2. **`func_2`**: This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

Let's analyze the logic of `func_1`:

- **Initialization**: `n` is initialized to 0 to count the number of '1's encountered, and `ans` is initialized to 0 to accumulate the total cost.
- **Loop through the string**: For each character in the string:
  - If the character is '1', increment `n` (count the '1's).
  - If the character is '0' and `n` is not 0 (meaning there have been '1's before this '0'), add `n + 1` to `ans`. The `n + 1` represents the cost of shifting the substring that includes the current '0' and all preceding '1's to the right of the '0'.
- **Output**: The accumulated cost `ans` is printed.

The logic seems to be based on the observation that each '0' following one or more '1's needs to be shifted to the right of all those '1's, and the cost is the length of the substring involved in each shift.

Let's verify this with the provided examples:
1. **Input**: `10`
   - `n` becomes 1 (first '1').
   - `ans` becomes 2 (encountered '0' after '1', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`).
   - **Output**: `2`.

2. **Input**: `0000`
   - No '1's, so `ans` remains 0.
   - **Output**: `0`.

3. **Input**: `11000`
   - `n` becomes 2 (first two '1's).
   - `ans` becomes 3 (first '0', cost is `2 + 1 = 3`).
   - `ans` becomes 6 (second '0', cost is `2 + 1 = 3`).
   - `ans` becomes 9 (third '0', cost is `2 + 1 = 3`).
   - **Output**: `9`.

4. **Input**: `101011`
   - `n` becomes 1 (first '1').
   - `ans` becomes 2 (first '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`).
   - `n` becomes 2 (second '1').
   - `ans` becomes 5 (second '0', cost is `2 + 1 = 3`).
   - `n` becomes 4 (last two '1's).
   - **Output**: `5`.

5. **Input**: `01101001`
   - `n` becomes 1 (first '1').
   - `ans` becomes 2 (first '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`).
   - `n` becomes 2 (second '1').
   - `ans` becomes 5 (second '0', cost is `2 + 1 = 3`).
   - `n` becomes 3 (third '1').
   - `ans` becomes 9 (third '0', cost is `3 + 1 = 4`).
   - `n` becomes 4 (fourth '1').
   - `ans` becomes 11 (fourth '0', cost is `4 + 1 = 5`).
   - **Output**: `11`.

The logic in `func_1` correctly computes the minimum cost for each test case based on the problem description. Since `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each case, the entire program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
