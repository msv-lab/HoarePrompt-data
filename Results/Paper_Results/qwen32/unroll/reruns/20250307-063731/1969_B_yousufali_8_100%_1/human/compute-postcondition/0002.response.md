To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given loop and its effect on the state variables. The provided loop is:

```python
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()
```

In this loop, `t` is an input integer that determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. The function `func_1()` is called in each iteration of the loop. However, the function `func_1()` is not defined in the provided code snippet, so we can only infer the output state based on the information given.

The loop iterates `t` times, and during each iteration, `func_1()` is executed. Since the function `func_1()` is not defined, we can only assume that it performs some operations that might affect its internal state or the global state if it modifies any global variables. However, the problem statement specifies that we should only consider changes to the variables in the loop head and body, and the state of other variables should remain unchanged.

Since the loop head variable `_` is a throwaway variable (it is not used within the loop body), its value does not affect the output state. The variable `t` is the loop control variable and is not modified within the loop, so its value remains the same.

Thus, the only change that can be observed is the number of times `func_1()` is executed, which is `t` times. However, since `func_1()` is not defined, we cannot determine any specific changes to other variables or the program state that it might cause.

Given these points, the output state will only reflect the unchanged value of `t`. Therefore, the output state, in terms of the given format, is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer.**
