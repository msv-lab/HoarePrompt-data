### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring is the length of that substring.

The provided code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function reads a binary string, counts the number of '1's encountered, and calculates the accumulated sum of (count of '1's + 1) each time a '0' is encountered after one or more '1's. It then prints this accumulated sum.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it calls `func_1()`.

Let's analyze if `func_1()` correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string:

- **Logic of `func_1()`**:
  - It initializes `n` to 0 (to count the number of '1's) and `ans` to 0 (to accumulate the total cost).
  - It iterates through each character in the string.
  - If it encounters a '1', it increments `n` by 1.
  - If it encounters a '0' and `n` is not 0 (i.e., there have been '1's before this '0'), it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
  - The cost `n + 1` is added because it takes `n + 1` operations to move all the preceding '1's to the right of the current '0'.

- **Correctness of the Logic**:
  - The logic correctly captures the essence of the problem. Each time a '0' is encountered after one or more '1's, it signifies a transition from '1's to '0's, which can be thought of as a series of cyclic shifts.
  - The cost `n + 1` is a valid way to account for the number of operations needed to bring all the '1's before the current '0' to the right of it.

- **Edge Cases Considered**:
  - If the string is already sorted (all '0's followed by all '1's), `ans` remains 0, which is correct.
  - If the string starts with '1's and ends with '0's, the logic correctly calculates the cost for each transition.

- **Execution Summary**:
  - The execution summary of `func_1()` aligns with the problem's requirement, indicating that the function correctly computes the minimum cost for each test case.
  - `func_2()` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each one.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions together correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
