You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and '1's), and n is initialized to 0 and ans is initialized to 0. The function iterates over each character in s, updating n and ans based on the conditions specified within the loop.
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: s is the input binary string, n is the total count of '1's in s, ans is the accumulated sum of (n + 1) for each '0' encountered after one or more '1's.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the accumulated sum of (n + 1) for each '0' encountered after one or more '1's in the binary string `s`)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a binary string from the input, counts the number of '1's encountered, and calculates the accumulated sum of (count of '1's + 1) each time a '0' is encountered after one or more '1's. It then prints this accumulated sum.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_2`.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user, then calls `func_1` a total of `t` times. The function does not return any value but performs actions based on the logic defined within `func_1`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to sort a binary string `s` in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
- Each cyclic shift on a substring `s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r` has a cost of `r - l + 1`.
- We need to find the minimum total cost to sort the string.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function processes a single binary string and calculates the minimum cost to sort it.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

Let's break down `func_1()`:
- It initializes `n` to 0 and `ans` to 0.
- It iterates over each character in the string `s`.
- If the character is '1', it increments `n`.
- If the character is '0' and `n` is not 0, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.

### Logic Analysis:
The logic of the program seems to be based on the observation that:
- Every '1' encountered before a '0' needs to be shifted to the right of that '0'.
- The cost of shifting `n` '1's to the right of a '0' is `n + 1`.

### Correctness Verification:
To verify the correctness, we need to check if this logic works for all possible binary strings.

#### Example Verification:
Let's verify the example cases given in the problem description:

1. **Test Case 1**: `s = "10"`
   - `n = 0`, `ans = 0`
   - `i = 0`: `s[0] = '1'`, `n = 1`
   - `i = 1`: `s[1] = '0'`, `n = 1`, `ans = 1 + 1 = 2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2**: `s = "0000"`
   - `n = 0`, `ans = 0`
   - No '1's, so `ans` remains 0.
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**: `s = "11000"`
   - `n = 0`, `ans = 0`
   - `i = 0`: `s[0] = '1'`, `n = 1`
   - `i = 1`: `s[1] = '1'`, `n = 2`
   - `i = 2`: `s[2] = '0'`, `n = 2`, `ans = 2 + 1 = 3`
   - `i = 3`: `s[3] = '0'`, `n = 2`, `ans = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6`
   - `i = 4`: `s[4] = '0'`, `n = 2`, `ans = 6 + 2 + 1 = 9`
   - Output: `9` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4**: `s = "101011"`
   - `n = 0`, `ans = 0`
   - `i = 0`: `s[0] = '1'`, `n = 1`
   - `i = 1`: `s[1] = '0'`, `n = 1`, `ans = 1 + 1 = 2`
   - `i = 2`: `s[2] = '1'`, `n = 2`
   - `i = 3`: `s[3] = '0'`, `n = 2`, `ans = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5`
   - `i = 4`: `s[4] = '1'`, `n = 3`
   - `i = 5`: `s[5] = '1'`, `n = 4`
   - Output: `5` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5**: `s = "01101001"`
   - `n = 0`, `ans = 0`
   - `i = 0`: `s[0] = '0'`, `n = 0`
   - `i = 1`: `s[1] = '1'`, `n = 1`
   - `i = 2`: `s[2] = '1'`, `n = 2`
   - `i = 3`: `s[3] = '0'`, `n = 2`, `ans = 2 + 1 = 3`
   - `i = 4`: `s[4] = '1'`, `n = 3`
   - `i = 5`: `s[5] = '0'`, `n = 3`, `ans = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7`
   - `i = 6`: `s[6] = '0'`, `n = 3`, `ans = 7 + 3 + 1 = 11`
   - `i = 7`: `s[7] = '1'`, `n = 4`
   - Output: `11` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The provided program seems to correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order for all the given examples and the logic appears to be sound.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost to sort a binary string by considering the number of '1's encountered before each '0' and adding the appropriate cost for each shift. The examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program.
