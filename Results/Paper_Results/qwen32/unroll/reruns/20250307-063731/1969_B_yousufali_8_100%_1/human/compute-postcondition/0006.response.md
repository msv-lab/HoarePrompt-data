Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It processes a binary string `s` (consisting of only '0's and '1's) and two initialized integer variables `n` and `ans`. Based on the characters in `s`, it updates `n` and `ans` within a loop. The function returns the final value of `ans`.**
