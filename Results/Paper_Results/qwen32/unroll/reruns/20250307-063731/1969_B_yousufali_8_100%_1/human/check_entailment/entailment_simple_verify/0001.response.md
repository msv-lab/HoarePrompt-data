### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated version to ensure that the logic aligns with the problem description and the example given.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Objective**: Sort a binary string in non-descending order (all '0's before all '1's) with the minimum total cost.
- **Cost**: The cost of cyclically shifting a substring of length `k` is `k`.
- **Strategy**: Each '0' that appears after one or more '1's needs to be shifted to the left of those '1's, and the cost of such a shift is the number of '1's seen so far plus one.

#### Program Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - **Variables**:
    - `n`: Counts the number of '1's encountered so far.
    - `ans`: Accumulates the total cost.
  - **Loop Logic**:
    - If the current character is '1', increment `n`.
    - If the current character is '0' and `n` is not zero (indicating that there are '1's before this '0'), add `n + 1` to `ans`.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - Handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

#### Verification with Example:
- **Input**: "11000"
- **Execution**:
  - `i=0`, `s[i]='1'`, `n=1`, `ans=0`
  - `i=1`, `s[i]='1'`, `n=2`, `ans=0`
  - `i=2`, `s[i]='0'`, `n=2`, `ans=3` (since `n+1=3`)
  - `i=3`, `s[i]='0'`, `n=2`, `ans=6` (since `n+1=3`)
  - `i=4`, `s[i]='0'`, `n=2`, `ans=9` (since `n+1=3`)
- **Output**: `9`

This matches the expected output for the third test case.

#### Additional Verification:
Let's consider another example to ensure the logic is robust:
- **Input**: "101011"
- **Execution**:
  - `i=0`, `s[i]='1'`, `n=1`, `ans=0`
  - `i=1`, `s[i]='0'`, `n=1`, `ans=2` (since `n+1=2`)
  - `i=2`, `s[i]='1'`, `n=2`, `ans=2`
  - `i=3`, `s[i]='0'`, `n=2`, `ans=5` (since `n+1=3`)
  - `i=4`, `s[i]='1'`, `n=3`, `ans=5`
  - `i=5`, `s[i]='1'`, `n=4`, `ans=5`
- **Output**: `5`

This output matches the expected output for the fourth test case.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string using the described cyclic shift operations. The logic in `func_1` correctly accumulates the cost based on the number of '1's encountered before each '0'. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
