In the provided for loop, the loop head contains the variable `_` and the integer `t`. The loop will execute `t` times. The variable `_` is a conventional name for a loop variable that we do not intend to use within the loop body, and `t` is the input integer that determines the number of iterations.

To ensure that the loop executes, the only variable we can adjust is `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop will execute. The variable `_` does not need to be adjusted because it is not used within the loop body and does not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
