Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to sort a binary string `s` in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
- Each cyclic shift on a substring `s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r` has a cost of `r - l + 1`.
- We need to find the minimum total cost to sort the string.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function processes a single binary string and calculates the minimum cost to sort it.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

Let's break down `func_1()`:
- It initializes `n` to 0 and `ans` to 0.
- It iterates over each character in the string `s`.
- If the character is '1', it increments `n`.
- If the character is '0' and `n` is not 0, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.

### Logic Analysis:
The logic of the program seems to be based on the observation that:
- Every '1' encountered before a '0' needs to be shifted to the right of that '0'.
- The cost of shifting `n` '1's to the right of a '0' is `n + 1`.

### Correctness Verification:
To verify the correctness, we need to check if this logic works for all possible binary strings.

#### Example Verification:
Let's verify the example cases given in the problem description:

1. **Test Case 1**: `s = "10"`
   - `n = 0`, `ans = 0`
   - `i = 0`: `s[0] = '1'`, `n = 1`
   - `i = 1`: `s[1] = '0'`, `n = 1`, `ans = 1 + 1 = 2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2**: `s = "0000"`
   - `n = 0`, `ans = 0`
   - No '1's, so `ans` remains 0.
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**: `s = "11000"`
   - `n = 0`, `ans = 0`
   - `i = 0`: `s[0] = '1'`, `n = 1`
   - `i = 1`: `s[1] = '1'`, `n = 2`
   - `i = 2`: `s[2] = '0'`, `n = 2`, `ans = 2 + 1 = 3`
   - `i = 3`: `s[3] = '0'`, `n = 2`, `ans = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6`
   - `i = 4`: `s[4] = '0'`, `n = 2`, `ans = 6 + 2 + 1 = 9`
   - Output: `9` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4**: `s = "101011"`
   - `n = 0`, `ans = 0`
   - `i = 0`: `s[0] = '1'`, `n = 1`
   - `i = 1`: `s[1] = '0'`, `n = 1`, `ans = 1 + 1 = 2`
   - `i = 2`: `s[2] = '1'`, `n = 2`
   - `i = 3`: `s[3] = '0'`, `n = 2`, `ans = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5`
   - `i = 4`: `s[4] = '1'`, `n = 3`
   - `i = 5`: `s[5] = '1'`, `n = 4`
   - Output: `5` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5**: `s = "01101001"`
   - `n = 0`, `ans = 0`
   - `i = 0`: `s[0] = '0'`, `n = 0`
   - `i = 1`: `s[1] = '1'`, `n = 1`
   - `i = 2`: `s[2] = '1'`, `n = 2`
   - `i = 3`: `s[3] = '0'`, `n = 2`, `ans = 2 + 1 = 3`
   - `i = 4`: `s[4] = '1'`, `n = 3`
   - `i = 5`: `s[5] = '0'`, `n = 3`, `ans = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7`
   - `i = 6`: `s[6] = '0'`, `n = 3`, `ans = 7 + 3 + 1 = 11`
   - `i = 7`: `s[7] = '1'`, `n = 4`
   - Output: `11` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The provided program seems to correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order for all the given examples and the logic appears to be sound.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost to sort a binary string by considering the number of '1's encountered before each '0' and adding the appropriate cost for each shift. The examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program.
