To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's break down the problem and analyze the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's should come before all '1's) using the minimum total cost. The cost is defined as the length of the substring being cyclically shifted.

### Key Observations

1. **Cyclic Shift Effect**: A cyclic shift of a substring can only change the relative order of its elements. For example, shifting "101" cyclically results in "110" or "011", but the number of '0's and '1's remains the same.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost of shifting a substring of length `k` is `k`. To minimize the total cost, we should aim to perform the fewest possible shifts with the highest possible costs.

3. **Sorting Strategy**: To sort the binary string, we need to move all '0's to the left and all '1's to the right. The optimal strategy involves shifting substrings that contain both '0's and '1's.

### Provided Program Analysis

Let's analyze the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2`.

#### Function `func_1`

```python
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)
```

- **Variable `n`**: Counts the number of '1's encountered so far.
- **Variable `ans`**: Accumulates the total cost.
- **Loop Logic**:
  - If the current character is '1', increment `n`.
  - If the current character is '0' and `n` is not zero (indicating that there are '1's before this '0'), add `n + 1` to `ans`.

#### Function `func_2`

```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
```

- This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Reasoning for Correctness

The logic in `func_1` is based on the idea that each '0' that appears after one or more '1's represents a necessary shift to move that '0' to the left of the '1's. The cost of each such shift is the number of '1's seen so far plus one (the length of the substring to be shifted).

Let's verify this with the example provided:

- **Input**: "11000"
- **Execution**:
  - `i=0`, `s[i]='1'`, `n=1`, `ans=0`
  - `i=1`, `s[i]='1'`, `n=2`, `ans=0`
  - `i=2`, `s[i]='0'`, `n=2`, `ans=3` (since `n+1=3`)
  - `i=3`, `s[i]='0'`, `n=2`, `ans=6` (since `n+1=3`)
  - `i=4`, `s[i]='0'`, `n=2`, `ans=9` (since `n+1=3`)
- **Output**: `9`

This matches the expected output for the third test case.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string using the described cyclic shift operations. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
