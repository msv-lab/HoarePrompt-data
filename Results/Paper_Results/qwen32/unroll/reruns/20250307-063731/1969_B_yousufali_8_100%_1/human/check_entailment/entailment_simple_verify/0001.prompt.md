You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's break down the problem and analyze the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's should come before all '1's) using the minimum total cost. The cost is defined as the length of the substring being cyclically shifted.

### Key Observations

1. **Cyclic Shift Effect**: A cyclic shift of a substring can only change the relative order of its elements. For example, shifting "101" cyclically results in "110" or "011", but the number of '0's and '1's remains the same.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost of shifting a substring of length `k` is `k`. To minimize the total cost, we should aim to perform the fewest possible shifts with the highest possible costs.

3. **Sorting Strategy**: To sort the binary string, we need to move all '0's to the left and all '1's to the right. The optimal strategy involves shifting substrings that contain both '0's and '1's.

### Provided Program Analysis

Let's analyze the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2`.

#### Function `func_1`

```python
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)
```

- **Variable `n`**: Counts the number of '1's encountered so far.
- **Variable `ans`**: Accumulates the total cost.
- **Loop Logic**:
  - If the current character is '1', increment `n`.
  - If the current character is '0' and `n` is not zero (indicating that there are '1's before this '0'), add `n + 1` to `ans`.

#### Function `func_2`

```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
```

- This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Reasoning for Correctness

The logic in `func_1` is based on the idea that each '0' that appears after one or more '1's represents a necessary shift to move that '0' to the left of the '1's. The cost of each such shift is the number of '1's seen so far plus one (the length of the substring to be shifted).

Let's verify this with the example provided:

- **Input**: "11000"
- **Execution**:
  - `i=0`, `s[i]='1'`, `n=1`, `ans=0`
  - `i=1`, `s[i]='1'`, `n=2`, `ans=0`
  - `i=2`, `s[i]='0'`, `n=2`, `ans=3` (since `n+1=3`)
  - `i=3`, `s[i]='0'`, `n=2`, `ans=6` (since `n+1=3`)
  - `i=4`, `s[i]='0'`, `n=2`, `ans=9` (since `n+1=3`)
- **Output**: `9`

This matches the expected output for the third test case.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string using the described cyclic shift operations. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
