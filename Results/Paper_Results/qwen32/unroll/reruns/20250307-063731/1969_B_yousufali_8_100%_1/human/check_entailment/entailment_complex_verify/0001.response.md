Let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the provided program using the problem description, the program code, and the annotated version of the code.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order (all '0's before all '1's) with the minimum total cost, where the cost is defined as the length of the substring being cyclically shifted.

### Key Observations

1. **Cyclic Shift Effect**: Cyclically shifting a substring only changes the relative order of its elements but not the count of '0's and '1's.
2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost of shifting a substring of length `k` is `k`. To minimize the total cost, we should aim to perform the fewest possible shifts with the highest possible costs.
3. **Sorting Strategy**: To sort the binary string, we need to move all '0's to the left and all '1's to the right. The optimal strategy involves shifting substrings that contain both '0's and '1's.

### Provided Program Analysis

#### Function `func_1`

```python
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)
```

- **Variable `n`**: Counts the number of '1's encountered so far.
- **Variable `ans`**: Accumulates the total cost.
- **Loop Logic**:
  - If the current character is '1', increment `n`.
  - If the current character is '0' and `n` is not zero (indicating that there are '1's before this '0'), add `n + 1` to `ans`.

#### Function `func_2`

```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
```

- This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Reasoning for Correctness

The logic in `func_1` is based on the idea that each '0' that appears after one or more '1's represents a necessary shift to move that '0' to the left of the '1's. The cost of each such shift is the number of '1's seen so far plus one (the length of the substring to be shifted).

Let's verify this with the example provided:

- **Input**: "11000"
- **Execution**:
  - `i=0`, `s[i]='1'`, `n=1`, `ans=0`
  - `i=1`, `s[i]='1'`, `n=2`, `ans=0`
  - `i=2`, `s[i]='0'`, `n=2`, `ans=3` (since `n+1=3`)
  - `i=3`, `s[i]='0'`, `n=2`, `ans=6` (since `n+1=3`)
  - `i=4`, `s[i]='0'`, `n=2`, `ans=9` (since `n+1=3`)
- **Output**: `9`

This matches the expected output for the third test case.

### Additional Test Cases

Let's consider a few more test cases to ensure the logic holds:

1. **Input**: "10"
   - **Execution**:
     - `i=0`, `s[i]='1'`, `n=1`, `ans=0`
     - `i=1`, `s[i]='0'`, `n=1`, `ans=2` (since `n+1=2`)
   - **Output**: `2` (matches expected output)

2. **Input**: "0000"
   - **Execution**:
     - No '1's, so `ans` remains `0`.
   - **Output**: `0` (matches expected output)

3. **Input**: "101011"
   - **Execution**:
     - `i=0`, `s[i]='1'`, `n=1`, `ans=0`
     - `i=1`, `s[i]='0'`, `n=1`, `ans=2` (since `n+1=2`)
     - `i=2`, `s[i]='1'`, `n=2`, `ans=2`
     - `i=3`, `s[i]='0'`, `n=2`, `ans=5` (since `n+1=3`)
     - `i=4`, `s[i]='1'`, `n=3`, `ans=5`
     - `i=5`, `s[i]='1'`, `n=4`, `ans=5`
   - **Output**: `5` (matches expected output)

4. **Input**: "01101001"
   - **Execution**:
     - `i=0`, `s[i]='0'`, `n=0`, `ans=0`
     - `i=1`, `s[i]='1'`, `n=1`, `ans=0`
     - `i=2`, `s[i]='1'`, `n=2`, `ans=0`
     - `i=3`, `s[i]='0'`, `n=2`, `ans=3` (since `n+1=3`)
     - `i=4`, `s[i]='1'`, `n=3`, `ans=3`
     - `i=5`, `s[i]='0'`, `n=3`, `ans=7` (since `n+1=4`)
     - `i=6`, `s[i]='0'`, `n=3`, `ans=11` (since `n+1=4`)
     - `i=7`, `s[i]='1'`, `n=4`, `ans=11`
   - **Output**: `11` (matches expected output)

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string using the described cyclic shift operations. The logic in `func_1` accurately captures the necessary shifts and their associated costs.
