Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; the trump suit is a single character from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}; the 2n cards are provided as a list of 2n unique two-character strings, where the first character is a rank from the set {'2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'} and the second character is a suit from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}; `trumps` is an empty list; `answers` is an empty list; `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values set to `None`.
Code of the loop:
for card in input().split():
    rank, suit = card
    if suit == trump:
        trumps.append(rank)
    elif suits[suit] is not None:
        answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit],
            rank])]))
        suits[suit] = None
    else:
        suits[suit] = rank


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
