The function processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of a number of cards and a trump suit. It pairs cards of the same suit and pairs remaining non-trump cards with the highest available trump cards. If there are not enough trump cards to pair with all non-trump cards, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE". Otherwise, it prints all pairs of cards.
