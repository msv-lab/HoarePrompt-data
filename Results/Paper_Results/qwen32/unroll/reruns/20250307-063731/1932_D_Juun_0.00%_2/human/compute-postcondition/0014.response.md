Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 16, and a trump suit which is a single character from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}. Additionally, it accepts a list of 2n unique two-character strings representing cards, where the first character is a rank from the set {'2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'} and the second character is a suit from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}. The function returns the total score based on the provided cards and the trump suit.**
