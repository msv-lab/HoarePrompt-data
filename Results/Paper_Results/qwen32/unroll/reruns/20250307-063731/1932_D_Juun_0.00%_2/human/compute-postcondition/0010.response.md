To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `trumps != []` evaluates to `True`. This means that the `trumps` list should not be empty.

Given the state right before the `while` loop:
- `trumps` is an empty list.
- `answers` contains strings representing pairs of non-trump cards with one card from the original `trumps` list.
- `suits` remains a dictionary with all values set to `None`.

The only variable in the loop head is `trumps`. Therefore, we need to adjust `trumps` to ensure it is not empty.

### Solution:
- Change `trumps` from an empty list to a list containing at least one element.

State: **`trumps` is a list containing at least one element, `answers` contains strings representing pairs of non-trump cards with one card from the original `trumps` list, and `suits` remains a dictionary with all values set to `None`.**
