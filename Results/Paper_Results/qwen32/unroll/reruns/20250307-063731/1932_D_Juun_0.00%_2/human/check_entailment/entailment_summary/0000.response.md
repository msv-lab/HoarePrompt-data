### Reasoning:
The program aims to reconstruct the rounds of a card game based on the provided shuffled discard pile and the trump suit. The approach taken by the program is to first separate the cards into trumps and non-trumps, then pair non-trump cards of the same suit, and finally pair any remaining non-trump cards with the highest available trump cards. If there are not enough trump cards to pair with all non-trump cards, the program correctly identifies this as an impossible scenario and prints "IMPOSSIBLE".

Let's break down the logic:
1. **Input Parsing:** The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of rounds, the trump suit, and the list of cards.
2. **Card Classification:** It separates the cards into trumps and non-trumps, storing the non-trump cards by their suits.
3. **Pairing Non-Trump Cards:** For each non-trump suit, it pairs the two cards in that suit.
4. **Pairing Remaining Non-Trump Cards with Trumps:** If there are any remaining non-trump cards, it attempts to pair them with the highest available trump cards.
5. **Handling Insufficient Trump Cards:** If there are not enough trump cards to pair with all remaining non-trump cards, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE".
6. **Output:** It prints the pairs of cards in the order they are determined.

The program handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement:
- It correctly identifies when it is impossible to pair all cards.
- It pairs cards according to the rules provided (same suit for non-trump cards, trump cards beating non-trump cards).
- It outputs any valid sequence of rounds.

### Correctness:
Based on the provided logic and execution summary, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality for reconstructing the rounds of the card game.

Correctness: **True**
