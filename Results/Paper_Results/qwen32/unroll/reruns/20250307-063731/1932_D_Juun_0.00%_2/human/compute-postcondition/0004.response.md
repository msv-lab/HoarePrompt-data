Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; the trump suit is a single character from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}; the 2n cards are provided as a list of 2n unique two-character strings, where the first character is a rank from the set {'2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'} and the second character is a suit from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}; `trumps` is an empty list; `answers` is an empty list; `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values set to `None`.**

In this output state, the variable `suits` has been initialized as a dictionary with keys representing the suits ('C', 'D', 'H', 'S') and all values set to `None`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, the trump suit, the list of cards, `trumps`, and `answers`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
