The provided code snippet only initializes an empty list `trumps`. No other variables are affected, and no calculations or changes are made to the existing variables `t`, `n`, the trump suit, or the list of cards. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `trumps` list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; the trump suit is a single character from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'} provided by the user input; the 2n cards are provided as a list of 2n unique two-character strings, where the first character is a rank from the set {'2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'} and the second character is a suit from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}; `trumps` is an empty list.**
