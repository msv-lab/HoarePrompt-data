Output State: **`trumps` is an empty list, `answers` contains strings representing pairs of non-trump cards with one card from the original `trumps` list, and `suits` remains a dictionary with all values set to `None`.**

Explanation: Since `trumps` is an empty list, sorting it does not change its contents. Therefore, `trumps` remains an empty list. The variables `answers` and `suits` are not affected by the sorting operation.
