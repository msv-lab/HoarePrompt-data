Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives four pairs of integers `(x_i, y_i)` representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The function returns the area of each square for the given test cases.**
