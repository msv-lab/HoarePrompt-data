Correctness: **False**

The provided program calculates the area of the square incorrectly. The program is attempting to calculate the area based on the product of the square roots of the squared distances between two pairs of adjacent points. However, this approach does not correctly compute the area of the square.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

1. Collect the coordinates of the four corners.
2. Sort the coordinates to identify the side length of the square.
3. Calculate the side length using the distance between two adjacent points.
4. Compute the area by squaring the side length.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        
        # Sort the coordinates to identify the side length
        coord.sort()
        
        # Calculate the side length using the distance between two adjacent points
        side_length = math.sqrt((coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2)
        
        # Calculate the area of the square
        area = int(side_length ** 2)
        
        print(area)
        n -= 1

# Example usage:
# func()
```

In this corrected version, the side length of the square is calculated correctly by taking the distance between two adjacent points, and then the area is calculated by squaring the side length. This should produce the correct output for the given problem.
