t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. coordinates is a list of lists, where each inner list contains 8 integers (x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4) representing the coordinates of the four corners of a square in random order. Each coordinate xi, yi satisfies -1000 <= xi, yi <= 1000. It is guaranteed that the given coordinates form a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
