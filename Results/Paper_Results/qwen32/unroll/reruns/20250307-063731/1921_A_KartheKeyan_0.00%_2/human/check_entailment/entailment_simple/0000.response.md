### Reasoning:

The program is intended to compute the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners. The program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads four coordinate pairs. It then calculates the area of the square by determining the side length and squaring it.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads four lines, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of the square.

2. **Sorting Coordinates**:
   - The coordinates are stored in a list and sorted. Sorting helps in easily identifying the sides of the square.

3. **Calculating Side Length**:
   - The program calculates the squared distance between two adjacent corners (which should be the same for all sides of the square). This is done using the distance formula: \((x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2\).
   - It computes the distance between the first two sorted points and the last two sorted points. These distances should be equal for the sides of the square.

4. **Calculating Area**:
   - The area of the square is calculated by taking the square root of the distance (which gives the side length) and squaring it. However, the program uses `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))` which is incorrect. The correct approach would be to take the square root of `p1` (or `p2`, since they should be equal) and square it.

5. **Output**:
   - The computed area is printed for each test case.

### Mistake in the Program:
The program calculates the area as `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`, which is incorrect. Since `p1` and `p2` should be the same (both representing the squared side length), the correct calculation should be `math.sqrt(p1) ** 2` or simply `p1` (since `p1` is already the squared side length).

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect due to the mistake in calculating the area.

**Correctness: False**
