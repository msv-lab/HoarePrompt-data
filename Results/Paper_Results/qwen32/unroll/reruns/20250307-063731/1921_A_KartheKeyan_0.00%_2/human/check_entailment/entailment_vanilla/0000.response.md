Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly calculates the area of the square based on the given problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners. The square is guaranteed to have sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and its area is strictly greater than 0.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of four lines of coordinates. The steps taken by the program are as follows:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases, `t`, is read.
   - For each test case, the program reads four lines of coordinates, each representing a corner of the square.

2. **Sorting Coordinates:**
   - The list of coordinates is sorted. This step is crucial for ensuring that the program can correctly identify adjacent corners of the square.

3. **Calculating Side Lengths:**
   - The program calculates the squared distance between the first two sorted coordinates (`p1`) and the last two sorted coordinates (`p2`).
   - The square root of these distances is taken to get the actual side lengths.
   - The area of the square is then calculated as the product of these side lengths.

### Issues in the Program
- **Incorrect Calculation of Area:**
  - The area of a square is the side length squared, not the product of two side lengths.
  - The program calculates the product of the side lengths (`math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)`), which is incorrect. It should be the square of one of the side lengths.

### Correct Approach
- After sorting the coordinates, the side length of the square can be calculated as the absolute difference in either the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of adjacent corners.
- The area of the square is then the square of this side length.

### Corrected Program
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        coord = sorted(coord)
        side_length = abs(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])  # or abs(coord[3][1] - coord[2][1])
        area = side_length ** 2
        print(area)
        n -= 1

func()
```

### Conclusion
The original program is incorrect due to the incorrect calculation of the area of the square. The correct approach should involve calculating the square of the side length.

Correctness: **False**
