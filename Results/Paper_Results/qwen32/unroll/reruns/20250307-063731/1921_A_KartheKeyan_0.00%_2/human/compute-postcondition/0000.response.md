The provided code snippet appears to have a mismatch between the initial state description and the code logic. The code is designed to read an integer `n` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads an integer `l` and computes a value `s` based on `l`. However, the initial state describes test cases with coordinates of the corners of a square, which are not used in the provided code.

Given the code snippet, here's the output state considering the provided logic:

Initial State: `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of four lines, with each line containing two integers `x_i, y_i` (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It is guaranteed that the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.

Code:
```python
n = int(input())
while n:
    l = int(input())
    s = 0
    s += (l // 4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2
    print(s)
    n -= 1
```

The code reads `n` test cases, and for each test case, it reads an integer `l`, computes `s` using the formula `(l // 4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2`, and prints `s`. The value of `n` is decremented after each test case.

Since the coordinates of the squares are not used in the code, we will focus on the changes to `n` and `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. `n` is 0. For each of the `t` test cases, an integer `l` was read, and `s` was computed and printed as `(l // 4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2`.**

In simpler terms, the number of test cases `t` remains the same, but `n` is now 0 because the loop has finished. For each test case, an integer `l` was read, and the value of `s` was calculated and printed based on the formula provided.
