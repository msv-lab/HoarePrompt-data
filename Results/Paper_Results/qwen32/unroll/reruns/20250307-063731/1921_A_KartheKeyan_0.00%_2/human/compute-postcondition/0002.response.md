The `while` loop in the given code is `while n:`. This loop will execute as long as `n` is a non-zero value. Therefore, to ensure that the first iteration of the loop can proceed, `n` must be a non-zero integer.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an input integer.
- For each of the `t` test cases, an integer `l` was read, and `s` was computed and printed as `(l // 4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2`.

The only variable in the loop head is `n`. To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be non-zero. Since the problem doesn't specify the initial value of `n`, we need to adjust the state so that `n` is non-zero.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a non-zero integer, for each of the `t` test cases, an integer `l` was read, and `s` was computed and printed as `(l // 4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2`**.
