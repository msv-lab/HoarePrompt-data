Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (representing the number of houses) and a string `a` of length `n` (consisting of 0s and 1s, where 0 indicates a preference for the left side and 1 indicates a preference for the right side). For each test case, the function returns the number of houses that have residents preferring to live on the left side (i.e., the count of 0s in the string `a`).**
