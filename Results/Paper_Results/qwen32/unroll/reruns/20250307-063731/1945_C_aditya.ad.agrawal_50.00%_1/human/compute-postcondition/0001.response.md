In this task, we need to ensure that the `while` loop can execute at least once. The loop condition is `while t:`, which means the loop will continue as long as `t` is non-zero.

Given the state right before the loop: `t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4.

Since `t` is already specified to be within the range 1 to 2·10^4, it means `t` is guaranteed to be a positive integer and, therefore, the loop condition `while t:` will be true, allowing the loop to execute at least once.

No adjustment to `t` is necessary because it is already within the range that ensures the loop will execute. Thus, the state remains the same.

State: **`t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4**
