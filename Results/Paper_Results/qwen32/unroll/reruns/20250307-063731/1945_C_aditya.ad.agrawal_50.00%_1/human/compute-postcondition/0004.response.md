Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` representing the number of houses and a string `a` of length `n` with characters '0' or '1'. For each test case, it determines and prints the position in the string `a` where the number of '0's and '1's on the left side of the position is as balanced as possible with the number of '0's and '1's on the right side.**
