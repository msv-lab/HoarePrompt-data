Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4. Each test case consists of an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string a of length n consisting only of 0s and 1s, where a_j = 0 if the resident of the j-th house wants to live on the left side of the street and a_j = 1 if they want to live on the right side. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    n = int(input())
    input_string = input()
    arr = [int(ch) for ch in input_string]
    z = arr.count(0)
    o = arr.count(1)
    z_r = z
    o_r = o
    z_l = 0
    o_l = 0
    dist, ans, pos = abs(n / 2), 0, 0
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2:
        b_d = dist
    else:
        b_d = 30001
    for i in arr:
        pos += 1
        if i == 0:
            z_l += 1
            z_r -= 1
        else:
            o_l += 1
            o_r -= 1
        if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(
            n / 2 - pos):
            ans = pos
            b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)
    print(ans)
    t -= 1



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
