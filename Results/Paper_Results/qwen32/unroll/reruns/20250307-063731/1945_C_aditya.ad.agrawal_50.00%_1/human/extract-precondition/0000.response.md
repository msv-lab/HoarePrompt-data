Precondition: **Each test case consists of an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string a of length n consisting only of 0s and 1s, where a_j = 0 if the resident of the j-th house wants to live on the left side of the street and a_j = 1 if they want to live on the right side. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.**
