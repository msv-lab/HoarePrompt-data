Output State: **`t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4. Each test case consists of an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string a of length n consisting only of 0s and 1s, where a_j = 0 if the resident of the j-th house wants to live on the left side of the street and a_j = 1 if they want to live on the right side. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.**

In simple terms, the variable `t` is now set to the number of test cases, which is an integer input by the user, and all other initial conditions remain unchanged.
