You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to maximize the score by repeatedly selecting pairs of integers from a list and adding the smaller of the two to the score. The optimal strategy is to always pair the smallest available numbers together. This way, we maximize the number of times we add smaller numbers to the score, leading to the highest possible score.

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the given program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which indicates that there are `2n` numbers in the list.
   - It then reads the `2n` numbers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes a score `s` to 0.
   - It reads the `2n` numbers, converts them to a list of integers, and sorts this list.
   - It then iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the first element of each pair (which is the smaller one due to sorting) to the score `s`.
   - The score `s` for each test case is appended to the `final` list.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the scores for each test case.

### Issues in the Program
There are a couple of issues in the given program:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling:**
   - The program reads `n` and then immediately reads two separate inputs `a` and `b`. However, the problem description specifies that there is only one line of input for the `2n` numbers. The correct approach is to read the entire line of numbers after reading `n`.

2. **Reading `n` Incorrectly:**
   - The variable `n` is read as a string and then used in a loop that expects an integer. This is not a problem in itself, but it is important to ensure that `n` is correctly interpreted as an integer when used in the loop.

### Corrected Input Reading
The corrected part of the code for reading inputs should look like this:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    final = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
        numbers.sort()
        score = sum(numbers[i] for i in range(0, 2*n, 2))
        final.append(score)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)
```

### Conclusion
The original program does not correctly handle the input format as specified in the problem statement. It incorrectly assumes that the `2n` numbers are provided in two separate inputs, which is not the case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
