The only variable in the loop head is `fin`, which is an element of the `final` list. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the `final` list must contain at least one element.

State: **`final` is a list containing the sum of every other element (starting from the first) of the sorted list of integers for each pair of inputs, and `final` must have at least one element.**
