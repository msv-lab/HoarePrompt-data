### Reasoning:

The program provided is intended to solve the problem by following these steps:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the number of pairs of integers on the whiteboard.
   - It then reads the `2n` integers which are the numbers written on the whiteboard.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes a score `s` to 0.
   - It reads the `2n` integers, splits them into a list, converts them to integers, and sorts the list in ascending order.
   - It then iterates through the sorted list, adding every other element (starting from the first) to the score `s`. This ensures that the smallest possible number from each pair is added to the score, maximizing the final score.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the score for each test case.

### Issues in the Provided Code:

- **Incorrect Input Handling:**
  - The code uses `input()` three times in a loop to read the input for each test case, which is incorrect. It should read the input for `n` and the list of integers in a single iteration of the loop.
  
- **Redundant Lists:**
  - The code uses two lists `list1` and `list2` where `list2` is a copy of `list1` after converting its elements to integers. This is unnecessary and can be simplified.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    final = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        s = sum(a[i] for i in range(0, len(a), 2))
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect due to improper input handling and unnecessary complexity in list management. The corrected version addresses these issues and correctly computes the maximum final score for each test case.

**Correctness: False**
