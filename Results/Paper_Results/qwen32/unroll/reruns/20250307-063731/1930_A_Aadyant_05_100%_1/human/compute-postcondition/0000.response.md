The code snippet provided only reads the first line of input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Given the initial state, `n` was not defined before, and it will now hold the value of the first line of input, which is a single integer representing the number of pairs of integers on the whiteboard.

The other parts of the initial state, including the second line of input and the total number of test cases `t`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a single integer read from the input, representing the number of pairs of integers on the whiteboard. The total number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 5000, and the second line of input contains 2n integers.**
