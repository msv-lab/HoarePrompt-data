### Reasoning:
The given Python program aims to solve the problem by following these steps:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   - It splits the input string into a list of integers and sorts this list.
   - It then sums every other element starting from the first element of the sorted list. This is because, in a sorted list, the smallest elements will be at the beginning, and summing every other element ensures that the smallest possible values are chosen in each pair, thereby maximizing the score.
3. **Output**: The program outputs the computed score for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Sorting**: Sorting the list ensures that the smallest elements are paired together, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the score.
- **Summing Every Other Element**: By summing every other element starting from the first, the program effectively pairs the smallest elements together, as required by the problem statement.
- **Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating through each one and storing the results in a list, which are then printed at the end.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the score by always pairing the smallest available numbers. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

### Your response:
Correctness: **True**
