The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `final`. This operation does not affect the value of `n` or any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the list `final`.

Output State: **`n` is a single integer read from the input, representing the number of pairs of integers on the whiteboard; `final` is an empty list.**
