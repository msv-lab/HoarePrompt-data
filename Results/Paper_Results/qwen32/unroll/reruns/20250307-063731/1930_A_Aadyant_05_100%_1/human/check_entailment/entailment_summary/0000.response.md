Reasoning:
The given program is designed to solve the problem as described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works and why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case.
2. **Reading Test Case Details**: For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and then reads the next line which contains `2n` integers. These integers are split into a list.
3. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted in ascending order.
4. **Score Calculation**: The program then sums up the first, third, fifth, etc., elements of the sorted list. This is because, in a sorted list, the smallest elements will be at the beginning, and by summing every other element starting from the first, we ensure that we are always adding the smaller of the two chosen numbers in each step.
5. **Output**: After processing each test case, the program prints the calculated score.

This approach is optimal because sorting the list ensures that we are always pairing the smallest available numbers together, which maximizes the sum of the minimums.

The execution summary aligns with this reasoning, confirming that the program correctly processes each test case and calculates the maximum possible score by summing the appropriate elements of the sorted list.

Correctness: **True**
