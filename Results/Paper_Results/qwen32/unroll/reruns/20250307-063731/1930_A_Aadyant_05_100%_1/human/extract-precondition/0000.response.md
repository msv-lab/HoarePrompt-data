Precondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of pairs of integers on the whiteboard. The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) which are the numbers written on the whiteboard. The total number of test cases t is between 1 and 5000.**
