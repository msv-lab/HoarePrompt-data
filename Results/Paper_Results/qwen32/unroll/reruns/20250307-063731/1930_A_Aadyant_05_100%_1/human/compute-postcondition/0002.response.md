The only variables in the loop head are `num` and `n`. The loop will execute based on the value of `n`. Specifically, the loop will execute `int(n)` times. To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least 1 (since `int(n)` should be a positive integer).

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is a single integer read from the input, representing the number of pairs of integers on the whiteboard and must be greater than or equal to 1; `final` is an empty list; `num` is initialized to 0**.

Since `num` is a loop variable, it is automatically initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, so we don't need to explicitly set it in the state before the loop starts. However, for clarity, we can mention that `num` will be initialized to 0 when the loop begins.
