You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of pairs of integers on the whiteboard. The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) which are the numbers written on the whiteboard. The total number of test cases t is between 1 and 5000.
def func():
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        
        list2 = []
        
        a = input()
        
        list1 = []
        
        b = input()
        
        list1 = b.split()
        
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        
        list2.sort()
        
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        
        final.append(s)
        
    #State: final is a list containing the sum of every other element (starting from the first) of the sorted list of integers for each pair of inputs.
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)
        
    #State: final is a list containing the sum of every other element (starting from the first) of the sorted list of integers for each pair of inputs.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of pairs of integers, and a list of `2n` integers. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
