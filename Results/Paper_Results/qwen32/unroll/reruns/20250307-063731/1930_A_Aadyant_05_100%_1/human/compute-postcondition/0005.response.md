To determine the output state, let's first understand the initial state and the loop's behavior.

The initial state mentions that `final` is a list containing the sum of every other element (starting from the first) of the sorted list of integers for each pair of inputs. However, the exact values of these sums are not provided, so we will consider `final` as a list with some generic values for demonstration purposes. Let's assume `final` is `[3, 5, 8]` for the sake of this example.

The loop provided is:
```python
for fin in final:
    print(fin)
```

This loop will iterate over each element in the `final` list and print it.

Let's go through the iterations:
1. In the first iteration, `fin` is `3`, and `print(fin)` outputs `3`.
2. In the second iteration, `fin` is `5`, and `print(fin)` outputs `5`.
3. In the third iteration, `fin` is `8`, and `print(fin)` outputs `8`.

Since the loop only prints the values and does not modify the `final` list or any other variables outside the loop, the state of `final` remains unchanged.

Output State: **final is a list containing the sum of every other element (starting from the first) of the sorted list of integers for each pair of inputs.** 

Given our example, the output state would specifically be: **final is [3, 5, 8].**

However, since we need to adhere strictly to the format provided and without specific values, the final answer in the required format is:

Output State: **final is a list containing the sum of every other element (starting from the first) of the sorted list of integers for each pair of inputs.**
