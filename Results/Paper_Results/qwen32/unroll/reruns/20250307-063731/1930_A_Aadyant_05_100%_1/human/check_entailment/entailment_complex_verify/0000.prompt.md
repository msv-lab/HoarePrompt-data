You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of pairs of integers on the whiteboard. The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) which are the numbers written on the whiteboard. The total number of test cases t is between 1 and 5000.
def func():
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        
        list2 = []
        
        a = input()
        
        list1 = []
        
        b = input()
        
        list1 = b.split()
        
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        
        list2.sort()
        
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        
        final.append(s)
        
    #State: final is a list containing the sum of every other element (starting from the first) of the sorted list of integers for each pair of inputs.
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)
        
    #State: final is a list containing the sum of every other element (starting from the first) of the sorted list of integers for each pair of inputs.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. For each test case, it sorts the list of integers, sums every other element starting from the first, and prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n` correctly.
   - However, for each test case, it incorrectly reads an extra line `a` which is not needed. The correct approach is to read only two lines per test case: the number of pairs `n` and the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program attempts to read the list of integers in two steps: it reads `a` (which is unnecessary) and then reads `b` (which contains the list of integers). This is incorrect because it should read the list of integers in one step.
   - The list of integers is then split and converted to integers, which is correct.

3. **Sorting and Summing:**
   - The program sorts the list of integers and sums every second element starting from the first. This approach is correct because sorting ensures that we are always summing the smallest possible pairs.

4. **Output:**
   - The program correctly stores the result for each test case and prints them at the end.

### Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
2
1
2 3
2
1 1 2 1
```

The program will read it as follows:
- First test case:
  - Reads `1` (correct).
  - Reads an unnecessary line (incorrect, this should be the list of integers).
  - Reads `2 3` (correct).
- Second test case:
  - Reads `2` (correct).
  - Reads an unnecessary line (incorrect, this should be the list of integers).
  - Reads `1 1 2 1` (correct).

The unnecessary line read in each test case will cause the program to fail because it will misinterpret the input. For example, if the input is:
```
2
1
2 3
2
1 1 2 1
```
The program will read it as:
- First test case:
  - `n = 1`
  - An unnecessary line (let's say it reads an empty line or something incorrect).
  - The list `2 3`.
- Second test case:
  - `n = 2`
  - An unnecessary line (let's say it reads an empty line or something incorrect).
  - The list `1 1 2 1`.

This misinterpretation will cause the program to not function as expected.

### Corrected Input Reading:
The correct way to read the input should be:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    final = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        list2 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        list2.sort()
        s = sum(list2[i] for i in range(0, len(list2), 2))
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)
```

This corrected version reads the input correctly and processes it as described in the problem statement.
