To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to analyze the loop's behavior and the effect of each iteration on the variable `t`.

The loop starts with the condition `while t > 0`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than zero. Inside the loop, `func_1()` is called (though the specific behavior of `func_1()` is not relevant to the state of `t`), and then `t` is decremented by 1 (`t -= 1`).

The loop will stop executing once `t` becomes 0 or less. Therefore, after the loop finishes, `t` will be equal to 0.

Output State: **t is 0.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, the value of the variable `t` will be 0.
