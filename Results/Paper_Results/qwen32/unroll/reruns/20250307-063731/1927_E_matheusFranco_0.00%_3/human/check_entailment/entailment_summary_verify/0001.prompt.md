You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    permutation = [0] * n
    idx = 0
    idx_v = 1
    curr_v = 1
    for i in range(k):
        multiples_of_k_plus_i = i
        while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
            permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v
            curr_v += 1
            multiples_of_k_plus_i += k
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        func_1()
        t -= 1



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads an integer input `t` and calls `func_1` a total of `t` times. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After execution, `t` is decremented to 0, and `func_1` is executed the number of times specified by the initial value of `t`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program correctly solves the problem, we need to analyze the logic and see if it constructs a k-level permutation as described in the problem statement.

### Analysis:

1. **Understanding the k-level permutation**:
   - A k-level permutation is a permutation of length `n` such that the sums of all continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
   - This means that if we take the sum of every `k` consecutive elements in the permutation, the maximum and minimum of these sums should be at most 1 apart.

2. **The algorithm in the program**:
   - The program initializes an array `permutation` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It then iterates over the first `k` indices and fills the array in a specific pattern:
     - For each `i` from `0` to `k-1`, it places the next value (`curr_v`) in the positions `i`, `i+k`, `i+2k`, etc., until it reaches the end of the array.
     - It increments `curr_v` after each placement.
   - This pattern ensures that the values are distributed in a specific way across the array.

3. **Evaluating the pattern**:
   - The pattern of filling the array ensures that the sums of every `k` consecutive elements are as close as possible.
   - Since `k` is even, the distribution of values will create a pattern where the sums of every `k` consecutive elements will be either the same or differ by 1.

4. **Checking the example cases**:
   - Let's verify the output for the example cases:
     - For `n=2, k=2`, the output is `2 1`. The sums are `2+1=3`, which is consistent.
     - For `n=3, k=2`, the output is `1 3 2`. The sums are `1+3=4` and `3+2=5`, which should be checked again.
     - For `n=10, k=4`, the output is `1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6`. The sums are `1+8+4+10=23`, `8+4+10+2=24`, `4+10+2+7=23`, `10+2+7+5=24`, `2+7+5+9=23`, `7+5+9+3=24`, `5+9+3+6=23`. The sums alternate between 23 and 24, which is consistent.
     - For `n=13, k=4`, the output is `4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7`. The sums are `4+10+1+13=28`, `10+1+13+5=29`, `1+13+5+9=28`, `13+5+9+2=29`, `5+9+2+12=28`, `9+2+12+6=29`, `2+12+6+8=28`, `12+6+8+3=29`, `6+8+3+11=28`, `8+3+11+7=29`. The sums alternate between 28 and 29, which is consistent.
     - For `n=7, k=4`, the output is `1 6 3 7 2 5 4`. The sums are `1+6+3+7=17`, `6+3+7+2=18`, `3+7+2+5=17`, `7+2+5+4=18`. The sums alternate between 17 and 18, which is consistent.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The pattern used in the program ensures that the sums of every `k` consecutive elements differ by no more than 1.
   - The program successfully constructs a k-level permutation for the given test cases.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The program uses a specific pattern to distribute values in the permutation array, ensuring that the sums of every `k` consecutive elements differ by no more than 1. This pattern is consistent with the definition of a k-level permutation and works for the given test cases.
Correctness: **True**
