You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    permutation = [0] * n
    idx = 0
    idx_v = 1
    curr_v = 1
    for i in range(k):
        multiples_of_k_plus_i = i
        while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
            permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v
            curr_v += 1
            multiples_of_k_plus_i += k
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        func_1()
        t -= 1



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads an integer input `t` and calls `func_1` a total of `t` times. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After execution, `t` is decremented to 0, and `func_1` is executed the number of times specified by the initial value of `t`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to construct a k-level permutation of length n.
- A k-level permutation is defined such that among all the sums of continuous segments of length k, any two sums differ by no more than 1.
- The permutation should consist of distinct integers from 1 to n.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function reads a single test case, constructs a permutation, and prints it.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

#### `func_1()` Analysis:
- The function initializes a permutation array of length `n` with all zeros.
- It then fills the permutation array in a specific pattern: it places values starting from 1 in positions that are multiples of `k` plus the current index `i` (i.e., `i, i+k, i+2k, ...`).
- The function prints the constructed permutation.

#### Potential Issues:
1. **Distinct Integers**: The function does not ensure that the permutation contains distinct integers from 1 to n.
2. **k-Level Property**: The function does not ensure that the constructed permutation is k-level, i.e., the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.

Let's consider an example to demonstrate the issues:

### Example:
For `n = 4` and `k = 2`, the function will generate a permutation like `[1, 0, 2, 0]`, which is incorrect because:
- It does not contain distinct integers from 1 to 4.
- It does not satisfy the k-level property.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, it fails to ensure that the permutation contains distinct integers from 1 to n and that it satisfies the k-level property.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly generate a k-level permutation for all cases. It fails to ensure that the permutation contains distinct integers from 1 to n and that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
