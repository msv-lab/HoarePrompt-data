Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not guarantee that the resulting permutation is k-level according to the problem description. The program fills the permutation array by placing numbers in specific positions based on the value of k, but it does not ensure that the sums of any two continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.

To construct a k-level permutation, a different strategy is needed. One possible approach is to alternate between placing the smallest and largest remaining numbers in a way that balances the sums of the segments of length k.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    permutation = [0] * n
    left = 1
    right = n
    for i in range(n):
        if (i // (k // 2)) % 2 == 0:
            permutation[i] = left
            left += 1
        else:
            permutation[i] = right
            right -= 1
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        func_1()
        t -= 1

# Example usage:
# func_2()
```

This corrected version alternates between placing the smallest and largest remaining numbers, which helps in balancing the sums of the segments of length k.
