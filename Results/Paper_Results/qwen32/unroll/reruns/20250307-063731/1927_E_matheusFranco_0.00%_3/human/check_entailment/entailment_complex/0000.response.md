### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its functions to determine if they produce the correct k-level permutation as described in the problem statement.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Objective**: Generate a k-level permutation of length `n` where the sums of any continuous segment of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
- **Method**:
  - Initialize a permutation list of size `n` with zeros.
  - Fill the permutation list by iterating `k` times. For each iteration `i`, fill the list at positions that are multiples of `k` plus `i` with increasing values starting from 1.
- **Example**:
  - For `n=10` and `k=4`, the permutation might look like `[1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4, 8, 9, 10]`.
  - The sums of segments of length `k` (4) would be `[1+5+2+6, 5+2+6+3, 2+6+3+7, 6+3+7+4, 3+7+4+8, 7+4+8+9, 4+8+9+10]`, which simplifies to `[14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 28, 31]`. This example does not satisfy the k-level condition as the sums differ by more than 1.
- **Issue**: The logic in `func_1` does not guarantee that the sums of any continuous segment of length `k` will differ by no more than 1. The current approach does not ensure a k-level permutation.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Objective**: Handle multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.
- **Method**:
  - Read the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, call `func_1` to generate and print a permutation.
- **Issue**: Since `func_1` does not generate a correct k-level permutation, `func_2` will also not produce the correct output for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly generate a k-level permutation as required by the problem statement. The logic in `func_1` needs to be revised to ensure that the sums of any continuous segment of length `k` differ by no more than 1.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
