Let's analyze the loop and how it modifies the `permutation` list.

The loop runs `k` times, and in each iteration, it starts filling the `permutation` list from the index equal to the current iteration number (`i`) and then fills every `k`-th element after that with the current value of `curr_v`, which increments after each assignment.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the loop modifies the `permutation` list:

1. For `i = 0`, the elements at indices `0, k, 2k, 3k, ...` are filled with `curr_v` values starting from `1`.
2. For `i = 1`, the elements at indices `1, k+1, 2k+1, 3k+1, ...` are filled with `curr_v` values starting from the next available `curr_v` value.
3. This pattern continues until `i = k-1`, where the elements at indices `k-1, 2k-1, 3k-1, ...` are filled.

Since `k` is even and `2 <= k <= n`, the loop ensures that every position in the `permutation` list will be filled exactly once by the end of the loop, as each position in the list will be hit by one of the sequences generated by the loop iterations.

The `idx`, `idx_v`, and `curr_v` variables are not directly used in the loop body in a way that affects the final state of `permutation`. However, `curr_v` will be incremented each time an element in `permutation` is assigned a value, so its final value will be `n + 1` (since `n` elements are assigned values from `1` to `n`).

Thus, the final state of `permutation` will be a list of integers from `1` to `n` in a specific order determined by the loop logic.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 2 <= k <= n, and k is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` where each index `j` is filled with the value `floor(j/k) * k + (j % k) + 1`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is n + 1.**
