### Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even, and ensuring that the sums of all continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1. The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

- **`func_1`**: This function is responsible for generating a single permutation of length `n` based on the value of `k`. The approach taken is to place values in the permutation in a specific pattern where each position `j` is filled such that elements are grouped in steps of `k`. This means that elements at positions `i, i+k, i+2k, ...` are filled sequentially with increasing values. The final permutation is printed as a space-separated string.

- **`func_2`**: This function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case. It handles multiple test cases by repeatedly invoking `func_1` until all test cases are processed.

### Analysis:

Let's analyze whether `func_1` generates a k-level permutation. The function distributes the values in such a way that each group of `k` elements is filled in a sequential manner, but it doesn't ensure that the sums of all continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1. The pattern of filling values in `func_1` does not guarantee the k-level property. For example, if we consider the case `n=10` and `k=4`, the permutation generated by `func_1` might be something like `[1, 5, 9, 3, 7, 11, 2, 6, 10, 4]`, and the sums of segments of length 4 would not necessarily meet the k-level condition.

The provided example outputs do not match the behavior of `func_1` as described. The example outputs are specific k-level permutations that meet the problem's requirements, but `func_1` does not generate such permutations.

### Conclusion:

Since `func_1` does not ensure that the generated permutation is a k-level permutation, the overall program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
