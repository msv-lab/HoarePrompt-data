### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and determine if it correctly constructs a k-level permutation for each test case.

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Reads the integers `n` and `k` for the current test case.
   - Initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - Uses a loop to fill the `permutation` list:
     - For each `i` from 0 to `k-1`, it places the next available integer (`curr_v`) into every `k`-th position starting from `i`.
     - This means the first `k` positions will be filled with `1, 2, ..., k`, the next `k` positions with `k+1, k+2, ..., 2k`, and so on.
   - After constructing the `permutation` list, it prints the permutation.

Let's examine if this approach constructs a k-level permutation:

- The permutation is constructed such that the first `k` elements are `1, 2, ..., k`, the next `k` elements are `k+1, k+2, ..., 2k`, and so on. This ensures that all sums of any continuous segment of length `k` are the same because each segment will contain exactly one element from each of the `k` groups.

- For example, if `n=10` and `k=4`, the permutation constructed would be `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10`. The sums of the segments of length `k=4` would be:
  - `1+2+3+4 = 10`
  - `2+3+4+5 = 14`
  - `3+4+5+6 = 18`
  - `4+5+6+7 = 22`
  - `5+6+7+8 = 26`
  - `6+7+8+9 = 30`
  - `7+8+9+10 = 34`

This example does not yield a k-level permutation. The sums of the segments vary by more than 1. Therefore, the implementation in `func_1` does not correctly generate a k-level permutation.

### Correctness:

Based on the analysis, the program does not correctly construct a k-level permutation for the given problem.

**Correctness: False**
