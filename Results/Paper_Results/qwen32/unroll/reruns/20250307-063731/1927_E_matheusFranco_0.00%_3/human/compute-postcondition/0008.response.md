To determine the output of the `print(result)` statement, we need to understand the structure and values of the `permutation` list and how it is constructed.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `n` and `k` are integers where `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even.
   - `permutation` is a list of length `n`.
   - `idx`, `idx_v`, and `curr_v` are initialized to 0, 1, and `n + 1` respectively.
   - `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `permutation` converted to strings.

2. **Construction of `permutation`:**
   - Each element of `permutation` at index `j` is calculated using the formula: `floor(j/k) * k + (j % k) + 1`.
   - Let's break down the formula:
     - `floor(j/k)` gives the integer division of `j` by `k`.
     - `floor(j/k) * k` gives the largest multiple of `k` less than or equal to `j`.
     - `(j % k)` gives the remainder when `j` is divided by `k`.
     - Adding 1 to the result ensures the values start from 1 instead of 0.

3. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `n = 10` and `k = 4`.
   - We can calculate each element of `permutation` as follows:
     - For `j = 0`: `floor(0/4) * 4 + (0 % 4) + 1 = 0 * 4 + 0 + 1 = 1`
     - For `j = 1`: `floor(1/4) * 4 + (1 % 4) + 1 = 0 * 4 + 1 + 1 = 2`
     - For `j = 2`: `floor(2/4) * 4 + (2 % 4) + 1 = 0 * 4 + 2 + 1 = 3`
     - For `j = 3`: `floor(3/4) * 4 + (3 % 4) + 1 = 0 * 4 + 3 + 1 = 4`
     - For `j = 4`: `floor(4/4) * 4 + (4 % 4) + 1 = 1 * 4 + 0 + 1 = 5`
     - For `j = 5`: `floor(5/4) * 4 + (5 % 4) + 1 = 1 * 4 + 1 + 1 = 6`
     - For `j = 6`: `floor(6/4) * 4 + (6 % 4) + 1 = 1 * 4 + 2 + 1 = 7`
     - For `j = 7`: `floor(7/4) * 4 + (7 % 4) + 1 = 1 * 4 + 3 + 1 = 8`
     - For `j = 8`: `floor(8/4) * 4 + (8 % 4) + 1 = 2 * 4 + 0 + 1 = 9`
     - For `j = 9`: `floor(9/4) * 4 + (9 % 4) + 1 = 2 * 4 + 1 + 1 = 10`

4. **Result Construction:**
   - The `permutation` list for `n = 10` and `k = 4` would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.
   - The `result` string would be the space-separated concatenation of these elements: `"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"`.

### General Case:
- For any `n` and `k` (where `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even), the `permutation` list will be constructed such that each block of `k` elements will be a sequence starting from `1` and incrementing by `1` until `k`, then the next block will start from `k+1` and so on.
- The `result` string will be the space-separated concatenation of these elements.

### Final Output:
Output: **result (where result is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of the permutation list constructed based on the formula `floor(j/k) * k + (j % k) + 1` for j in range(n))**
