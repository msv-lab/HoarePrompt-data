Let's analyze the provided program based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to construct a k-level permutation of length n.
- A k-level permutation is defined such that among all the sums of continuous segments of length k, any two sums differ by no more than 1.
- The permutation should consist of distinct integers from 1 to n.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function reads a single test case, constructs a permutation, and prints it.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

#### `func_1()` Analysis:
- The function initializes a permutation array of length `n` with all zeros.
- It then fills the permutation array in a specific pattern: it places values starting from 1 in positions that are multiples of `k` plus the current index `i` (i.e., `i, i+k, i+2k, ...`).
- The function prints the constructed permutation.

#### Potential Issues:
1. **Distinct Integers**: The function does not ensure that the permutation contains distinct integers from 1 to n.
2. **k-Level Property**: The function does not ensure that the constructed permutation is k-level, i.e., the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.

Let's consider an example to demonstrate the issues:

### Example:
For `n = 4` and `k = 2`, the function will generate a permutation like `[1, 0, 2, 0]`, which is incorrect because:
- It does not contain distinct integers from 1 to 4.
- It does not satisfy the k-level property.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, it fails to ensure that the permutation contains distinct integers from 1 to n and that it satisfies the k-level property.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly generate a k-level permutation for all cases. It fails to ensure that the permutation contains distinct integers from 1 to n and that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
