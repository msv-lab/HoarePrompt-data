Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 2 <= k <= n, and k is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` where each index `j` is filled with the value `floor(j/k) * k + (j % k) + 1`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is n + 1; `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `permutation` converted to strings.**

In simple terms, the output state includes the same values for `n`, `k`, `permutation`, `idx`, `idx_v`, and `curr_v` as in the initial state. Additionally, a new variable `result` is introduced, which is a string formed by joining the elements of the `permutation` list, with each element converted to a string and separated by spaces.
