The code snippet converts the input string `s` into a list of characters. The initial state specifies that `s` is a string, and after the execution of the code, `s` is now a list of characters derived from that string. The value of `t` and the constraints on the strings `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `s` is a list of characters derived from a string of length between 1 and 5000, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. The total length of all strings `s` across all test cases does not exceed 5000.**
