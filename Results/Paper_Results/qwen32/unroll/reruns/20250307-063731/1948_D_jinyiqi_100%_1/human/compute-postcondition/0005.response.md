Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly but is expected to handle `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For each test case, it processes a string `s` of length between 1 and 5000, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. The total length of all strings `s` across all test cases does not exceed 5000. The function returns a result for each test case based on the content of the string `s`.**
