Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `s` is a list of characters derived from a string of length between 1 and 5000, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. The total length of all strings `s` across all test cases does not exceed 5000. `n` is the length of the list `s`.**

This means that the variable `n` has been assigned the value of the length of the list `s`, which is the number of characters in the string `s`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
