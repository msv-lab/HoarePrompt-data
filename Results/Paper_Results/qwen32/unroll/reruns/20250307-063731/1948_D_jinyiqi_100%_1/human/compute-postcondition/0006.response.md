Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads a string `s` from input, processes it to find the longest palindromic subsequence that can be formed by replacing question marks with any lowercase Latin letter or leaving them as they are, and prints twice the length of this subsequence if found. If no such subsequence of length greater than 1 is found, it prints 0. This process is repeated for `t` test cases, where `t` is the number of test cases provided as input.**
