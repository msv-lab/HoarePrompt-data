The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `0`. The initial state does not provide any information about variables or objects that could influence the `print` statement, as the statement directly prints the integer `0`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print(0)` statement is executed.
2. The integer `0` is passed to the `print` function.
3. The `print` function outputs the integer `0` to the console.

Since there are no variables or conditions affecting the output, the output is straightforward.

Output: **0**
