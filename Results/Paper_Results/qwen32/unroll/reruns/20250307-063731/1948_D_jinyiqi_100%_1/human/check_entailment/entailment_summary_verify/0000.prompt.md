You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s , consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or
question marks.

A tandem repeat is a string of an even length such that its first half is
equal to its second half.

A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by the
deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and
several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

Your goal is to replace each question mark with some lowercase Latin letter in
such a way that the length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat is
maximum possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The only line of each testcase contains a string s (1 \le |s| \le 5000 ),
consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.

The total length of the strings over all testcases doesn't exceed 5000 .

Output

For each testcase, print a single integer — the maximum length of the longest
substring that is a tandem repeat after you replace each question mark in the
string with some lowercase Latin letter.

If it's impossible to make any tandem repeat substrings in the string, print 0
.

Example

Input

    4
    
    zaabaabz
    
    ?????
    
    code?????s
    
    codeforces

Output

    6
    4
    10
    0

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
    print(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads a string `s` from input, processes it to find the longest palindromic subsequence that can be formed by replacing question marks with any lowercase Latin letter or leaving them as they are, and prints twice the length of this subsequence if found. If no such subsequence of length greater than 1 is found, it prints 0. This process is repeated for `t` test cases, where `t` is the number of test cases provided as input.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the replacement of question marks to maximize the length of the longest tandem repeat substring.

### Issues:
1. **Question Mark Replacement**: The program does not replace any question marks with actual letters. It only checks if the current characters (including question marks) can form a tandem repeat.
2. **Tandem Repeat Logic**: The logic for checking tandem repeats is not entirely correct. The program checks if characters at positions `k` and `k + j` are either equal or if either of them is a question mark. This is not sufficient to ensure that the longest possible tandem repeat is found after replacing question marks optimally.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the entire string can be made into a tandem repeat by replacing question marks.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input string `"?a?a?a?a?"`. The program would output `0` because it does not replace the question marks to form a tandem repeat. However, by replacing the question marks with the same letter (e.g., `aaaaaa`), the longest tandem repeat is `6`.

### Correct Approach:
To fix the program, it should:
- Replace question marks optimally to form the longest possible tandem repeat.
- Use a more robust algorithm to check for tandem repeats after potential replacements.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.
