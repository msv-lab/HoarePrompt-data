The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. After executing this line, the value of `t` will be the integer input provided, and it will still satisfy the condition 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, and `t` is the input integer.**
