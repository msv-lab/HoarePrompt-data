In the given task, the for loop will execute based on the value of the variable `t`. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the range `t`. Since the loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable (not used in the loop body), the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is the value of `t`.

The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Given that the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, the loop is already guaranteed to execute without any adjustment needed. However, to strictly adhere to the requirement of only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, we don't need to change anything about `t` since it already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts is already in the correct form for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4**
