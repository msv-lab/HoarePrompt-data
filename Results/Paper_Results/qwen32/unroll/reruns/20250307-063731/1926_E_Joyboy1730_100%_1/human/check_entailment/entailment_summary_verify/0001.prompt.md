You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        L = []
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
            L.append(m)
        tot = 0
        pow = 1
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
            tot += a
            pow *= 2



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k` with `1 ≤ k ≤ n`. For each test case, it computes and prints a specific integer value based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to determine the k-th card laid down by Vladislav based on a specific sequence of laying down cards. The sequence is defined by laying down all odd-numbered cards first, then all cards that are twice an odd number, then all cards that are three times an odd number, and so on, until all cards are laid down.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of cards) and `k` (the position of the card to be found).

2. **List L Construction:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `L`.
   - It then enters a loop where it calculates `m = (n + 1) // 2` and subtracts `m` from `n`, appending `m` to `L` each time.
   - This process continues until `n` becomes 0.
   - The list `L` is supposed to store the number of cards laid down in each pass (odd numbers, twice odd numbers, etc.).

3. **Determine k-th Card:**
   - The program initializes `tot` to 0 (total cards laid down so far) and `pow` to 1 (multiplier for the current pass).
   - It iterates over the list `L` to find the pass where the k-th card is laid down.
   - If `tot < k <= tot + a`, it prints the k-th card in the current pass, which is calculated as `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
   - It then updates `tot` by adding `a` and multiplies `pow` by 2 for the next pass.

### Correctness Check:
- **List L Construction:**
  - The list `L` correctly stores the number of cards laid down in each pass. For example, if `n = 7`, `L` will be `[4, 2, 1]`, representing the number of cards laid down in the first, second, and third passes, respectively.
  
- **Finding the k-th Card:**
  - The program correctly identifies the pass where the k-th card is laid down and calculates its value. For example, for `n = 7` and `k = 5`, the 5th card is `2`, which is correctly identified.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases such as `n = 1` and `k = 1` correctly.
  - It also handles larger values of `n` and `k` as specified in the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the k-th card laid down by Vladislav based on the given sequence. The logic for constructing the list `L` and finding the k-th card is sound and efficient.
