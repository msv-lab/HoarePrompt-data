The provided code snippet only defines a type variable `T` using Python's `TypeVar` from the `typing` module. This does not affect any of the initial variables (`t`, `n`, `v`, `p`). Therefore, the state of the program remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 200,000; the second line contains a list v of n integers where each integer v_i satisfies 1 <= v_i <= 10^9; the third line contains a permutation p of n integers from 1 to n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
