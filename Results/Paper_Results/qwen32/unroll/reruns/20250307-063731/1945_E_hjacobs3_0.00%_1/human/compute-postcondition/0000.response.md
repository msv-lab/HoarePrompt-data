The code snippet assigns the length of the list `array` to the variable `n`. Since `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, the length of `array` is indeed `n`. Therefore, after executing the code, `n` will hold the value of the length of `array`.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that needs to be found in the permutation; `n` is the length of `array`.**
