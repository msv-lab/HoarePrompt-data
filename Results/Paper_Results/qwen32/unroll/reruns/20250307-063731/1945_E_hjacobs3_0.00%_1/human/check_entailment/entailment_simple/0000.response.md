### Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by using a binary search approach after potentially performing up to two swaps on the permutation. However, there are several issues with the provided `func_1` function that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The binary search in the function is incorrect. The loop condition `while l <= r` is incorrect for this problem. It should be `while l < r` to prevent the loop from running indefinitely when `l` equals `r`.
   - The logic for updating `l` and `r` is also incorrect. The correct logic should be:
     - If `array[mid] < find`, then `l = mid + 1`.
     - If `array[mid] >= find`, then `r = mid`.
   - The current implementation does not correctly narrow down the search space.

2. **Checking the Index:**
   - After the binary search, the function checks if `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in the array. If they are not equal, it suggests a swap is needed.
   - However, the function only performs one swap and does not consider the possibility of needing a second swap to make the binary search successful.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The function should return the number of swaps performed (0, 1, or 2) followed by the swap operations if any.
   - The current implementation only handles the case where one swap is needed and does not address the scenario where two swaps are necessary.

### Correctness:

Given the issues mentioned above, the program is not correct for solving the problem as described. The binary search implementation is flawed, and the function does not account for the possibility of needing two swaps.

**Correctness: False**
