Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Here are the issues:

1. The function `func_1` is supposed to return the number of operations and the indices to swap, but the program currently prints the number of operations inside the function and returns a list of strings for the indices. The main part of the code then tries to print the result again, which is incorrect.

2. The binary search implementation in `func_1` is incorrect. The loop condition should be `l < r` instead of `l <= r` to match the problem's description of the binary search algorithm.

3. The logic to determine when to swap elements is not correct. The program only checks if the final `l` is at the correct position of `x`, but it does not ensure that the array is in a state where binary search will lead to `l` being at the correct position after at most two swaps.

4. The function does not handle the case where more than one swap is needed to correctly position `x` for binary search.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_position_to_swap(arr, x):
    n = len(arr)
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    while l < r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if arr[mid] < x:
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid
    return l

def solve(arr, x):
    n = len(arr)
    target_index = find_position_to_swap(arr, x)
    
    if arr[target_index] == x:
        return 0, []
    
    # Try to place x at target_index
    x_index = arr.index(x)
    if x_index != target_index:
        arr[x_index], arr[target_index] = arr[target_index], arr[x_index]
        return 1, [(x_index + 1, target_index + 1)]
    
    # If x is already at target_index, we need to swap it out temporarily
    # and then bring it back
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] != x:
            arr[x_index], arr[i] = arr[i], arr[x_index]
            first_swap = (x_index + 1, i + 1)
            x_index = i
            break
    
    target_index = find_position_to_swap(arr, x)
    arr[x_index], arr[target_index] = arr[target_index], arr[x_index]
    second_swap = (x_index + 1, target_index + 1)
    
    return 2, [first_swap, second_swap]

t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    k, swaps = solve(arr, x)
    results.append((k, swaps))

for k, swaps in results:
    print(k)
    for swap in swaps:
        print(" ".join(map(str, swap)))
```

This corrected version properly handles the logic of finding the correct position for `x` and performs the necessary swaps to ensure that binary search will correctly identify `x`.
