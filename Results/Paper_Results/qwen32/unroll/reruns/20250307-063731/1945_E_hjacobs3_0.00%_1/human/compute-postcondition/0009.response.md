Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `array`, which is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to n, and a parameter `find`, which is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n) that needs to be found in the permutation. The function returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the value of `l + 1` (where `l` is the index of the first occurrence of `find` in the array), and the second string is the value of the index of the first occurrence of `find` in the array plus 1.**
