### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the given program.

#### Problem Description Recap:
1. **Input**: A permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` to find.
2. **Goal**: Rearrange the permutation using at most 2 swaps such that after performing a binary search, the element at the position `l` is equal to `x`.
3. **Binary Search**: The binary search algorithm as described should end when `r - l = 1`, and it should correctly identify the position `l` such that `p[l]` is the smallest element in the array that is not less than `x`.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code has several issues:
1. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The loop condition `while l <= r` is incorrect. It should be `while r - l > 1` to match the problem's binary search description.
   - The logic for adjusting `l` and `r` is incorrect. The current implementation does not correctly follow the binary search procedure as described.

2. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The code only performs one swap if `l` is not the index of `x` in the array. However, the problem allows up to two swaps, and the code does not explore the possibility of using two swaps to achieve the desired result.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The code prints the number of swaps and the swap indices directly within the function `func_1`, which is not the correct approach as it should return these values to be printed in the main loop.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where `x` is not in the array or where `x` is already at the correct position after the binary search.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
The function summary describes the function `func_1` as returning a list containing two strings: the position of the smallest element in the list that is not less than the integer to find, and the position of the integer to find in the list. This summary is not accurate because:
- The function should not only return positions but also handle the swapping logic correctly.
- The binary search logic described in the summary does not match the problem's requirements.

#### Evaluation:
Given the issues with the binary search logic, the swapping logic, and the output format, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution as per the problem description. The original assessment is accurate in identifying these issues.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
