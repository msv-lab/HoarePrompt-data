The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state describes the values and conditions of variables `l` and `r`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `l` is defined as the smallest index such that all elements at indices less than `l` are less than `find`.
   - `r` is defined as `l - 1`.
   - The current value of `l` is not equal to the index of the first occurrence of `find` in the array.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement is `print(1)`, which directly outputs the integer `1`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference `l`, `r`, or any other variables from the initial state, the values of `l` and `r` do not affect the output.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
