The given `print` statement is `print(0)`. This statement is independent of the variables `l` and `r` as well as the value of `find` described in the initial state. The `print(0)` statement will simply output the integer `0`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes the variables `l` and `r` and their relationships with the array and the value `find`.
2. The `print` statement is `print(0)`, which directly outputs the integer `0` without referencing any of the variables described in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **0**
