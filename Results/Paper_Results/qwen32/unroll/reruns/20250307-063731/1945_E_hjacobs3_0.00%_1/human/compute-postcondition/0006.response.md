Output State: **The program returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the value of `l + 1`, and the second string is the value of the index of the first occurrence of `find` in the array plus 1.**

This means the output will be a list with two string elements, where the first element is one more than the smallest index `l` such that all elements at indices less than `l` are less than `find`, and the second element is one more than the index of the first occurrence of `find` in the array.
