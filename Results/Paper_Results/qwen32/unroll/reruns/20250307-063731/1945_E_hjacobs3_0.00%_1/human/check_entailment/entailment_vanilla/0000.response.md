Reasoning:

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search implementation in the `func_1` function is incorrect. The loop condition should be `l < r` instead of `l <= r` because when `l` equals `r`, the binary search should have already found the correct position or concluded that the element is not present. However, the main issue is that the logic inside the loop does not correctly narrow down the search space. The condition `if array[mid] >= find` should be `if array[mid] < find` to correctly adjust the search range.

2. **Checking and Swapping Logic**: The program checks if `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in the array. If not, it suggests a single swap between `l` and the index of `find`. However, this approach does not guarantee that after two swaps, the binary search will correctly identify `x` as `p_l`. The problem requires ensuring that after the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`, which might require more strategic swapping.

3. **Output Handling**: The function `func_1` is supposed to return a list of operations (swaps) needed to make the binary search successful. However, the current implementation prints the number of swaps directly and returns a list that is not correctly formatted for multiple swaps. The main function also incorrectly handles the output of `func_1`.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program reads multiple test cases but does not correctly accumulate and format the results for all test cases. The output should be formatted as specified in the problem statement.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
