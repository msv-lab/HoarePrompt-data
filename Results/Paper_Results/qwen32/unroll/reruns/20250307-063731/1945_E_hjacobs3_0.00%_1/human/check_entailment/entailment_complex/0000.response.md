### Reasoning:

The provided program is supposed to solve the problem of finding a number `x` in a permutation `p` using binary search by performing up to 2 swaps if necessary. However, the implementation in `func_1` does not correctly address the problem's requirements. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search in the `func_1` function is incorrect. The condition `if array[mid] >= find` and the subsequent assignments to `l` and `r` do not correctly narrow down the search space to find the exact position of `x`. Instead, it finds the smallest index `l` such that all elements before `l` are less than `x`.

2. **Swapping Logic**: The logic for determining when to swap elements is flawed. The function checks if `l` (the index found by the binary search) is equal to the index of `x` in the array. If not, it suggests a single swap between `l` and the index of `x`. However, this does not guarantee that a binary search will correctly find `x` after the swap. The function does not consider the possibility of performing up to 2 swaps to make the binary search successful.

3. **Output Format**: The function is supposed to output the number of swaps and the swap operations themselves. However, it only outputs the number of swaps and the positions to be swapped, without actually performing the swaps on the array. This means the binary search is not run on the modified array.

### Correctness:

Given the above points, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It does not ensure that binary search can find `x` after performing up to 2 swaps, and it does not modify the array before running the binary search.

**Correctness: False**

### Explanation of Why It's Incorrect:

- The binary search implementation does not correctly find the position of `x`.
- The swapping logic does not ensure that binary search will find `x` after up to 2 swaps.
- The array is not modified before running the binary search, so the correctness of the binary search is not verified.

The program needs to be modified to correctly implement the logic for up to 2 swaps and to ensure that the binary search can find `x` in the modified array.
