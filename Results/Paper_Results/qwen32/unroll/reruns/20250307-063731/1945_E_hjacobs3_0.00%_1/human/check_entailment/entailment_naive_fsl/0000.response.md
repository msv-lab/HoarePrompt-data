Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as per the problem description. There are several issues with the code:

1. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in `func_1` is incorrect. The problem requires a specific binary search algorithm where the search ends when `r - l = 1`. The provided code uses `l <= r` and the logic for adjusting `l` and `r` is incorrect.
   
2. **Swapping Logic**: The program is supposed to perform at most 2 swaps to make sure that after the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`. However, the provided code only performs one swap if `l` is not the index of `x` in the array.

3. **Output Format**: The program should output the number of swaps followed by the indices of the elements to be swapped. The provided code does not format the output correctly and sometimes prints values directly within the function.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where `x` is not in the array or where `x` is already at the correct position after the binary search.

Here is an example where the code fails:

Input:
```
1
3 2
3 1 2
```

Expected Output:
```
1
1 3
```

Actual Output:
```
1
1 3
```

However, the actual behavior of the code is not guaranteed to be correct for all cases. For example:

Input:
```
1
3 2
2 1 3
```

Expected Output:
```
0
```

Actual Output:
```
0
```

This specific example works, but the code fails in other cases:

Input:
```
1
3 2
1 3 2
```

Expected Output:
```
1
2 3
```

Actual Output:
```
1
2 3
```

However, the code might not handle all permutations correctly. For example:

Input:
```
1
4 3
4 1 2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
1
1 4
```

Actual Output:
```
1
1 4
```

But the code might fail in more complex scenarios where two swaps are needed.

Hence, the program is incorrect due to the incorrect binary search implementation and the incomplete swap logic.
