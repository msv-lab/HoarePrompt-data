To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `l <= r` is true right before the loop starts. Given the initial states:

- `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
- `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that needs to be found in the permutation.
- `n` is the length of `array`.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 1`.

The condition `l <= r` will be true if `0 <= n - 1`, which simplifies to `n >= 1`. Since `n` is the length of the permutation and permutations are defined for lengths of at least 1, the condition `l <= r` will always be true for valid inputs.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states of `l` and `r` for the loop to execute the first time. The state right before the loop is already sufficient for the loop to proceed.

State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that needs to be found in the permutation, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`**
