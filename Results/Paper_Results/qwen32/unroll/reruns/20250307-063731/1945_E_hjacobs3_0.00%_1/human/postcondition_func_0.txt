The function accepts a list of integers representing a permutation and an integer to find within that permutation. It returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the position of the smallest element in the list that is not less than the integer to find, and the second string is the position of the integer to find in the list. If the smallest element not less than the integer to find is the integer itself, it prints 0; otherwise, it prints 1.
