Reasoning: 

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. The task is to manipulate the permutation such that after performing a binary search, the element at the position `l` is equal to `x`. The program is attempting to perform a binary search to find the position of `x` and then print a swap operation if `x` is not already at the position `l`. However, the program does not actually perform any swaps on the array to ensure that the binary search will find `x` at position `l`. 

The program also incorrectly handles the output format. The problem requires the number of swaps followed by the swap operations, but the program prints the number of swaps and then the positions directly, without formatting them as required. Additionally, the binary search implementation in the program is not correctly set up to ensure that the final `l` will point to `x` after at most two swaps.

The binary search logic in the program is also flawed. It should be checking if `array[mid] < x` to move the left pointer, and if `array[mid] >= x` to move the right pointer, but the conditionals are reversed. This would cause the binary search to not function as intended.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
