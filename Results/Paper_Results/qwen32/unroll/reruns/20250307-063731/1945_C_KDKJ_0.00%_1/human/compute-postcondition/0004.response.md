To determine the output state, let's analyze the loop:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer input.
   - `a` is a string input.
   - `S` is initialized as `[[0, 0]]`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each character `s` in the string `a`.
   - For each character `s`:
     - The last element of `S` (which is a list `[x, y]`) is retrieved.
     - If `s` is `'0'`, increment `x` by 1.
     - If `s` is not `'0'` (i.e., `'1'`), increment `y` by 1.
     - Append the new list `[x, y]` to `S`.

3. **Output State**:
   - After the loop completes, `S` will contain a list of lists where each list `[x, y]` represents the cumulative count of `'0'`s and `'1'`s encountered up to that point in the string `a`.

To summarize, `S` will have `len(a) + 1` elements, with the first element being `[0, 0]` and each subsequent element being the cumulative count of `'0'`s and `'1'`s up to that index in the string `a`.

**Output State**: **`S` is a list of lists where each list `[x, y]` represents the cumulative count of `'0'`s and `'1'`s up to that point in the string `a`. The final `S` will have `len(a) + 1` elements.**
