In the provided for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable that we do not intend to use. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. Therefore, the state we need to adjust is the input that will be provided to the `input()` function, which should be a string that can be converted to an integer and is greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **The input to the `input()` function must be a string representing an integer greater than 0.**
