### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic and correctness of the provided code.

**Function `func_1`:**
- **Purpose:** To determine the optimal position to place the road such that at least half of the residents on each side of the road are satisfied with their side.
- **Implementation:**
  - It initializes a list `S` with `[0, 0]` to keep track of cumulative counts of '0's and '1's.
  - For each character in the string `a`, it updates the cumulative counts and appends them to `S`.
  - It then iterates through each possible position `i` to check if placing the road after the `i-th` house satisfies the condition that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
  - If the condition is satisfied and the position is closer to the middle of the village, it updates the answer `ans`.
  - Finally, it prints the optimal position `ans`.

**Function `func_2`:**
- **Purpose:** To handle multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.
- **Implementation:**
  - It reads the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, it calls `func_1`.

### Analysis:
- The logic in `func_1` is correct in terms of calculating the cumulative counts and checking the conditions for each possible position of the road.
- The function correctly handles the constraints and ensures that the road is placed as close to the middle of the village as possible.
- The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position to place the road for each test case, adhering to the problem description.

**Correctness:** **True**
