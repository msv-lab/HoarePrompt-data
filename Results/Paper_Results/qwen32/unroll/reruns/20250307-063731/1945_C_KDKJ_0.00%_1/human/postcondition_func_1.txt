The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer input that specifies the number of test cases, and for each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`. The state of the program after execution is that `func_1()` has been called the number of times specified by the input integer, and no other variables or state in the program are modified by `func_2` itself.
