Output State: **No variables are present in the function signature of `func_2`. It does not take any parameters and does not return any value. It is designed to handle multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case. The loop has executed for the number of iterations specified by the integer input, calling `func_1()` in each iteration. The state of other variables not affected by the loop remains unchanged.**
