Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. It then determines whether to print 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions related to the count of '1's in the string and the presence of consecutive '11's. The function does not return any value; it only prints output for each test case.**
