To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided loop and how it modifies the variables `s` and `ans`.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a string with all occurrences of 'map' removed.
   - `ans` is the number of times 'map' was found and removed from `s`.

2. **Loop Code:**
   ```python
   while s.find('pie') != -1:
       s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
       ans += 1
   ```

3. **Loop Behavior:**
   - The loop continues to execute as long as the substring 'pie' is found in `s`.
   - In each iteration:
     - `s.find('pie')` locates the first occurrence of 'pie' in `s`.
     - The string `s` is then updated to exclude the 'pi' part of 'pie' by concatenating the substring before 'pie' and the substring after 'pie' (skipping the first two characters of 'pie').
     - `ans` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of 'pie' found and removed.

4. **Output State:**
   - The loop will continue to remove 'pie' from `s` until there are no more occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.
   - `ans` will be incremented by 1 for each 'pie' found and removed.

### Example:
Let's assume the initial state is:
- `s = "applepiebanana"`
- `ans = 0` (since no 'map' was found in the original string)

After the first iteration:
- `s.find('pie')` returns 5.
- `s` becomes `"applebanana"` (removing 'pi' from 'pie').
- `ans` becomes 1.

Since 'pie' is no longer in `s`, the loop terminates.

### Final Output State:
- `s` will no longer contain any occurrences of 'pie'.
- `ans` will reflect the total number of 'pie' substrings that were found and removed from `s`.

**Output State:** **`s` is a string with all occurrences of 'pie' removed, and `ans` is the number of times 'pie' was found and removed from `s`.**

In natural language: The final state is that all occurrences of the substring 'pie' have been removed from the string `s`, and `ans` holds the count of how many times 'pie' was found and removed.
