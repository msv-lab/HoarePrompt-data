Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string `s` to make it beautiful (i.e., to ensure that it does not contain the substrings "map" or "pie"). The program should handle multiple test cases, where each case consists of a string `s`.

### Program Analysis
The program consists of two parts:
1. The main loop which reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
2. The function `func_1(s)` which calculates the minimum number of deletions required to make the string `s` beautiful.

#### Main Loop
The main loop correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the length of the string `n` (which is not used in the function) and the string `s` itself. It then calls the function `func_1(s)` to compute the result and prints it.

#### Function `func_1(s)`
The function `func_1(s)` is intended to remove the substrings "map" and "pie" from the string `s` and count the number of deletions required.

1. **Special Case for 'mapie'**: The function first checks if the string `s` is exactly "mapie". If it is, it returns 1. However, this special case is unnecessary and incorrect because the function should handle all cases uniformly. For instance, "mapie" can be made beautiful by removing "map" first, resulting in "pie", and then removing "pie", resulting in the empty string. This would require 2 deletions, not 1. Therefore, this special case is incorrect and should be removed.
   
2. **Removing 'map'**: The function uses a `while` loop to find and remove all occurrences of "map" in the string `s`. Each time "map" is found, it is removed by concatenating the parts of the string before and after "map", with the middle two characters (the 'm' and 'p') removed. The counter `ans` is incremented each time a deletion is made.
   
3. **Removing 'pie'**: Similarly, the function uses another `while` loop to find and remove all occurrences of "pie" in the string `s`. Each time "pie" is found, it is removed by concatenating the parts of the string before and after "pie", with the middle two characters (the 'i' and 'p') removed. The counter `ans` is incremented each time a deletion is made.
   
4. **Return the Result**: Finally, the function returns the total count of deletions `ans`.

### Issues with the Program
- The special case for "mapie" is incorrect and should be removed.
- The function does not handle overlapping substrings correctly. For example, the string "mappie" should be reduced to an empty string in 3 steps (remove "map" first, then "pie"), but the function will only remove "map" and then "pie", resulting in "ie", which is incorrect.
- The function does not account for the possibility of multiple deletions affecting each other. For instance, removing a character in one substring might make another substring appear.

### Correctness
Given the above issues, the program is not correct. It does not handle all cases correctly, especially those involving overlapping substrings.

Correctness: **False**
