Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, the code does not account for overlapping occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" properly. When a substring is found and removed, the search for the next occurrence should start from the beginning of the modified string. However, the current implementation starts searching from the position right after the last removed substring, which can lead to incorrect results.

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
10
mapmapiepie
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- The string "mapmapiepie" contains the substrings "map" and "pie".
- Removing the first "map" results in "mapiepie".
- Removing the "pie" in "mapiepie" results in "mae".
- Removing the second "map" results in "ae".
- The total number of deletions required is 4.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Actual Output:**
- The program removes the first "map" resulting in "mapiepie".
- It then removes the "pie" in "mapiepie" resulting in "mae".
- The program does not remove the second "map" because it does not start searching from the beginning of the modified string.

This demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle overlapping occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie". Therefore, the program is incorrect.
