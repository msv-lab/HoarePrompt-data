### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its logic to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Initial Check for 'mapie'**:
   - The function first checks if the string `s` is exactly "mapie". If it is, the function returns 1. However, this check is incorrect because removing just one character from "mapie" (e.g., changing it to "mape" or "maie") would suffice to make it beautiful. The correct behavior should be to remove the minimum number of characters to eliminate all occurrences of "map" and "pie", not just to handle the specific case of "mapie".

2. **Removing 'map' and 'pie'**:
   - The function then enters a loop to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie" from the string `s`. It does this by finding the first occurrence of "map" or "pie", removing it, and incrementing the count `ans` each time an occurrence is removed.
   - This part of the logic is correct in terms of removing the substrings, but it doesn't address the issue with the initial check for "mapie".

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles cases where "map" and "pie" do not exist in the string, returning 0 in such cases.
   - The function also correctly handles cases where multiple occurrences of "map" and "pie" need to be removed.

### Conclusion:

The initial check for `s == 'mapie'` is incorrect and should be removed. The rest of the function correctly implements the logic to remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful by removing all occurrences of "map" and "pie". Since the initial check is the only issue, we can conclude that the provided program is not entirely correct as it stands.
