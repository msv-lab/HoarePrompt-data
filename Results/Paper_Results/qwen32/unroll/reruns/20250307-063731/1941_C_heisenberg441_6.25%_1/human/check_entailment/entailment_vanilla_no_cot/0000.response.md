Correctness: **False**

The given program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Overlapping Substrings**: The function `func_1` removes the first occurrence of "map" and "pie" in each iteration, but it does not correctly handle overlapping substrings. For example, if a string contains "mappie", the function will remove "map" first, resulting in "ppie", then remove "pie", but the correct minimum removal should be 2 (removing "map" or "pie" entirely).

2. **Inefficient String Manipulation**: The program repeatedly modifies the string `s` by slicing and concatenating, which is inefficient and can lead to incorrect results if not handled properly.

3. **Special Case Handling**: The function incorrectly handles the special case `s == 'mapie'` by returning 1, which is not a general solution.

To fix these issues, a more efficient approach would be to use dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to find the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie" without leaving any overlapping substrings. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    # Dynamic programming approach to find the minimum deletions
    n = len(s)
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1]
        if i >= 3:
            if s[i - 3:i] == "map":
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 3] + 1)
            if s[i - 3:i] == "pie":
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 3] + 1)
    
    return dp[n]

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
```

This version uses a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum deletions required to make the first `i` characters of the string beautiful. It checks for the substrings "map" and "pie" and updates the `dp` array accordingly.
