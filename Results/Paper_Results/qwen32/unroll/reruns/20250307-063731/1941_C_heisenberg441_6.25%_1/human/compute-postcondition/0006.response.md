To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to analyze the condition in the loop head.

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while s.find('pie') != -1:
```
This means the loop will execute if the substring `'pie'` is found in the string `s` (i.e., `s.find('pie')` returns an index other than `-1`).

Given the state right before the loop:
- `s` is a string with all occurrences of `'map'` removed.
- `ans` is the number of times `'map'` was found and removed from `s`.

To ensure the loop can execute at least once, `s` must contain the substring `'pie'`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Relevant Variable:** The only variable in the loop head is `s`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution:** The loop will execute if `s.find('pie') != -1`, meaning `'pie'` must be present in `s`.
3. **Current State of `s`:** `s` has all occurrences of `'map'` removed, but there is no information about the presence of `'pie'`.

### Required Adjustment:
To make sure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `s` contains the substring `'pie'`. This can be done by modifying the initial state of `s` to include `'pie'`.

### Final State:
State: **`s` is a string with all occurrences of 'map' removed and must contain the substring 'pie', `ans` is the number of times 'map' was found and removed from `s`.**

This ensures that the condition `s.find('pie') != -1` is satisfied, allowing the `while` loop to execute at least once.
