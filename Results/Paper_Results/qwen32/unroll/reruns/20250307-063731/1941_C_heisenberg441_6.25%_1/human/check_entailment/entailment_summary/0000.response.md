Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by removing occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" from the input string `s` and counting the number of removals. However, there are several issues with this approach:

1. **Handling Overlapping Substrings:** The program removes substrings "map" and "pie" one at a time without considering the possibility of overlapping substrings. For example, in the string "pmapie", the program will first remove "map" resulting in "pie", and then remove "pie", totaling 2 removals. However, the optimal solution would be to remove the "pie" substring first, resulting in only 1 removal.

2. **Inefficient Substring Replacement:** The program uses `s.find()` and string slicing to remove substrings, which is not efficient for large strings. Each removal involves creating a new string, which can be costly in terms of time complexity.

3. **Special Case Handling:** The program includes a special case for the string "mapie", which is incorrect. The string "mapie" should be handled in the same way as other strings, and removing "pie" would result in 1 removal, not 2.

Given these issues, the program does not always produce the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **False**
