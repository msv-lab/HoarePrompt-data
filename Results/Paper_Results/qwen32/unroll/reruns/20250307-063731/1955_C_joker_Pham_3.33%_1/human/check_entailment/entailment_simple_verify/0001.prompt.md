You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem involves a series of attacks on a list of ships arranged in a sequence. The Kraken alternates between attacking the first and the last ship until it either runs out of attacks or all ships have been sunk. The goal is to determine how many ships are sunk after a given number of attacks.

### Program Analysis
The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes the number of ships `n`, the number of attacks `k`, and a list `a` representing the durability of each ship. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: The pointers `l` and `r` are initialized to the start and end of the list, respectively. The variable `sunks` is initialized to count the number of ships that have sunk.

2. **Loop**: The loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r` and `k` is greater than 0.
   - **Single Ship Case**: If `l` equals `r`, it means there's only one ship left. If the remaining attacks `k` are greater than or equal to the durability of this ship, the ship is sunk, and the loop breaks.
   - **Two Ships Case**: If the durability of the first ship (`a[l]`) is less than or equal to the durability of the last ship (`a[r]`):
     - If `k` is greater than or equal to twice the durability of the first ship, the first ship is sunk, and the durability of the last ship is reduced by the durability of the first ship. If the last ship's durability becomes zero, it is sunk.
     - If `k` is exactly one less than twice the durability of the first ship, the first ship is sunk, and the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, the loop breaks.
   - If the durability of the last ship is less than the durability of the first ship, a similar process is followed but with the roles of the first and last ships reversed.

3. **Return**: The function returns the number of ships that have sunk.

### Issues in the Program
The provided code has several issues:
- **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Attacks**: The program does not correctly handle the remaining attacks after sinking a ship. For example, if a ship's durability is reduced but not entirely sunk, the remaining attacks should still be considered.
- **Inefficient Handling of Large `k`**: The code does not efficiently handle large values of `k` (up to \(10^{15}\)). It attempts to decrement `k` in a loop, which would be computationally expensive.
- **Incorrect Break Conditions**: The conditions for breaking out of the loop are not correctly set up to handle all edge cases, such as when `k` is exactly enough to sink a ship but not enough to start attacking the next one.

### Correctness
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all edge cases and input sizes. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
