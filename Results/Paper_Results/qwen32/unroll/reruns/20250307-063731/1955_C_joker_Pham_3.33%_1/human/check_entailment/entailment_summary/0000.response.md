Reasoning:  
The provided execution summary states that the function `func_1` always returns the integer `2` regardless of the input values. However, the problem description and the example outputs indicate that the number of ships sunk should vary based on the input parameters `n`, `k`, and the list `a`. 

For instance, in the first example provided:
- Input: `n=4`, `k=5`, `a=[1, 2, 4, 3]`
- Expected Output: `2` (which matches the execution summary for this specific case, but this is not a general behavior)
- However, if we consider the second example:
- Input: `n=4`, `k=6`, `a=[1, 2, 4, 3]`
- Expected Output: `3` (which does not match the execution summary)

The function's behavior is not consistent with the problem's requirements, as it should correctly compute the number of ships sunk based on the Kraken's attacks, not always return `2`. Therefore, the function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
