The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `l` and the value `n - 1` to the variable `r`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the list `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`.**
