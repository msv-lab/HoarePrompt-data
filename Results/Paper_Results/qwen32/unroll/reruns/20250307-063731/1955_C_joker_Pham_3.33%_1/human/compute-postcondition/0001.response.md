Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `sunks` is 0.**

Natural language: The value of `sunks` has been set to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`) retain their initial values.
