The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (the number of elements in the list `a`), `k` (an integer), and `a` (a list of `n` integers). It processes these inputs to determine a value `sunks` which represents the number of operations performed under certain conditions. The function always returns the integer `2` regardless of the input values.
