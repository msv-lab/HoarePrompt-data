Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.**
