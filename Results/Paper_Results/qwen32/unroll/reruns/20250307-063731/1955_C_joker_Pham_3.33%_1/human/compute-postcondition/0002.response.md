To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to check the condition `l <= r`. The variables `l` and `r` are the only ones that can be adjusted according to the loop head.

Given:
- `l` is 0
- `r` is `n - 1`

The condition `l <= r` will be true if `0 <= n - 1`. This inequality holds as long as `n` is at least 1. Since we are given that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5`, the condition `l <= r` is already satisfied.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state of `l` and `r` for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `sunks` is 0**
