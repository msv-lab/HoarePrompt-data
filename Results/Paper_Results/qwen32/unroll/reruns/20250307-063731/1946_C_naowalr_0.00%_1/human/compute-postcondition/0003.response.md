The function `func_1` accepts several parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree; `k`, an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that `1 <= k < n`; `adj`, a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree; `L` and `R`, integers representing the lower and upper bounds for binary search (initially 1 and 100001, respectively); `numCuts`, an integer representing the number of cuts made during the DFS; and `leftover`, an integer representing the size of the remaining component after DFS.

The function performs operations based on these parameters and returns an integer value.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, `adj`, `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, and `leftover`. It performs operations to determine a value based on these inputs and returns an integer.**
