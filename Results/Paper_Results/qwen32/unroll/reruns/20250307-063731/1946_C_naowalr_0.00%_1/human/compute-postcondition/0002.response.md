Output State: **`n`, `k`, `adj`, `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, `leftover`, `t` are as per the last iteration of the loop. Specifically, `n` and `k` are the values read from the last line of input, `adj` is the adjacency list constructed for the last tree, `L` is the final lower bound determined by the binary search in the last iteration, `R` is the final upper bound determined by the binary search in the last iteration, `numCuts` is the number of cuts made during the DFS in the last iteration, `leftover` is the size of the remaining component after DFS in the last iteration, and `t` is the total number of test cases which remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms: After all iterations, the variables will reflect the state of the last test case processed. The adjacency list `adj` will correspond to the last tree, and `L` will be the final result printed for that test case, which is the maximum size of the smallest component after making at most `k` cuts.
