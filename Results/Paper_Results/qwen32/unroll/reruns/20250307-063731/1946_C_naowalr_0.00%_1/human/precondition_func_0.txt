n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, k is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, adj is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, L and R are integers representing the lower and upper bounds for binary search (initially 1 and 100001, respectively), numCuts is an integer representing the number of cuts made during the DFS, and leftover is an integer representing the size of the remaining component after DFS.
