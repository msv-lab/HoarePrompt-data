The provided code snippet reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer `t` is not related to any of the variables mentioned in the initial state (`n`, `k`, `adj`, `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, `leftover`). Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, `adj`, `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, and `leftover` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, `adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `L` and `R` are integers representing the lower and upper bounds for binary search (initially 1 and 100001, respectively), `numCuts` is an integer representing the number of cuts made during the DFS, `leftover` is an integer representing the size of the remaining component after DFS, `t` is an integer read from the standard input.**
