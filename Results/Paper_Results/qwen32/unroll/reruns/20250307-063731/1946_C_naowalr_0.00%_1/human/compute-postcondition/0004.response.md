Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a tree represented by its number of vertices `n` and its adjacency list `adj`, and an integer `k` representing the number of edges to be removed. For each test case, it performs a binary search to determine the maximum possible size `L` of the remaining connected component after removing `k` edges. The function prints this value `L` for each test case.**
