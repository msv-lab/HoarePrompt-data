### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Construction and Rooting**:
   - The `Tree` class is correctly initialized with `n` vertices.
   - The `add_edge` method correctly adds undirected edges between vertices.
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method roots the tree at vertex 0, updating each vertex's parent and calculating the subtree sizes correctly.

2. **Component Analysis**:
   - `func_1` and `func_2` are essentially the same function, both performing a post-order traversal of the tree to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree.
   - These functions correctly update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex based on its children, ensuring that the number of good components and the total size of the remaining parts are calculated accurately.

3. **Feasibility Check**:
   - `func_3` checks if it's possible to remove `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices. It correctly evaluates the conditions based on the results from `func_1`/`func_2`.

4. **Binary Search for Maximum `x`**:
   - `func_4` performs a binary search over the possible values of `x` (from 1 to `n`) to find the maximum `x` for which `func_3` returns `True`.
   - The binary search is correctly implemented to narrow down the maximum feasible `x`.

5. **Main Function**:
   - `func_5` reads the input for each test case, constructs the tree, roots it, and calls `func_4` to determine the maximum `x` for the given `n` and `k`.
   - The result is printed for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least `x`. All functions work together as intended based on the problem description and the provided execution summaries.

### Correctness:
**True**
