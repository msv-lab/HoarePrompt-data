### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the provided problem description, the code, and the function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find the maximum number \( x \) such that after removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree with \( n \) vertices, each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Tree Representation**:
   - The `Tree` class likely encapsulates the tree structure, including vertices and edges.
   - Each vertex has attributes like `children`, `good_components`, and `remaining_size`.

2. **Functions**:
   - `func_1` and `func_2`: These functions perform a post-order traversal of the tree to compute the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree.
   - `func_3`: This function checks if it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges such that each remaining component has at least \( x \) vertices.
   - `func_4`: This function performs a binary search to find the maximum \( x \) that satisfies the condition.
   - `func_5`: This function reads input, constructs the tree, roots it, and prints the result.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The program performs a binary search on the possible values of \( x \) (from 1 to \( n \)).
   - For each mid value in the binary search, it uses `func_3` to check if it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges such that each remaining component has at least \( x \) vertices.
   - The binary search narrows down the maximum \( x \) that satisfies the condition.

#### Function Summaries:
- `func_5` reads input, constructs the tree, roots it, and prints the result. The summary provided is mostly accurate, but it doesn't cover the binary search aspect or the detailed checks performed by `func_3`.

#### Detailed Evaluation:
- **Tree Construction and Rooting**:
  - The tree is constructed using input edges.
  - The tree is rooted at vertex 0 using `root_tree_non_recursive`, ensuring that the traversal functions can correctly compute subtree properties.

- **Traversal Functions (`func_1` and `func_2`)**:
  - Both functions perform a post-order traversal of the tree.
  - They accumulate `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each subtree.
  - The logic for updating `good_components` and `remaining_size` seems correct based on the problem requirements.

- **Condition Check (`func_3`)**:
  - This function checks if the number of good components is greater than \( k \) or if it equals \( k \) and the remaining size is at least \( x \).
  - The logic here is consistent with the problem's requirements.

- **Binary Search (`func_4`)**:
  - The binary search is correctly implemented to find the maximum \( x \).
  - The search range is from 1 to \( n \), which covers all possible values of \( x \).

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the algorithm to find the maximum \( x \) such that after removing exactly \( k \) edges, each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices. The binary search, tree traversal, and condition checks are all correctly implemented.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
