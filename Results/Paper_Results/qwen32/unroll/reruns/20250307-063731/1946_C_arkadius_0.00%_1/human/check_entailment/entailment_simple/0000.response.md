### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number \( x \) such that after removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree, each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices. Let's break down the logic and verify if the program correctly implements this solution.

1. **Tree Representation:**
   - The tree is represented using a `TreeNode` class, where each node stores its edges, children, subtree size, parent, the number of good components, and the remaining size after processing.
   - The `Tree` class initializes the vertices and provides methods to add edges and to root the tree.

2. **Tree Rooting:**
   - The tree is rooted using a non-recursive approach (`root_tree_non_recursive`), ensuring that each node has its parent and children correctly set, and the subtree size is calculated.

3. **Component Calculation:**
   - `func_1` and `func_2` are used to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree after processing each node and its children.
   - `func_1` uses a stack to perform an iterative post-order traversal of the tree, updating the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each node.
   - `func_2` performs a recursive post-order traversal to achieve the same goal.

4. **Feasibility Check:**
   - `func_3` checks if it is possible to remove \( k \) edges such that each remaining component has at least \( x \) vertices.
   - It uses the results from `func_1` to determine if the number of good components is greater than \( k \) or if it is equal to \( k \) and the remaining size is at least \( x \).

5. **Binary Search:**
   - `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum \( x \) that satisfies the condition.
   - It uses `func_3` to check the feasibility of each candidate \( x \) and adjusts the search range accordingly.

6. **Main Function:**
   - `func_5` reads the input, constructs the tree, roots it, and then calls `func_4` to find and print the maximum \( x \).

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum \( x \) by leveraging a binary search and a post-order traversal of the tree to count the number of good components and the remaining size. The use of both iterative and recursive methods to calculate the components suggests that the logic is robust and well-tested.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the program appears to handle the input correctly and produce the expected output.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
