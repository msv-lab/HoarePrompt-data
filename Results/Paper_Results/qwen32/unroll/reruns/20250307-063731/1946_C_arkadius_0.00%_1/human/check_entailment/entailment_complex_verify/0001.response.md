To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program, let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, the annotations, and the original assessment.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to find the maximum number \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges from a tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least \( x \).

### Program Analysis

#### Tree Representation
The tree is represented using a `Tree` class where each node has attributes like `children`, `good_components`, and `remaining_size`. This representation seems appropriate for the problem.

#### Functions
- **`func_1` and `func_2`**: These functions traverse the tree in post-order to compute the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree. The annotations confirm that these functions correctly update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` based on the children of each node.
- **`func_3`**: This function checks if it's possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges such that each remaining component has at least \( x \) vertices. The annotations state that this function correctly evaluates the condition.
- **`func_4`**: This function performs a binary search to find the maximum \( x \) that satisfies the condition. The annotations confirm that the binary search correctly narrows down the maximum \( x \).
- **`func_5`**: This function reads input, constructs the tree, roots it, and prints the result. The annotations confirm that the tree is correctly rooted and the edges are added as specified.

### Correctness Check

1. **Binary Search in `func_4`**:
   - The binary search is correctly implemented to find the maximum \( x \) such that `func_3` returns `True`.
   - The search range is from 1 to \( n \), which is appropriate.

2. **Tree Traversal in `func_1` and `func_2`**:
   - Both functions traverse the tree in post-order, ensuring that all children are processed before the parent.
   - The annotations confirm that the functions correctly update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each node.

3. **Condition Check in `func_3`**:
   - The function checks if the number of good components is greater than \( k \) or if it is equal to \( k \) and the remaining size is at least \( x \).
   - The annotations confirm that the function correctly evaluates the condition.

4. **Tree Construction and Rooting**:
   - The tree is correctly constructed and rooted at vertex 0.
   - The edges are added as specified in the input.

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly implements the algorithm to find the maximum number \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least \( x \). The annotations and the step-by-step analysis confirm that the program behaves as expected.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
