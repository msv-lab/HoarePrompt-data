Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n; `tree` is an instance of the Tree class with `n` vertices.**

Explanation: The variable `tree` is now an instance of the `Tree` class initialized with `n` vertices. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they were part of the initial state.
