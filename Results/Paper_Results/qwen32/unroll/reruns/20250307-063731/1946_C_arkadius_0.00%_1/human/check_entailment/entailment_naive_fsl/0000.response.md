Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum number `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least `x`. However, there are a few issues with the implementation that need to be addressed:

1. **Tree Structure Definition**: The code references a `Tree` class which is not defined in the provided code. The `Tree` class should have methods like `add_edge`, `root_tree_non_recursive`, and properties like `vertices` that are used in the functions. Without this class definition, we cannot verify the correctness of the code.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The code does not handle edge cases explicitly. For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 1`, the tree is a single edge, and removing that edge results in two components of size 1. The code should correctly handle such cases.

3. **Indexing and Off-by-One Errors**: The code uses `u - 1` and `v - 1` to adjust for 1-based indexing in the input to 0-based indexing in the code. This is correct, but it should be ensured that this conversion is consistent throughout the code.

4. **Postorder Traversal**: The `func_1` function uses a stack to perform a postorder traversal of the tree. The logic seems correct, but it should be verified that the tree is rooted correctly and that all vertices are visited.

5. **Binary Search Logic**: The `func_4` function uses binary search to find the maximum `x`. The binary search logic seems correct, but the correctness of the `func_3` function, which checks if a given `x` is feasible, is crucial. If `func_3` is incorrect, the binary search will not yield the correct result.

To verify the correctness, we need a complete and correct implementation of the `Tree` class and a thorough test suite that checks all edge cases. Given the current code, we cannot be certain that it handles all cases correctly, especially without the `Tree` class definition.

### Example of a Potential Issue:
Consider the input:
```
1
2 1
1 2
```
The correct output should be `1` because removing the only edge results in two components of size 1. The current code should handle this correctly, but without a full implementation of the `Tree` class, we cannot be certain.

Since we cannot verify the correctness of the code due to missing parts and potential issues, the answer is **False**.
