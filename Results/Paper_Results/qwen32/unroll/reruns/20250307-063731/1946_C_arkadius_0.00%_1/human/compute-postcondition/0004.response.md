To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the method `root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)` on the `tree` object. This method is likely performing some operation to root the tree at vertex `0` and possibly setting the parent of the root to `-1`, which is a common convention to indicate that the node has no parent (since vertices are typically indexed from `0` to `n-1`).

Given the initial state, the variables `n` and `k` are not directly affected by the method call, so they remain unchanged. The `tree` object will have its internal state modified based on the method's implementation, but without the exact implementation details, we can only infer some general changes.

The method `root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)` will likely set the root of the tree to vertex `0` and update the parent pointers of the other vertices accordingly. Since the exact changes depend on the internal structure of the `Tree` class and the method implementation, we can state that the tree will be rooted at vertex `0` with appropriate parent pointers set.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n; `tree` is an instance of the Tree class with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges, now rooted at vertex `0` with updated parent pointers.**
