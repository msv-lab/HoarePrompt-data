Functionality: **The function `func_3` accepts a parameter `tree` which is an object representing a tree with `n` vertices, `n` which is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` which is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and `x` which is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component. The function returns `True` if it is possible to remove `k` edges from the tree such that each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices. Otherwise, it returns `False`.**
