The loop provided is designed to read `n-1` edges from the input, where `n` is the number of vertices in the tree. Each edge is represented by two integers, `u` and `v`, which are then used to add an edge between vertices `u-1` and `v-1` in the `tree` object. Since the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, it will read and process `n-1` edges.

After all the iterations of the loop, the `tree` object will have all the edges added to it, forming a tree structure with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges. The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged throughout the loop as they are not modified within the loop body.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n; `tree` is an instance of the Tree class with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges added to it.**
