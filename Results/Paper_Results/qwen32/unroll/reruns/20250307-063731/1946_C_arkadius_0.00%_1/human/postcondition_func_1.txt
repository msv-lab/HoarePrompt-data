The function processes a tree structure starting from a given vertex `v` and calculates the number of good components in its subtrees, where a good component is defined as having a size of at least `x`. It also calculates the total size of the remaining parts of the subtrees that do not meet the size threshold `x`. The function returns a tuple containing the count of good components and the size of the remaining parts.
