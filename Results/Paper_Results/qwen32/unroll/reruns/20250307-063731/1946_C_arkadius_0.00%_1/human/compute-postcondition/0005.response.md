To determine what will be printed when the `print(func_4(tree, n, k))` statement executes, we need to understand the context and the function `func_4`. However, the function `func_4` is not defined in the given initial state, so we can only infer based on the provided information about the variables and the tree structure.

Given:
- `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree.
- `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that \(1 \leq k < n\).
- `tree` is an instance of the `Tree` class with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges, now rooted at vertex `0` with updated parent pointers.

Since `func_4` is not defined, we can only provide a general description of what might be printed based on the typical operations one might perform on a tree.

Typically, a function named `func_4` operating on a tree and taking `n` and `k` as parameters might perform operations such as:
- Removing `k` edges from the tree.
- Calculating some property of the tree after removing `k` edges.
- Returning a specific value or structure based on the modified tree.

Without the exact definition of `func_4`, we can only hypothesize that the function might return a specific value or structure related to the tree after `k` edges have been removed.

For the sake of providing a precise answer based on the given information, let's assume `func_4` returns the number of connected components in the tree after removing `k` edges. This is a common operation when dealing with trees and edge removal.

Given this assumption:
- If `k` edges are removed from a tree with `n` vertices, the number of connected components will be `k + 1`.

Therefore, the output could be `k + 1`.

However, since the exact behavior of `func_4` is not specified, the most precise description we can provide based on the given information is:

Output: **result of func_4(tree, n, k) (where func_4 is a function that operates on the tree and returns a value based on the number of vertices n and edges to be removed k)**

If we assume `func_4` returns the number of connected components, then:

Output: **k + 1 (assuming func_4 returns the number of connected components after removing k edges from the tree)**
