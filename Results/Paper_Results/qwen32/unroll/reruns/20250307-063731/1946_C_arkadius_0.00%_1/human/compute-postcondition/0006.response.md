Functionality: **The function `func_5` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of vertices in a tree, and `k`, an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, with the constraint that 1 <= k < n. The function returns the resulting number of connected components in the tree after removing `k` edges.**
