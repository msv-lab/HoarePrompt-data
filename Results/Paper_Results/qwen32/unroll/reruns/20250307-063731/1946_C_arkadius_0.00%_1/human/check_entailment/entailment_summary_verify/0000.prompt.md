You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function `func_5` reads an integer `n` representing the number of vertices and an integer `k` representing the number of edges to be removed from a tree. It constructs a tree with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges, roots the tree, and then calculates and prints the number of connected components in the tree after removing `k` edges.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum number `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least `x`. However, there are a few issues with the implementation that need to be addressed:

1. **Tree Structure Definition**: The code references a `Tree` class which is not defined in the provided code. The `Tree` class should have methods like `add_edge`, `root_tree_non_recursive`, and properties like `vertices` that are used in the functions. Without this class definition, we cannot verify the correctness of the code.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The code does not handle edge cases explicitly. For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 1`, the tree is a single edge, and removing that edge results in two components of size 1. The code should correctly handle such cases.

3. **Indexing and Off-by-One Errors**: The code uses `u - 1` and `v - 1` to adjust for 1-based indexing in the input to 0-based indexing in the code. This is correct, but it should be ensured that this conversion is consistent throughout the code.

4. **Postorder Traversal**: The `func_1` function uses a stack to perform a postorder traversal of the tree. The logic seems correct, but it should be verified that the tree is rooted correctly and that all vertices are visited.

5. **Binary Search Logic**: The `func_4` function uses binary search to find the maximum `x`. The binary search logic seems correct, but the correctness of the `func_3` function, which checks if a given `x` is feasible, is crucial. If `func_3` is incorrect, the binary search will not yield the correct result.

To verify the correctness, we need a complete and correct implementation of the `Tree` class and a thorough test suite that checks all edge cases. Given the current code, we cannot be certain that it handles all cases correctly, especially without the `Tree` class definition.

### Example of a Potential Issue:
Consider the input:
```
1
2 1
1 2
```
The correct output should be `1` because removing the only edge results in two components of size 1. The current code should handle this correctly, but without a full implementation of the `Tree` class, we cannot be certain.

Since we cannot verify the correctness of the code due to missing parts and potential issues, the answer is **False**.
