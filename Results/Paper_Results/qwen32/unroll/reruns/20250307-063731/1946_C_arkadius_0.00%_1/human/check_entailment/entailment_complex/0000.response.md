### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges from a tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least \( x \).

Let's break down the functions and their roles:

1. **TreeNode Class**:
   - Represents a node in the tree.
   - Contains attributes to store edges, children, subtree size, parent, good components, and remaining size.
   - Provides methods for string representation.

2. **Tree Class**:
   - Represents the entire tree.
   - Contains methods to add edges and root the tree (both recursive and non-recursive versions).

3. **func_1**:
   - Uses a stack to perform a post-order traversal of the tree.
   - Updates `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each node based on its children.
   - Returns the `good_components` and `remaining_size` of the root node.

4. **func_2**:
   - Recursively processes the tree to update `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each node.
   - Returns the `good_components` and `remaining_size` of the current node.

5. **func_3**:
   - Uses the results from `func_1` to determine if it's possible to remove \( k \) edges such that each remaining component has at least \( x \) vertices.
   - Returns `True` if the condition is met, otherwise `False`.

6. **func_4**:
   - Uses binary search to find the maximum \( x \) for which `func_3` returns `True`.
   - Returns the largest \( x \).

7. **func_5**:
   - Reads input for a single test case, constructs the tree, roots it, and then uses `func_4` to find and print the result.

### Analysis:

- **TreeNode and Tree Classes**: These classes are correctly implemented to represent and manipulate the tree structure.
- **func_1 and func_2**: Both functions are responsible for calculating `good_components` and `remaining_size`. `func_1` uses an iterative approach with a stack, while `func_2` uses recursion. Both should produce the same results.
- **func_3**: This function checks if the tree can be split into components of at least size \( x \) by removing exactly \( k \) edges. It correctly uses the results from `func_1`.
- **func_4**: This function correctly uses binary search to find the maximum \( x \) for which `func_3` returns `True`.
- **func_5**: This function correctly reads input, constructs the tree, roots it, and computes the result using `func_4`.

The overall logic and implementation of the program are consistent with the problem statement and the provided example. Therefore, the program should correctly solve the problem for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
