### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the program based on the provided problem description, code, and annotations.

**Tree Representation and Functions:**
- The `Tree` class represents the tree structure with vertices, edges, and additional attributes (`good_components` and `remaining_size`).
- `TreeNode` class represents each vertex with its edges, children, and other attributes.

**Functions:**
1. **`func_1` and `func_2`:** Both functions traverse the tree in a post-order manner to compute the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree. The annotations confirm that the stack-based approach in `func_1` and the recursive approach in `func_2` are correctly implemented and update the attributes accordingly.
   
2. **`func_3`:** This function uses the results from `func_1` to determine if it's possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `x` vertices. The annotations confirm that the logic for checking the number of good components and the remaining size is correct.
   
3. **`func_4`:** This function performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition. The annotations confirm that the binary search correctly narrows down the maximum `x` by leveraging the results from `func_3`.

4. **`func_5`:** This function reads input, constructs the tree, roots it, and prints the result. The annotations confirm that the tree is correctly rooted and the edges are added as specified.

**Algorithm:**
- The program uses a binary search on the possible values of `x` (from 1 to `n`).
- For each `mid` value in the binary search, it checks if it's possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `mid` vertices using `func_3`.
- The binary search narrows down the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.

**Implementation Details:**
- The tree is rooted at vertex 0.
- The tree traversal in `func_1` and `func_2` is post-order, ensuring that all children are processed before the parent.
- The binary search in `func_4` correctly narrows down the maximum `x`.

**Annotations:**
- The annotations for each function provide a clear state of the program before and after the function call, and they confirm the correctness of the logic and state updates.

**Conclusion:**
- Based on the analysis and the annotations, the program correctly implements the algorithm to find the maximum number `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least `x`.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final: **True**
