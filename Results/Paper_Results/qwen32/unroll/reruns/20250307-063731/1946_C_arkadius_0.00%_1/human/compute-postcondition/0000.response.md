The code snippet reads two integers from the input, representing the number of vertices `n` in the tree and the number of edges `k` to be removed, such that `1 <= k < n`. After the execution of the code, the variables `n` and `k` are assigned the values read from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n.**
