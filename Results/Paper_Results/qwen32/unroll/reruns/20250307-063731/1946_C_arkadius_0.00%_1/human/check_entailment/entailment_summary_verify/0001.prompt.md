You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

                if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:

    return (tree.vertices[s].good_components, tree.vertices[s].remaining_size)

#Function 2:
def func_2(tree: Tree, v: int, x: int) -> (int, int):
    good_components = 0
    remaining_size = 1
    for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
        (good_components_subtree, remaining_size_subtree) = func_2(tree, u, x)

        else:

    return (good_components, remaining_size)

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function `func_5` reads an integer `n` representing the number of vertices and an integer `k` representing the number of edges to be removed from a tree. It constructs a tree with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges, roots the tree, and then calculates and prints the number of connected components in the tree after removing `k` edges.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze if it correctly solves the problem described. The program is designed to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from a tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Tree Representation**:
   - The program uses a `Tree` class to represent the tree structure.
   - Each node in the tree has a list of children and additional attributes (`good_components` and `remaining_size`).

2. **Functions**:
   - `func_1` and `func_2`: These functions traverse the tree and compute the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree.
   - `func_3`: This function checks if it's possible to remove exactly k edges such that each remaining component has at least x vertices.
   - `func_4`: This function performs a binary search to find the maximum x that satisfies the condition.
   - `func_5`: This function reads input, constructs the tree, roots it, and prints the result.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The program uses a binary search on the possible values of x (from 1 to n).
   - For each mid value in the binary search, it checks if it's possible to remove exactly k edges such that each remaining component has at least mid vertices using `func_3`.
   - The binary search narrows down the maximum x that satisfies the condition.

4. **Implementation Details**:
   - The tree is rooted at vertex 0.
   - The tree traversal in `func_1` and `func_2` is post-order, which ensures that all children are processed before the parent.
   - The binary search in `func_4` correctly narrows down the maximum x.

### Correctness Check

- The binary search in `func_4` ensures that we find the maximum x efficiently.
- The functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly traverse the tree and compute the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree.
- The function `func_3` correctly checks if the condition is satisfied for a given x.
- The tree is correctly rooted and the edges are added as specified.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the algorithm to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
