To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze if it correctly solves the problem described. The program is designed to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from a tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Tree Representation**:
   - The program uses a `Tree` class to represent the tree structure.
   - Each node in the tree has a list of children and additional attributes (`good_components` and `remaining_size`).

2. **Functions**:
   - `func_1` and `func_2`: These functions traverse the tree and compute the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree.
   - `func_3`: This function checks if it's possible to remove exactly k edges such that each remaining component has at least x vertices.
   - `func_4`: This function performs a binary search to find the maximum x that satisfies the condition.
   - `func_5`: This function reads input, constructs the tree, roots it, and prints the result.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The program uses a binary search on the possible values of x (from 1 to n).
   - For each mid value in the binary search, it checks if it's possible to remove exactly k edges such that each remaining component has at least mid vertices using `func_3`.
   - The binary search narrows down the maximum x that satisfies the condition.

4. **Implementation Details**:
   - The tree is rooted at vertex 0.
   - The tree traversal in `func_1` and `func_2` is post-order, which ensures that all children are processed before the parent.
   - The binary search in `func_4` correctly narrows down the maximum x.

### Correctness Check

- The binary search in `func_4` ensures that we find the maximum x efficiently.
- The functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly traverse the tree and compute the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree.
- The function `func_3` correctly checks if the condition is satisfied for a given x.
- The tree is correctly rooted and the edges are added as specified.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the algorithm to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
