### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided functions and their behavior to determine if they correctly solve the problem.

#### Function 1: `func_1(n, p)`
- **Purpose**: This function takes an initial number of players `n` and a list of positions `p` to be kicked out in each round. It simulates the rounds of the game until no more players can be kicked out.
- **Logic**:
  - The function enters a loop that continues as long as `n` (the current number of players) is greater than or equal to the smallest position in `p`.
  - In each iteration, it calculates how many players need to be kicked out by counting how many positions in `p` are less than or equal to `n`.
  - It subtracts this count from `n`, effectively removing those players.
  - The loop exits when `n` is less than the smallest position in `p`, meaning no more players can be kicked out.
  - It returns the final number of players remaining, which is the correct count of winners.

#### Function 2: `func_2()`
- **Purpose**: This function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a sequence of positions `p` and a series of queries `qs` representing different initial numbers of players.
- **Logic**:
  - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads `k` (the length of the sequence `p`), `q` (the number of queries), the sequence `p` itself, and the list of queries `qs`.
  - For each query `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` to determine the number of winners and appends the result to `res`.
  - It prints the results for each query in the format specified by the problem.

### Issues in the Provided Code:
- **Output Timing**: The line `print(' '.join(map(str, res)))` inside the loop over `qs` is incorrect. It should print the result for each query immediately after processing it, rather than printing the entire list of results at once after all queries for a test case are processed.
  
### Corrected Output Timing:
The corrected version of `func_2()` should print the result for each query immediately after processing it. Here's the corrected version:

```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        k, q = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for n in qs:
            result = func_1(n, p)
            print(result, end=' ')
        print()  # Newline after each test case
```

### Conclusion:
The logic in `func_1` is correct, but the output timing in `func_2` is incorrect. Therefore, the given program is not correct as it stands.

**Correctness: False**
