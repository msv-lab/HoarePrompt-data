You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene invented a new game based on an increasing sequence of integers a_1, a_2,
\ldots, a_k .

In this game, initially n players are lined up in a row. In each of the rounds
of this game, the following happens:

  * Nene finds the a_1 -th, a_2 -th, \ldots , a_k -th players in a row. They are kicked out of the game simultaneously. If the i -th player in a row should be kicked out, but there are fewer than i players in a row, they are skipped. 

Once no one is kicked out of the game in some round, all the players that are
still in the game are declared as winners.

For example, consider the game with a=[3, 5] and n=5 players. Let the players
be named player A, player B, \ldots , player E in the order they are lined up
initially. Then,

  * Before the first round, players are lined up as ABCDE. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. These are players C and E. They are kicked out in the first round. 
  * Now players are lined up as ABD. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. The 3 -rd player is player D and there is no 5 -th player in a row. Thus, only player D is kicked out in the second round. 
  * In the third round, no one is kicked out of the game, so the game ends after this round. 
  * Players A and B are declared as the winners. 

Nene has not yet decided how many people would join the game initially. Nene
gave you q integers n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_q and you should answer the following
question for each 1 \le i \le q independently:

  * How many people would be declared as winners if there are n_i players in the game initially? 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 250 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line case contains two integers k and q (1 \le k, q \le 100 ) — the
length of the sequence a and the number of values n_i you should solve this
problem for.

The second line contains k integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k (1\leq
a_1<a_2<\ldots<a_k\leq 100 ) — the sequence a .

The third line contains q integers n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_q (1\leq n_i \leq 100 ).

Output

For each test case, output q integers: the i -th (1\le i \le q ) of them
should be the number of players declared as winners if initially n_i players
join the game.

Note

The first test case was explained in the statement.

In the second test case, when n=1 , the only player stays in the game in the
first round. After that, the game ends and the only player is declared as a
winner.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, p):
    while n >= min(p):
        n -= sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))
    return n

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
            print(' '.join(map(str, res)))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of players `n` and a list of positions `p` of players to be kicked out. It then processes a series of queries `qs`, each representing an initial number of players, and for each query, it calculates and prints the list of players remaining after removing the players at the positions specified in `p`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the program step by step.

### Program Analysis

1. **Function `func_1(n, p)`**:
    - **Purpose**: To determine the number of players remaining after all possible rounds of kicking out players based on the sequence `p`.
    - **Logic**:
        - The function uses a `while` loop that continues as long as `n` (the number of players left) is greater than or equal to the smallest value in `p`.
        - Inside the loop, it calculates the number of players to be kicked out in the current round by summing up `1` for each element `x` in `p` that is less than or equal to `n`.
        - It then subtracts this sum from `n`.
        - The loop continues until no more players can be kicked out (i.e., `n` is less than the smallest value in `p`).
        - The function returns the remaining number of players `n`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
    - **Purpose**: To handle multiple test cases.
    - **Logic**:
        - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
        - For each test case, it reads the values of `k` (length of sequence `p`), `q` (number of values of `n` to process).
        - It reads the sequence `p` and the list of `n` values.
        - For each `n` in the list, it calls `func_1(n, p)` to compute the number of remaining players and appends the result to the `res` list.
        - It prints the results for the current test case.

### Correctness Check

- **Logic of `func_1(n, p)`**:
    - The function correctly implements the logic of the game by iteratively removing players based on the sequence `p`.
    - The condition `n >= min(p)` ensures that the loop only runs as long as there are enough players to potentially be kicked out.
    - The sum `(1 for x in p if x <= n)` correctly counts the number of players to be kicked out in each round.
    - The function correctly returns the number of remaining players after all possible rounds.

- **Logic of `func_2()`**:
    - The function correctly reads and processes multiple test cases.
    - It correctly reads the input values and calls `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in the list.
    - The results are correctly collected and printed for each test case.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It correctly handles multiple test cases, reads input values, computes the number of remaining players, and prints the results.

Therefore, the program is correct.
