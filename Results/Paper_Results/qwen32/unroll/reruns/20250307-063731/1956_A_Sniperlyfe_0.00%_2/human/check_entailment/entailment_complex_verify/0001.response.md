### Reasoning:

Upon reviewing the problem description, the provided program code, and the annotated version of the code, we can systematically evaluate the correctness of the program. Here are the key points:

1. **Function `func_1(n, p)`**:
    - **Purpose**: To determine the number of players remaining after all possible rounds of kicking out players based on the sequence `p`.
    - **Logic**:
        - The function uses a `while` loop to iteratively remove players as long as `n` (the number of players left) is greater than or equal to the smallest value in `p`.
        - Inside the loop, it calculates the number of players to be kicked out in the current round by counting the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`.
        - It then subtracts this count from `n`.
        - The loop continues until no more players can be kicked out (i.e., `n` is less than the smallest value in `p`).
        - The function returns the remaining number of players `n`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
    - **Purpose**: To handle multiple test cases.
    - **Logic**:
        - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
        - For each test case, it reads the values of `k` (length of sequence `p`), `q` (number of values of `n` to process).
        - It reads the sequence `p` and the list of `n` values.
        - For each `n` in the list, it calls `func_1(n, p)` to compute the number of remaining players and appends the result to the `res` list.
        - It prints the results for the current test case.

### Correctness Check

- **Logic of `func_1(n, p)`**:
    - The function correctly implements the logic of the game by iteratively removing players based on the sequence `p`.
    - The condition `n >= min(p)` ensures that the loop only runs as long as there are enough players to potentially be kicked out.
    - The sum `(1 for x in p if x <= n)` correctly counts the number of players to be kicked out in each round.
    - The function correctly returns the number of remaining players after all possible rounds.

- **Logic of `func_2()`**:
    - The function correctly reads and processes multiple test cases.
    - It correctly reads the input values and calls `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in the list.
    - The results are correctly collected and printed for each test case.

### Annotations and State Validation

The annotations provided for the code are accurate and correctly describe the state of the program at key points:
- **Before the function call**: The initial number of players `n` and the sorted list of positions `p` are correctly described.
- **Inside the function**: The state of `n` is described as being reduced to a value less than the smallest position in `p`.
- **After the function call**: The function returns the correct number of remaining players.

### Example Validation

Let's validate the first example provided in the problem description:
- **Input**: `k = 2`, `q = 1`, `p = [3, 5]`, `n = 5`
- **Process**:
    - Initially, `n = 5`.
    - In the first round, players at positions 3 and 5 are kicked out, so `n -= 2` → `n = 3`.
    - In the second round, only the player at position 3 is kicked out, so `n -= 1` → `n = 2`.
    - In the third round, no players are kicked out because `n < 3`.
- **Output**: `n = 2`, which matches the expected result.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It correctly handles multiple test cases, reads input values, computes the number of remaining players, and prints the results. The annotations provided for the code are accurate and support the correctness of the program.

Therefore, the program is correct.
