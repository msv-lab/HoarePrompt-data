To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the program step by step.

### Program Analysis

1. **Function `func_1(n, p)`**:
    - **Purpose**: To determine the number of players remaining after all possible rounds of kicking out players based on the sequence `p`.
    - **Logic**:
        - The function uses a `while` loop that continues as long as `n` (the number of players left) is greater than or equal to the smallest value in `p`.
        - Inside the loop, it calculates the number of players to be kicked out in the current round by summing up `1` for each element `x` in `p` that is less than or equal to `n`.
        - It then subtracts this sum from `n`.
        - The loop continues until no more players can be kicked out (i.e., `n` is less than the smallest value in `p`).
        - The function returns the remaining number of players `n`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
    - **Purpose**: To handle multiple test cases.
    - **Logic**:
        - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
        - For each test case, it reads the values of `k` (length of sequence `p`), `q` (number of values of `n` to process).
        - It reads the sequence `p` and the list of `n` values.
        - For each `n` in the list, it calls `func_1(n, p)` to compute the number of remaining players and appends the result to the `res` list.
        - It prints the results for the current test case.

### Correctness Check

- **Logic of `func_1(n, p)`**:
    - The function correctly implements the logic of the game by iteratively removing players based on the sequence `p`.
    - The condition `n >= min(p)` ensures that the loop only runs as long as there are enough players to potentially be kicked out.
    - The sum `(1 for x in p if x <= n)` correctly counts the number of players to be kicked out in each round.
    - The function correctly returns the number of remaining players after all possible rounds.

- **Logic of `func_2()`**:
    - The function correctly reads and processes multiple test cases.
    - It correctly reads the input values and calls `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in the list.
    - The results are correctly collected and printed for each test case.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It correctly handles multiple test cases, reads input values, computes the number of remaining players, and prints the results.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
