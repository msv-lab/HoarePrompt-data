The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of players `n` and a list of positions `p` of players to be kicked out. It then processes a series of queries `qs`, each representing an initial number of players, and for each query, it calculates and prints the list of players remaining after removing the players at the positions specified in `p`.
