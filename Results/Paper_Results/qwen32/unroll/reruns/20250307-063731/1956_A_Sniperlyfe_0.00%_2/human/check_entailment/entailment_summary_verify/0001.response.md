To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it step-by-step based on the problem description, the code, and the function summaries.

### Problem Description Recap
The game involves a sequence of integers `a` which specifies the positions of players to be removed in each round. Players are removed simultaneously based on these positions. If a position specified in `a` exceeds the current number of players, that position is skipped. The game ends when no more players can be removed. The goal is to determine the number of players remaining after the game ends for different initial numbers of players.

### Program Analysis

#### Function `func_1(n, p)`
- **Purpose**: Determine the number of players remaining after all possible rounds of kicking out players based on the sequence `p`.
- **Logic**:
  - The function uses a `while` loop that continues as long as `n` (the number of players left) is greater than or equal to the smallest value in `p`.
  - Inside the loop, it calculates the number of players to be kicked out in the current round by summing up `1` for each element `x` in `p` that is less than or equal to `n`.
  - It then subtracts this sum from `n`.
  - The loop continues until no more players can be kicked out (i.e., `n` is less than the smallest value in `p`).
  - The function returns the remaining number of players `n`.

#### Function `func_2()`
- **Purpose**: Handle multiple test cases.
- **Logic**:
  - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads the values of `k` (length of sequence `p`), `q` (number of values of `n` to process).
  - It reads the sequence `p` and the list of `n` values.
  - For each `n` in the list, it calls `func_1(n, p)` to compute the number of remaining players and appends the result to the `res` list.
  - It prints the results for the current test case.

### Correctness Check

#### Evaluation of `func_1(n, p)`
- The function correctly implements the logic of the game by iteratively removing players based on the sequence `p`.
- The condition `n >= min(p)` ensures that the loop only runs as long as there are enough players to potentially be kicked out.
- The sum `(1 for x in p if x <= n)` correctly counts the number of players to be kicked out in each round.
- The function correctly returns the number of remaining players after all possible rounds.

#### Evaluation of `func_2()`
- The function correctly reads and processes multiple test cases.
- It correctly reads the input values and calls `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in the list.
- The results are correctly collected and printed for each test case.

### Function Summary
The function summary for `func_2` is accurate. It correctly states that the function reads multiple test cases, processes each test case by calling `func_1` for each `n`, and prints the results.

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It correctly handles multiple test cases, reads input values, computes the number of remaining players, and prints the results.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
