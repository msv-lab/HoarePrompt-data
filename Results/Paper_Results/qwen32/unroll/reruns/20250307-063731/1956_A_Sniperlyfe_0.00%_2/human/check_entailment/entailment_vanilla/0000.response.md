Let's analyze the provided code and the problem description to see if the program is correct.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a sequence of integers `a` which determines which players are kicked out in each round.
   - Initially, there are `n` players lined up.
   - In each round, players at positions `a_1, a_2, ..., a_k` are kicked out if they exist.
   - The process continues until no more players can be kicked out.
   - We need to determine how many players remain after all possible rounds for different initial player counts `n_1, n_2, ..., n_q`.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code has two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_2` reads the input and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of players `n` for which we need to find the number of winners.
   - For each `n`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` where `p` is the sequence `a`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1` takes two arguments: `n` (number of players) and `p` (sequence `a`).
   - It repeatedly subtracts the number of players that can be kicked out in each round from `n` until no more players can be kicked out.
   - The condition for the loop is `n >= min(p)`, which ensures that there are enough players to potentially kick out someone.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates the number of players that can be kicked out in the current round using a generator expression `sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))`.
   - It continues this process until no more players can be kicked out.

4. **Correctness of the Implementation:**
   - The logic in `func_1` seems correct for simulating the game rounds and counting the remaining players.
   - The use of `min(p)` ensures that the loop only continues as long as there are enough players to consider kicking out someone.
   - The generator expression correctly counts the number of players that can be kicked out in each round.
   - The results for each `n` are collected in a list `res` and printed at the end of processing each test case.

5. **Output Handling:**
   - The output for each test case is printed after processing all `n_i` values for that test case.
   - The output format matches the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly simulates the game as described in the problem statement and produces the correct output for the given example inputs.

**Correctness: True**
