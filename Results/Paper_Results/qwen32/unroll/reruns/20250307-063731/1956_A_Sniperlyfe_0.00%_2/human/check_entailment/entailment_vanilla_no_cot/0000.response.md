Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed to correctly solve the problem:

1. **Output Timing**: The program prints the results after processing each `n` in `qs`, which means it prints partial results for each `n` instead of printing all results for a test case at once.

2. **Function Logic**: The logic in `func_1` is incorrect. The function should simulate the process of removing players as described in the problem statement until no more players can be removed.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the list `p` contains indices that are larger than the number of players left in the game.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, p):
    players = list(range(1, n + 1))
    while True:
        remove = set()
        for index in p:
            if index - 1 < len(players):
                remove.add(players[index - 1])
        if not remove:
            break
        players = [player for player in players if player not in remove]
    return len(players)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))

# Uncomment the following line to run the function
# func_2()
```

In this corrected version:
- `func_1` simulates the game by maintaining a list of players and removing the players at the specified indices until no more players can be removed.
- The results for all `n` in `qs` are collected and printed at once for each test case.
