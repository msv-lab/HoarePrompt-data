Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n`, a non-negative integer representing the initial number of players in the game, and `p`, a list of integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round. The function processes these inputs and returns the final list of players remaining after all specified positions have been removed.**
