To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to understand what the loop does in each iteration. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. For each iteration of the loop (controlled by `t`), the following inputs are read:
   - `k` and `q`: two integers.
   - `p`: a list of `k` integers.
   - `qs`: a list of integers.

2. An empty list `res` is initialized to store results.

3. For each integer `n` in `qs`, the function `func_1(n, p)` is called, and the result is appended to `res`.

4. After processing all integers in `qs`, the list `res` is printed.

The loop iterates `t` times, but the only variables that change within the loop are `k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`, and `res`. The initial variables `n` (the number of players) and `p` (positions of players to be kicked out in each round) in the precondition are not directly affected by the loop's body unless `p` is reassigned within the loop, which it is.

Given that `p` is reassigned in each iteration of the loop, the final value of `p` will be the value it was assigned in the last iteration of the loop. The value of `n` remains unchanged unless it is reassigned within the loop, which it is not.

The output state will reflect the final values of `n` and `p` from the initial state, as they are not modified within the loop.

Output State: **`n` is the same non-negative integer representing the initial number of players in the game, and `p` is the list of integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in the last round.**
