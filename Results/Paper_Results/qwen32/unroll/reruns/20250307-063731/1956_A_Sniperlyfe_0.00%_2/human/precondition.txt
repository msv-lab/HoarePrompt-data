n is a list of integers representing the number of players for each test case, and p is a list of integers representing the positions of the players to be kicked out in each round. Additionally, there is an implicit input k (the length of p) and q (the length of n) which are not directly passed to the function but are part of the overall input structure as described in the problem statement.
