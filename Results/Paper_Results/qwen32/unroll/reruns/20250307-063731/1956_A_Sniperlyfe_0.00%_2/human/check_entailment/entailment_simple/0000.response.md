### Reasoning:

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. The main function `func_2` reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results. The function `func_1` is responsible for calculating the number of players remaining after the game ends for a given initial number of players `n` and the list of positions `p`.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the program:

1. **Function `func_1(n, p)`**:
   - **Purpose**: To determine the number of players remaining after the game ends for a given initial number of players `n` and the list of positions `p`.
   - **Logic**:
     - The function enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `n` (the number of players remaining) is greater than or equal to the smallest position in `p`.
     - Inside the loop, it calculates the number of players to be kicked out in the current round by summing up `1` for each position `x` in `p` that is less than or equal to `n`.
     - It then subtracts this count from `n` to update the number of players remaining.
     - This process repeats until no more players can be kicked out (i.e., `n` is less than the smallest position in `p`).
     - Finally, it returns `n`, which represents the number of players remaining after the game ends.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - **Purpose**: To read the input, process each test case using `func_1`, and print the results.
   - **Logic**:
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads the values of `k` (length of the sequence `p`), `q` (number of initial player counts to process), the sequence `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
     - It then iterates over each initial player count `n` in `qs`, calls `func_1(n, p)` to determine the number of remaining players, and appends the result to the list `res`.
     - After processing all initial player counts for a test case, it prints the results in `res`.

### Analysis:

- The logic in `func_1` correctly simulates the game by iteratively removing players at the specified positions until no more players can be removed.
- The logic in `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases and processes each initial player count as required.
- The output is printed in the correct format, with each test case's results separated by spaces.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and produces the expected output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
