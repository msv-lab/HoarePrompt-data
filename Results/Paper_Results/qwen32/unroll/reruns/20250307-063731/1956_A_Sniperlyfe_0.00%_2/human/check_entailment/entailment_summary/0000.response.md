### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Breakdown:

1. **Game Rules**:
   - We have a sequence of integers `a` representing positions of players to be removed in each round.
   - Players are removed simultaneously from these positions if they exist.
   - The process continues until no players can be removed.
   - The remaining players are declared winners.

2. **Input**:
   - The number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - `k`: the length of the sequence `a`.
     - `q`: the number of queries.
     - `a`: a list of `k` integers representing the positions to remove players.
     - `n`: a list of `q` integers representing the initial number of players for each query.

3. **Output**:
   - For each query `n` in each test case, output the number of players remaining after the game ends.

#### Code Breakdown:

- **Function `func_1(n, p)`**:
  - This function takes `n` (initial number of players) and `p` (positions to remove players).
  - It repeatedly subtracts the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` from `n` until `n` is less than the smallest element in `p`.
  - This simulates the process of removing players at the specified positions in each round until no more players can be removed.

- **Function `func_2()`**:
  - This function reads the input for multiple test cases.
  - For each test case, it reads `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs`.
  - It processes each query `n` in `qs` using `func_1` to determine the number of remaining players and prints the results.

### Analysis:

- **Function `func_1(n, p)`**:
  - The logic correctly simulates the removal of players based on the positions specified in `p`.
  - It ensures that only players within the current count `n` are considered for removal.
  - The loop continues until `n` is less than the smallest position in `p`, which means no more players can be removed.

- **Function `func_2()`**:
  - It correctly handles multiple test cases and processes each query independently.
  - It reads the input values correctly and applies `func_1` to each query to determine the number of remaining players.
  - The results are printed in the required format.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem. It accurately simulates the game and determines the number of winners for each initial number of players in the queries.

**Correctness: True**
