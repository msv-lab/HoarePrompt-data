`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `n` and `p` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing the initial number of players in the game, and `p` is a list of `k` integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round, where 1 <= `k` <= 100 and 1 <= `p[i]` <= 100 for all `i` in the range of `k`; `t` is an input integer.**
