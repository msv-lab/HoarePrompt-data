The function determines the winner of a game played on a tree structure. It accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in the tree, a list of `n-1` edges represented by pairs of integers `(u, v)` indicating the connections between nodes, and a starting node `u_1`. The function simulates a traversal of the tree starting from `u_1` and determines whether the number of nodes processed is odd or even. It prints 'Hermione' if the number of nodes processed is odd, otherwise 'Ron'.
