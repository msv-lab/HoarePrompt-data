The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. This operation does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state (`n`, `t`, the edges of the tree, and `u_1`). The values of `x` and `y` are now determined by the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v such that 1 <= u, v <= n representing the edges of the tree, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains a single integer u_1 such that 1 <= u_1 <= n, representing the starting node of the game. `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input.**
