The code snippet initializes a defaultdict with lists as the default factory. This does not change the values of `n`, `t`, the edges of the tree, the starting node `u_1`, or the integers `x` and `y`. The only new variable introduced is `lst`, which is a defaultdict of lists.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v such that 1 <= u, v <= n representing the edges of the tree, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains a single integer u_1 such that 1 <= u_1 <= n, representing the starting node of the game. `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input. `lst` is a defaultdict with lists as the default factory.**
