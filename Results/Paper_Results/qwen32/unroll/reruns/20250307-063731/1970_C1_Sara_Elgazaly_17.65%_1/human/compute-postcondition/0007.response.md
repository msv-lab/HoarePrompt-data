Output State: **`lst[x]` is an empty list, and `s` is `False` if the number of nodes processed is even, or `True` if the number of nodes processed is odd.**

This means the boolean value of `s` has been flipped. If `s` was `True`, it is now `False`. If `s` was `False`, it is now `True`. The state of `lst[x]` remains unchanged as an empty list.
