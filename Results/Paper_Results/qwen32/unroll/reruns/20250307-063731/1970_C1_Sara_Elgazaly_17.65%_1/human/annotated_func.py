#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, t is an integer equal to 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v such that 1 <= u, v <= n representing the edges of the tree, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains a single integer u_1 such that 1 <= u_1 <= n, representing the starting node of the game.
def func():

#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines the winner of a game played on a tree structure. It accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in the tree, a list of `n-1` edges represented by pairs of integers `(u, v)` indicating the connections between nodes, and a starting node `u_1`. The function simulates a traversal of the tree starting from `u_1` and determines whether the number of nodes processed is odd or even. It prints 'Hermione' if the number of nodes processed is odd, otherwise 'Ron'.
