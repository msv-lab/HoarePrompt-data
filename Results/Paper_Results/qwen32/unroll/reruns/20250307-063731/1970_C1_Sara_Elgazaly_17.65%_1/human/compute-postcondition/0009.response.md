Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree, an integer `t` which is always 1, a list of `n-1` edges represented by pairs of integers `(u, v)` indicating the connections between nodes, and a starting node `u_1`. The function returns the distance from the starting node `u_1` to the farthest leaf node in the tree.**
