The code snippet assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `s`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`lst` is a defaultdict with lists as the default factory, containing the adjacency list for the first `x - 1` edges of the tree; `n`, `t`, `u_1`, `x`, `y` remain unchanged; `s` is `True`.**
