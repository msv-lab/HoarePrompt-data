Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. If the conditions or calculations based on `n`, `k`, and `a` meet a specific case, it returns a corresponding result for that case.**
