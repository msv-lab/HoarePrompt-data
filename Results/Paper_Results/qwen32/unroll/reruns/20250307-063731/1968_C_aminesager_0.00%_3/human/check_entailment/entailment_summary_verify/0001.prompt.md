You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input('')
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [1000]
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])
        a = a[::-1]
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n-1` integers. It then calculates and prints a list of `n` integers in reverse order, where each integer is determined based on the differences between consecutive elements in the input list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `x` of length `n-1`.
3. The program initializes the array `a` with a single element `1000`.
4. It then iterates from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive), appending to `a` the value `a[i-1] - T[i-1]` for each `i`.
5. After the loop, it reverses the array `a`.
6. Finally, it prints the elements of `a` as a space-separated string.

The key part of the problem is to construct an array `a` such that `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`. The program does not correctly implement this logic.

Here is a counterexample to show that the program is incorrect:
- Consider the input `n = 3` and `x = [1, 1]`.
- The program will construct `a` as `[1000, 999, 998]` and then reverse it to `[998, 999, 1000]`.
- However, `999 % 998 = 1` and `1000 % 999 = 1`, which satisfies the condition, but it is not the only solution and the program's logic is not guaranteed to work for all inputs.

However, let's consider another example:
- Consider the input `n = 3` and `x = [2, 1]`.
- The program will construct `a` as `[1000, 998, 997]` and then reverse it to `[997, 998, 1000]`.
- Here, `998 % 997 = 1` and `1000 % 998 = 2`, which does not satisfy the condition.

Thus, the program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not guarantee that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `2 <= i <= n`.
