The only variable in the loop head is `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Since `t` is within this range, it ensures that `t` is greater than 0, and thus the loop can execute.

No other states need to be adjusted because the loop condition only depends on `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, and `x` is a list of n-1 integers where each element x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
