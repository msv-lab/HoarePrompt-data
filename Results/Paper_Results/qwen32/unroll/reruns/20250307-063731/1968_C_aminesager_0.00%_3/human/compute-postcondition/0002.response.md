To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to analyze the provided loop and how it processes the input data.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, the value of `n` (the number of elements in the sequence) is read.
   - The next line is read as a string, split into integers, and stored in the list `T`.

2. **List `a` Construction:**
   - A list `a` is initialized with the value `[1000]`.
   - For each element from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive), the next element in `a` is calculated as the previous element minus the corresponding element in `T` (i.e., `a[i] = a[i-1] - T[i-1]`).
   - After the loop, the list `a` is reversed.

3. **Output:**
   - The reversed list `a` is converted to a space-separated string and printed.

### Output State:
For each test case, the list `a` is constructed based on the input list `T` and the initial value `1000`. The list `a` is then reversed and printed. The state of variables `t`, `n`, and `x` (which is not used in the loop) remains unchanged except that `t` is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the outer loop.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's consider an example to illustrate the process:
- Suppose `t = 2`, `n = 3`, and `T = [200, 300]` for the first test case.
  - Initialize `a` as `[1000]`.
  - For `i = 1`, `a[1] = a[0] - T[0] = 1000 - 200 = 800`.
  - For `i = 2`, `a[2] = a[1] - T[1] = 800 - 300 = 500`.
  - Reverse `a` to get `[500, 800, 1000]`.
  - Print `500 800 1000`.

- For the second test case, if `n = 4` and `T = [100, 150, 200]`:
  - Initialize `a` as `[1000]`.
  - For `i = 1`, `a[1] = a[0] - T[0] = 1000 - 100 = 900`.
  - For `i = 2`, `a[2] = a[1] - T[1] = 900 - 150 = 750`.
  - For `i = 3`, `a[3] = a[2] - T[2] = 750 - 200 = 550`.
  - Reverse `a` to get `[550, 750, 900, 1000]`.
  - Print `550 750 900 1000`.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations, the output state consists of the printed results for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, and `x` (if not modified within the loop) remain unchanged.

Output State: **The output state consists of the printed results for each test case, where each result is a space-separated string of integers representing the reversed list `a` for that test case.**
