t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 500, and a list x of n-1 integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
