Reasoning:
The given program is intended to solve the problem by constructing an array `a` such that each `a_i % a_(i-1) = x_i` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`. However, the logic used in the program does not correctly achieve this.

The program initializes the list `a` with a single element `1000` and then iteratively calculates the next elements of `a` by subtracting the corresponding `x_i` from the previous `a_(i-1)`. It then reverses the list `a` before printing it. This approach does not guarantee that the constructed array `a` will satisfy the required condition `a_i % a_(i-1) = x_i`.

For example, consider the first test case from the problem statement:
- `n = 4`
- `x = [2, 4, 1]`

The program will construct `a` as follows:
- Start with `a = [1000]`
- `a[1] = a[0] - x[0] = 1000 - 2 = 998`
- `a[2] = a[1] - x[1] = 998 - 4 = 994`
- `a[3] = a[2] - x[2] = 994 - 1 = 993`
- Reverse `a` to get `[993, 994, 998, 1000]`

However, this array does not satisfy the conditions:
- `994 % 993 != 2`
- `998 % 994 != 4`
- `1000 % 998 != 1`

A correct approach would be to choose `a_1` to be a sufficiently large number (e.g., `10^9 + 1`), and then set `a_i = a_(i-1) + x_i` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`. This ensures that `a_i % a_(i-1) = x_i` because `a_i = k * a_(i-1) + x_i` for some integer `k`, and thus `a_i % a_(i-1) = x_i`.

Given that the program does not follow this correct logic, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
