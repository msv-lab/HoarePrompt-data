`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables (`n`, `x`) remain unchanged since they are not affected by this line of code. The precondition for `t` is that it is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and this precondition still holds after the code execution.
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, and `x` is a list of n-1 integers where each element x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
