The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are three lines: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16) representing the number of rounds, a single character representing the trump suit (one of "CDHS"), and a space-separated list of 2n cards. Each card is represented by a two-character string, where the first character is the rank of the card (one of "23456789") and the second character is the suit of the card (one of "CDHS"). All cards in the list are distinct.
