Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes a set of card pairs for a given number of test cases, taking into account a specified trump suit. It outputs pairs of cards, ensuring that each non-trump suit has its highest-ranked pair matched, and any remaining unpaired cards are matched with the highest-ranked trump cards. If there are not enough trump cards to match all unpaired cards, it outputs "IMPOSSIBLE". The function does not return a value but prints the results directly.**
