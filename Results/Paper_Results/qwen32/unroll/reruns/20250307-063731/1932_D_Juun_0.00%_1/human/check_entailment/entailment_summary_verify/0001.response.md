### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the `func_1` function based on the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary.

#### Key Steps in `func_1`:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function skips the number of rounds (since it's not needed for processing the cards).
   - It reads the trump suit.
   - It initializes an empty list `trumps` for storing ranks of trump cards and a dictionary `suits` to store the highest rank of non-trump cards for each suit.

2. **Processing Cards:**
   - The function iterates through each card in the discard pile.
   - If the card is a trump card, its rank is added to the `trumps` list.
   - If the card is a non-trump card:
     - If a card of the same suit is already in `suits`, it forms a pair with the existing card and adds the sorted pair to `answers`. It then resets the entry in `suits` for that suit.
     - If no card of the same suit is in `suits`, it stores the rank of the card in `suits`.

3. **Handling Remaining Cards:**
   - After processing all cards, for each suit in `suits` that still has a card:
     - If there are trump cards available, it pairs the non-trump card with the lowest-ranked trump card and removes that trump card from `trumps`.
     - If no trump cards are available, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE" and returns, as it's not possible to pair the remaining non-trump cards.

4. **Printing Remaining Trump Cards:**
   - The function sorts the remaining trump cards and pairs them with each other in ascending order of rank.

5. **Printing Answers:**
   - Finally, it prints all the pairs stored in `answers`.

#### Analysis of Correctness:
- **Trump Cards Handling:**
  - The function correctly pairs trump cards with each other in ascending order.
  - Non-trump cards are correctly paired with trump cards if available.

- **Non-Trump Cards Handling:**
  - The function correctly pairs non-trump cards of the same suit if they appear consecutively.
  - If a non-trump card is left without a pair and there are no trump cards, the function correctly outputs "IMPOSSIBLE".

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles cases where there are no trump cards and all non-trump cards are of different suits.
  - The function handles cases where there are not enough trump cards to pair with remaining non-trump cards.

#### Potential Issues:
- **Order of Pairs:**
  - The function does not guarantee a specific order of pairs for non-trump cards, which is acceptable as per the problem statement (any valid sequence is acceptable).
- **Sorting Trump Cards:**
  - The function sorts the trump cards before pairing them, which is correct as per the rules.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to reconstruct the rounds played in the game based on the given rules and constraints. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`.

Final: **True**
