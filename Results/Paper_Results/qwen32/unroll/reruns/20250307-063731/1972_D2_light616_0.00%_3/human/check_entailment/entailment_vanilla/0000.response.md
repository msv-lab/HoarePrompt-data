To determine if the given program is correct based on the provided problem description, let's analyze the logic and implementation step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

### Given Program Analysis
Let's break down the provided code.

#### Function `func_1`
- This function is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a single test case.
- It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
- It reads the values of `n` and `m` from the input.
- It uses a nested loop where `y` starts from 1 and checks conditions involving `x` and `y`.
- The condition `(x + y) * x <= n` ensures that `a = x` and `a + b = (x + y)` does not exceed `n`.
- The condition `(x + y) * y <= m` ensures that `b = y` and `a + b = (x + y)` does not exceed `m`.
- If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) (i.e., `x` and `y` are coprime), it attempts to count the number of valid pairs using `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.
- Finally, it prints the count of valid pairs.

#### Function `func_2`
- This function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
- It calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**:
   - The logic used in `func_1` to count valid pairs is flawed. The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and the subsequent calculation of `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` do not correctly determine the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the problem's conditions.
   - The program does not properly iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Incorrect Loop Conditions**:
   - The loop conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are not sufficient to ensure that all valid pairs are considered.
   - The loop only considers pairs where `x` and `y` are coprime and does not account for other possible values of `a` and `b`.

### Correct Implementation Approach
A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\) holds. This can be done using nested loops for `a` and `b` and using the `math.gcd` function to compute the greatest common divisor.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified in the provided program, it is clear that the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
