Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is `input_n`
- `m` is `input_m`
- `x` is the smallest integer such that `x * x > n`
- `cnt` is the total count accumulated based on the conditions specified in the loop.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(cnt)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `n` and `m`**:
   - `n` and `m` are assigned the values of `input_n` and `input_m` respectively. However, their exact values are not provided, so we can't determine specific values for them.

2. **Variable `x`**:
   - `x` is the smallest integer such that `x * x > n`. This means if `n` is a given number, `x` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`.
   - For example, if `n` is 10, `x` would be 4, because \(4^2 = 16\) which is the smallest perfect square greater than 10.

3. **Variable `cnt`**:
   - `cnt` is the total count accumulated based on some conditions specified in a loop. Since the loop is not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `cnt`. However, we know that `cnt` is some integer value that results from the loop's logic.

### Conclusion:
- The `print(cnt)` statement will print the value of `cnt`, which is an integer accumulated based on the conditions in the loop.
- Since the specific loop logic is not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `cnt`. However, we know it is an integer.

### Final Output:
Output: **cnt (where cnt is the total count accumulated based on the conditions specified in the loop)**
