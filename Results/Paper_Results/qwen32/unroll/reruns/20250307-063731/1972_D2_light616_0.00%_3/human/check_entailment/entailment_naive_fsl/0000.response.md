Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the problem as described. Let's analyze why:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to handle a single test case by iterating over possible pairs `(x, y)` and checking if `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`.
   - The condition `(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m` is not correctly checking all possible pairs `(a, b)`.
   - The code only checks pairs where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and counts pairs based on a formula that does not correctly represent the problem's requirements.

2. **Loop Conditions**:
   - The loop `while x * x <= n:` and `while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:` are not exhaustive for all pairs `(a, b)`.
   - The condition `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is not correctly calculating the number of valid pairs.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - However, since `func_1` is incorrect, the overall solution is incorrect.

4. **Example Case**:
   - Let's take the example `n = 2, m = 3`. The correct output should be `1` because the only valid pair is `(2, 3)`.
   - The provided code does not correctly identify this pair because the loop conditions and the logic for counting pairs are incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, and hence it is incorrect.
