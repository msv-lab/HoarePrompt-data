Reasoning: 

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b for multiple test cases.

Let's analyze the provided functions:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to zero.
   - It iterates over possible values of `x` starting from 1 up to the square root of `n`.
   - For each `x`, it iterates over possible values of `y` starting from 1.
   - The condition `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` ensures that `a` and `b` are within the bounds of `n` and `m` respectively.
   - If `gcd(x, y) == 1`, it increments the count by `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.
   - The function prints the count `cnt`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` exactly `t` times, which means it processes each test case independently.

The logic in `func_1` is intended to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for a single test case. However, there are several issues with the logic:

- The iteration over `x` and `y` does not cover all possible pairs `(a, b)`. It only checks pairs where `gcd(x, y) == 1`, which is not sufficient to cover all valid pairs.
- The condition `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` seems incorrect for counting valid pairs. It does not correctly compute the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`.
- The logic does not correctly implement the condition that `b * gcd(a, b)` should be a multiple of `a + b`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
