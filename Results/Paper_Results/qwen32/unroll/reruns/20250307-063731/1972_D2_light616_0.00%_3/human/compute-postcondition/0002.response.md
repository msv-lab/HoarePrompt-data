To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to consider the given loop and the function `func_1()`.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()
```

The loop iterates `t` times, and in each iteration, the function `func_1()` is called. However, the function `func_1()` is not defined in the provided code snippet, so we cannot determine the exact changes it makes to the variables `n` and `m` or any other variables. Since the problem states that the state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged, and no changes to `n` and `m` are specified, we can infer that `n` and `m` remain unchanged unless `func_1()` modifies them.

Given that we have no information about the implementation of `func_1()`, we assume that `func_1()` does not modify `n` and `m`. Therefore, after the loop executes, the values of `n` and `m` will remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `t` is an input integer.**
