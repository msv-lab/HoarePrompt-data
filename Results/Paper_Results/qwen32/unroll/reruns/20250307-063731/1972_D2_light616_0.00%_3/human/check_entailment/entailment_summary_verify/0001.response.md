### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the provided program and the function summaries to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - Reads `n` and `m` from input.
  - Uses nested loops to iterate over possible values of `x` and `y`.
  - Checks conditions involving `x` and `y` to count valid pairs.
  - Uses `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and a calculation involving `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` to count pairs.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - Calls `func_1` for each test case.

#### Function Summary Recap:
The function summary for `func_2` is accurate. It correctly states that `func_2` reads `t` and calls `func_1` `t` times.

#### Issues in `func_1`:
1. **Incorrect Calculation Logic**:
   - The current logic in `func_1` is flawed. It checks if `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and then uses a calculation involving `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` to count valid pairs. This approach does not correctly determine the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the problem's conditions.
   - The program does not properly iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Incorrect Loop Conditions**:
   - The loop conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are not sufficient to ensure that all valid pairs are considered.
   - The loop only considers pairs where `x` and `y` are coprime and does not account for other possible values of `a` and `b`.

#### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\) holds. This can be done using nested loops for `a` and `b` and using the `math.gcd` function to compute the greatest common divisor.

#### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the provided program, it is clear that the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic used in `func_1` is flawed, and the loop conditions do not ensure that all valid pairs are considered.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
