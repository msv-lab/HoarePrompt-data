### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

**Problem Recap:**
- We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
  - \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
  - \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
  - \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

**Program Analysis:**

The program consists of two functions: `func_1()` and `func_2()`. Here's how they work:

1. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - It reads two integers `n` and `m`.
   - It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
   - It iterates over possible values of `x` from 1 up to \(\sqrt{n}\) (inclusive).
   - For each `x`, it iterates over possible values of `y` from 1 up to the point where \((x + y) * x \leq n\) and \((x + y) * y \leq m\).
   - If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) * x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) * y} \right\rfloor\).
   - Finally, it prints the accumulated count `cnt`.

**Critical Points to Consider:**

- The loop over `x` only goes up to \(\sqrt{n}\). This is not sufficient to cover all possible values of `a` and `b` in the range \([1, n]\) and \([1, m]\) respectively.
- The condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) is used, but it does not directly address the condition that \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) must be a multiple of \(a + b\).
- The calculation of `cnt` uses a formula that does not accurately reflect the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

**Correctness:**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem because:
- It does not properly iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\).
- The logic for counting valid pairs is flawed.

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect. Therefore, the answer is:

**Correctness: **False****
