Let's analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary to evaluate the correctness of the program.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

### Program Code Analysis:

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: To handle a single test case by counting valid pairs \((x, y)\).
- **Logic**:
  - The loop `while x * x <= n:` iterates over possible values of \(x\) such that \(x^2 \le n\).
  - The nested loop `while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:` iterates over possible values of \(y\) such that \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
  - Inside the nested loop, it checks if \(\gcd(x, y) == 1\) and then counts pairs based on the formula `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: To handle multiple test cases.
- **Logic**: Reads the number of test cases \(t\) and calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Function Summary Recap:
- `func_2` reads an integer \(t\) from the input and calls `func_1` exactly \(t\) times.
- `func_1` does not accept parameters `n` and `m` directly, nor does it return the GCD of `n` and `m`. The final state of the program is that `func_1` has been executed \(t\) times.

### Original Assessment Recap:
- The original assessment states that the program is incorrect due to the logic in `func_1` not correctly checking all pairs \((a, b)\) and using an incorrect formula to count pairs.

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Loop Conditions**:
   - The outer loop `while x * x <= n:` ensures that \(x\) is within a reasonable range, but it does not guarantee that all pairs \((a, b)\) are checked.
   - The inner loop `while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:` further restricts the range of \(y\), which might miss valid pairs.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:` restricts the pairs to those with \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). This is not aligned with the problem requirement, which does not impose such a restriction.

3. **Counting Pairs**:
   - The formula `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is used to count pairs, which does not accurately represent the problem's requirement to check if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

4. **Example Case**:
   - For the example `n = 2, m = 3`, the correct output should be `1` because the only valid pair is `(2, 3)`. However, the provided code does not correctly identify this pair due to the aforementioned issues.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem as described. The logic in `func_1` is flawed, and the formula used to count pairs is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
