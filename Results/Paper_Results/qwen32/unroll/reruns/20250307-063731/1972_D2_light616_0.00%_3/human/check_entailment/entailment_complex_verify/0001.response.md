### Reasoning

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to carefully analyze whether the logic and implementation align with the problem requirements. Let's break down the problem and the provided code step by step.

#### Problem Requirements
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Provided Program Analysis

**Function `func_1`**:
- The function reads `n` and `m` from the input.
- It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
- It uses a nested loop where `y` starts from 1.
- The outer loop runs while `x * x <= n`.
- The inner loop runs while `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
- If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it calculates `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` and adds it to `cnt`.
- Finally, it prints `cnt`.

**Function `func_2`**:
- This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
- It calls `func_1` for each test case.

#### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Pair Iteration**:
   - The program only considers pairs where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). This means it only checks pairs where `x` and `y` are coprime.
   - The problem requires checking all pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\), not just those where `a` and `b` are coprime.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The logic `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is incorrect for counting valid pairs. This calculation does not properly determine if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
   - The program does not iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b` and check the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\).

3. **Loop Conditions**:
   - The loop conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are too restrictive. They do not ensure that all valid pairs are considered.
   - The program should iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b` within their respective ranges and check the condition for each pair.

#### Correct Implementation Approach
A correct approach would involve:
- Iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
- For each pair, checking if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\).
- Counting the number of pairs that satisfy the condition.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified in the provided program, it is clear that the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic and implementation are flawed, and the program does not properly iterate over all possible pairs and check the required condition.

**Final: False**
