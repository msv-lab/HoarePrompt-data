You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, then calls `func_1` exactly `t` times. The function does not accept parameters `n` and `m` directly, nor does it return the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and `m`. The final state of the program after it concludes is that `func_1` has been executed `t` times.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program is correct based on the provided problem description, let's analyze the logic and implementation step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

### Given Program Analysis
Let's break down the provided code.

#### Function `func_1`
- This function is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a single test case.
- It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
- It reads the values of `n` and `m` from the input.
- It uses a nested loop where `y` starts from 1 and checks conditions involving `x` and `y`.
- The condition `(x + y) * x <= n` ensures that `a = x` and `a + b = (x + y)` does not exceed `n`.
- The condition `(x + y) * y <= m` ensures that `b = y` and `a + b = (x + y)` does not exceed `m`.
- If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) (i.e., `x` and `y` are coprime), it attempts to count the number of valid pairs using `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.
- Finally, it prints the count of valid pairs.

#### Function `func_2`
- This function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
- It calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**:
   - The logic used in `func_1` to count valid pairs is flawed. The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and the subsequent calculation of `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` do not correctly determine the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the problem's conditions.
   - The program does not properly iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Incorrect Loop Conditions**:
   - The loop conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are not sufficient to ensure that all valid pairs are considered.
   - The loop only considers pairs where `x` and `y` are coprime and does not account for other possible values of `a` and `b`.

### Correct Implementation Approach
A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\) holds. This can be done using nested loops for `a` and `b` and using the `math.gcd` function to compute the greatest common divisor.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified in the provided program, it is clear that the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
