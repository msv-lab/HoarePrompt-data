### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

The problem requires us to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

The code consists of two functions:
- `func_1()`: This function reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) and calculates the number of valid pairs based on the given conditions.
- `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases \(t\) and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

#### Analysis of `func_1()`:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `x` is initialized to 1.
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0.

2. **Outer Loop**:
   - The outer loop runs while \(x \cdot x \leq n\). This loop iterates over possible values of \(x\) starting from 1.

3. **Inner Loop**:
   - The inner loop runs while \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\). This loop iterates over possible values of \(y\) starting from 1.
   - Inside the inner loop, the code checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If true, it increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

4. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \equiv 0 \pmod{a + b}\) is not directly checked. Instead, the code uses the property that if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), then \(b \cdot \gcd(x, b) = b\) must be a multiple of \(a + b\). This is a valid simplification under the condition that \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).

5. **Output**:
   - After the loops complete, the function prints the value of `cnt`.

#### Analysis of `func_2()`:

- `func_2()` reads the number of test cases \(t\) and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The code correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) for each test case based on the given conditions. The use of \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) simplifies the problem, and the loops ensure that all possible pairs are considered.

Thus, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
