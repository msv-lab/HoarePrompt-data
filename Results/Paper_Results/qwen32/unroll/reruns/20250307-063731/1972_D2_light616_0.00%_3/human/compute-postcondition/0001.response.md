The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which determines how many times the loop will execute. The variables `n` and `m` are mentioned in the state before the loop starts, but they are not directly part of the loop head, so we cannot adjust them to ensure the loop executes.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The loop will execute `t` times, so `t` should be a positive integer.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `t` must be greater than 0**
