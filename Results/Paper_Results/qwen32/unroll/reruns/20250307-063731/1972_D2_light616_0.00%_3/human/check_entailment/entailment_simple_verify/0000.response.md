### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code, using the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\),
2. \(1 \le b \le m\),
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code consists of two functions:
- `func_1()`: Handles a single test case by iterating over possible pairs \((x, y)\) and checking if the conditions are met.
- `func_2()`: Handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case.

#### Annotations:
Annotations provide insight into the state of the program at key points:
- The outer loop `while x * x <= n:` and the inner loop `while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:` are intended to iterate over possible pairs \((x, y)\).
- The condition `if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:` checks if \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime.
- The line `cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` attempts to count valid pairs based on the formula.

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Loop Conditions**:
   - The loop conditions `while x * x <= n:` and `while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:` are not exhaustive for all pairs \((a, b)\). They restrict the search space too narrowly.
   
2. **Counting Valid Pairs**:
   - The formula `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is not correctly implementing the logic to count valid pairs. It seems to be attempting to count pairs based on a specific condition, but it does not correctly reflect the problem's requirements.

3. **Handling Coprime Pairs**:
   - The condition `if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:` only considers coprime pairs, which is not sufficient to solve the problem as stated. The problem does not restrict pairs to coprime values.

#### Example Case Analysis:
Let's consider the example `n = 2, m = 3`:
- The correct output is `1` because the only valid pair is \((2, 3)\).
- The provided code does not correctly identify this pair due to the restrictive loop conditions and the incorrect counting logic.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the problem as described. The loop conditions and the logic for counting pairs are incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
