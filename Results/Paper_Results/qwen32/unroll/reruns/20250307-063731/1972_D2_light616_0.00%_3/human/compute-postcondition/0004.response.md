Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, then calls `func_1` exactly `t` times. The function does not accept parameters `n` and `m` directly, nor does it return the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and `m`. The final state of the program after it concludes is that `func_1` has been executed `t` times.**
