Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of elements in a list, and a list `a` of `n` integers. Each integer in the list `a` is within the range 1 to 10^9. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one.**
