### Reasoning:

The provided program is indeed incorrect based on the problem description and the function summary. Let's break down the issues systematically:

1. **Median Calculation**:
   - The program correctly identifies the median index using `mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
   - However, it does not correctly determine the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median.

2. **Increasing the Median**:
   - The program incorrectly counts the number of elements equal to the median (`a[mdx]`). This count does not directly translate to the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.
   - To increase the median, we need to ensure that the middle element(s) in the sorted list become larger than their current value. This involves incrementing the smallest elements that are less than or equal to the current median.

3. **Logic Flaw**:
   - The logic `res += 1` for each element equal to `a[mdx]` is incorrect. Instead, we need to determine the smallest number of operations required to make the median larger than its current value.
   - For example, if the median is `m`, we need to increment elements until the new median is greater than `m`. This involves incrementing the smallest elements that are less than or equal to `m`.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - **Input**: `1 3 1 1 2`
   - **Expected Output**: `1`
   - **Explanation**: The median of `[1, 1, 2]` is `1`. To increase the median, we need to make it at least `2`. We can do this by incrementing one of the `1`s to `2`. The program, however, will output `2` because it counts the number of `1`s equal to the median, which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
- Sort the array.
- Identify the median.
- Calculate the number of operations needed to make the median larger than its current value by incrementing elements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
