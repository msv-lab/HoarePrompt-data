### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem requirements in detail.

The problem requires finding the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median of the array. An operation is defined as increasing any element of the array by 1.

The provided program sorts the array and then calculates the number of elements from the median position to the end of the array that are equal to the median. This count is then printed as the result.

However, this approach is incorrect for the following reasons:

1. **Median Calculation**: The median is the middle element in a sorted array. For an odd-length array, it is the middle element. For an even-length array, it is the lower middle element (since the problem specifies \(\lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil\), which rounds up to the nearest integer).

2. **Increasing the Median**: The goal is to increase the median by the minimum number of operations. The provided program does not actually perform any operations to increase the median; it only counts how many elements are equal to the current median.

3. **Minimum Operations**: To increase the median, we need to focus on the median element(s) and determine the minimum number of increments required to make the median larger than its current value. This involves finding the smallest number of increments needed to make the median larger than the current median value, which may involve incrementing one or more elements.

### Correctness:

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to increase the median. Instead, it counts the number of elements equal to the current median, which is not the correct approach.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
