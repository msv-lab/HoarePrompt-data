Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The logic in the program is flawed as it does not consider the correct approach to increasing the median.

Here's a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Median Calculation**: The median is the middle element in a sorted list. For an odd-length list, it's the middle element. For an even-length list, it's the higher of the two middle elements.

2. **Increasing the Median**: To increase the median, we need to ensure that the middle element(s) in the sorted list increase. The program incorrectly counts how many elements are equal to the median, which does not directly translate to the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

3. **Logic Flaw**: The logic `res += 1` for each element equal to `a[mdx]` is incorrect. Instead, we need to determine the smallest number of operations required to make the median larger than its current value.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness:

**Counterexample:**

Input:
```
1
3
1 1 2
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Explanation:
- The median of the array `[1, 1, 2]` is `1`.
- To increase the median, we need to make it at least `2`.
- We can do this by increasing one of the `1`s to `2`.
- The program, however, will output `2` because it counts the number of `1`s equal to the median, which is incorrect.

The correct approach to solve this problem involves:
- Sorting the array.
- Identifying the median.
- Calculating the number of operations needed to make the median larger than its current value by incrementing elements.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
