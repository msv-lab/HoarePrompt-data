In the given task, the `while` loop condition is `t > 0`. This means that for the loop to execute at least once, the variable `t` must be greater than 0. The variables `n` and `a` are not part of the loop condition and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given:
- `t` is an input integer.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.

Since only `t` is relevant to the loop condition, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9**
