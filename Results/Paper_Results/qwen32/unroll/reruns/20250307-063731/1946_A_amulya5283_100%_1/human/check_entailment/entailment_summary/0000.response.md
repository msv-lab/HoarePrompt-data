### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. However, the logic implemented in the program does not correctly achieve this goal.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Single Element Case:**
   - The program correctly handles the case when the array has only one element by printing `1`. This is because, in this scenario, increasing the single element will always increase the median (since the median is the element itself).

2. **General Case:**
   - The program sorts the array and identifies the median index (`mdx`).
   - It then counts the number of elements from the median index to the end of the array that are equal to the median value.
   - However, this count does not necessarily represent the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

3. **Median Calculation and Increment:**
   - The median is the middle element in the sorted array. For an odd-length array, it is the middle element. For an even-length array, it is the lower of the two middle elements.
   - To increase the median, we need to ensure that the median value in the sorted array is increased. This can be done by incrementing elements that are less than or equal to the current median until the median itself increases.
   - The program's current logic does not perform this increment operation; instead, it merely counts the occurrences of the median value.

### Example Analysis:

Let's consider the first test case from the example:

- Input: `3, [2, 2, 8]`
- Sorted Array: `[2, 2, 8]`
- Median Index (`mdx`): `1` (for 0-based indexing)
- Median Value: `2`
- Number of elements equal to the median from `mdx` to the end: `2`

The program outputs `2`, but the correct output should be `1` because we can increase the median by incrementing just one of the `2`s to make the array `[3, 2, 8]`, which has a median of `3`.

### Conclusion:

The program's logic does not correctly determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
