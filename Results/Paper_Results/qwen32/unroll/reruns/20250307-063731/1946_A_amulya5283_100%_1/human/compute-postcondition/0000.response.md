The variable `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `t` will hold the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables `n` and `a` are not affected by this input statement. Thus, `n` is still an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and `a` is still a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.**
