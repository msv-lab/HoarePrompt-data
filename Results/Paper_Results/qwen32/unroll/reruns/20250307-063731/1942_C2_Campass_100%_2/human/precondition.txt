t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. test_cases is a list of t test cases, where each test case is a tuple consisting of (n, x, y, vertices). n is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is an integer such that 0 <= y <= n - x, and vertices is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
