The provided code snippet only defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line of input, splits it into strings, and maps each string to an integer. This function is not executed in the snippet, so no variables are assigned values or modified by this code. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of the `R` function.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), and y is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. The second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `R` is a lambda function that maps input strings to integers.**
