Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the total number of vertices, an integer `x` representing the number of chosen vertices, and an integer `y` representing a specific value related to the vertices. It also accepts a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given inputs.**
