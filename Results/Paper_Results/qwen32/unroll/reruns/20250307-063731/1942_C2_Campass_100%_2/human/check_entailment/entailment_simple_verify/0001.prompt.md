You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `t` will be `0`, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `l`, `sx`, `val`, and `cons` will hold the values from the last test case processed. However, since the problem asks for the output state after all executions of the loop, we focus on the printed results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake by selecting vertices to form diagonals. We are given a regular polygon with `n` sides, `x` vertices already chosen by Bessie, and we can choose up to `y` additional vertices. The goal is to maximize the number of triangles formed by these vertices.

### Approach:
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `n`, `x`, and `y`, and then read the `x` vertices chosen by Bessie.

2. **Sorting and Gap Calculation:**
   - Sort the vertices chosen by Bessie.
   - Calculate the gaps between consecutive vertices, wrapping around to the start of the polygon.

3. **Sorting Gaps:**
   - Sort the gaps in a way that prioritizes gaps that can form more triangles. The sorting key `(1 - x & 1, x)` suggests a preference for odd gaps over even gaps, which seems to be a heuristic to maximize the number of triangles.

4. **Maximizing Triangles:**
   - Iterate over the sorted gaps and try to use as many vertices as possible to form triangles.
   - For each gap `i`, calculate the number of triangles that can be formed (`i // 2`).
   - If the remaining vertices `y` are sufficient to form all these triangles, subtract the used vertices from `y` and add the triangles to the count.
   - If not, use all remaining vertices to form as many triangles as possible and break the loop.

5. **Output:**
   - Calculate the total number of triangles formed and print it.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Sorting Heuristic:**
   - The sorting heuristic `(1 - x & 1, x)` is not clearly explained. It seems to prioritize odd gaps, which might not always yield the optimal solution. This heuristic could be incorrect in some cases.

2. **Triangle Calculation:**
   - The calculation `i // 2` for the number of triangles in a gap of size `i` is correct, but the logic for using the remaining vertices `y` is flawed. The program does not correctly account for the number of triangles that can be formed with the remaining vertices.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where `y` is zero or where the gaps are very small. It might not correctly account for these scenarios.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem due to the heuristic used for sorting gaps and the incorrect logic for using the remaining vertices `y`. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
