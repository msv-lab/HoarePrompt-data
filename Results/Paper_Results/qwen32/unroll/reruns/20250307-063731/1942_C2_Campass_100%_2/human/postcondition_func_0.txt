The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing chosen vertices. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `cons` based on the given inputs, which represents the number of connections or modifications required among the chosen vertices.
