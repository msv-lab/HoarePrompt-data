The code snippet provided reads a single integer from the input using the lambda function `R` and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. The second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `R` is a lambda function that maps input strings to integers. `t` has been assigned the value from the input.**
