To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to understand the context and the logic behind the calculation of `ans`.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3 (though `t` is not used in the given code snippet).
- `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= x <= 10^8 and 1 <= n <= x.
- `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or its corresponding pair divisor `x // i` that is also less than or equal to `n`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
To find `ans`, we need to identify the divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `n` and select the largest one. If a divisor `i` of `x` (i.e., `x % i == 0`) is less than or equal to `n`, then `x // i` is also a divisor of `x`. We need to check both `i` and `x // i` to see which one is the largest and less than or equal to `n`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `x = 24` and `n = 10`:
- Divisors of 24 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.
- Divisors of 24 that are less than or equal to 10 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8.
- The largest divisor of 24 that is less than or equal to 10 is 8.
- For each divisor `i` less than or equal to 10, we also check `x // i`:
  - For `i = 1`, `x // 1 = 24` (not <= 10).
  - For `i = 2`, `x // 2 = 12` (not <= 10).
  - For `i = 3`, `x // 3 = 8` (<= 10).
  - For `i = 4`, `x // 4 = 6` (<= 10).
  - For `i = 6`, `x // 6 = 4` (<= 10).
  - For `i = 8`, `x // 8 = 3` (<= 10).
- The largest value among these is 8.

### General Case:
For any `x` and `n`, `ans` will be the largest value that is a divisor of `x` and less than or equal to `n`, or the corresponding pair divisor `x // i` that is also less than or equal to `n`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or its corresponding pair divisor `x // i` that is also less than or equal to `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to n or its corresponding pair divisor x // i that is also less than or equal to n)**
