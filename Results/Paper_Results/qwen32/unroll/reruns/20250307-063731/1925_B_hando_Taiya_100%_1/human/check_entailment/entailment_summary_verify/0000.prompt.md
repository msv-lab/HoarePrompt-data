You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads two integers `x` and `n` for each of `t` test cases, where `1 <= n <= x`. It calculates and prints the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or its corresponding pair divisor `x // i` that is also less than or equal to `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance (GCD) of the problemset by breaking up the problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems. 

Here's the breakdown of the logic:

1. **Iterate through potential divisors**: The program iterates through all possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the integer square root of `x`. This is a standard approach for finding divisors efficiently.
   
2. **Check conditions for valid sub-problems**:
   - If `i` is a divisor of `x` (`x % i == 0`), the program checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`. If true, `i` can be a possible balance.
   - Similarly, it checks if `n` is less than or equal to `i`. If true, `x // i` can be a possible balance.

3. **Update the maximum balance**: The program keeps track of the maximum balance found during the iteration.

4. **Output the result**: For each test case, the program prints the maximum balance.

The program handles all edge cases, such as:
- When `n == x`, the only possible balance is 1 (since each sub-problem must have a difficulty of 1).
- When `x` is a prime number, the maximum balance is 1 unless `n == 1`.
- When `x` is a composite number, the program correctly identifies the largest possible GCD.

The provided examples in the problem description are correctly handled by the program, and no potential cases where the program might fail have been identified. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases as per the problem description.
