You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers x and n such that 1 <= x <= 10^8 and 1 <= n <= x.
def func_1():
    x, n = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= x <= 10^8 and 1 <= n <= x; `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or its corresponding pair divisor `x // i` that is also less than or equal to `n`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to n or its corresponding pair divisor x // i that is also less than or equal to n)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two integers `x` and `n` for each of `t` test cases, where `1 <= n <= x`. It calculates and prints the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or its corresponding pair divisor `x // i` that is also less than or equal to `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the problem and the solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to break a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals `x`. The balance of the problemset is defined as the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difficulties of all sub-problems. The objective is to maximize this balance.

### Solution Analysis:
The program iterates over all possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`. For each divisor `i`:
- If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, then `i` can be a possible balance.
- If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, then `x // i` can be a possible balance.
- The program keeps track of the maximum balance found.

### Correctness Analysis:
The core idea is to find the largest divisor of `x` such that it can be used as the balance for the sub-problems. The divisor `i` or `x // i` can be a candidate for the balance if it's possible to split the problem into `n` sub-problems with that balance. 

1. **Divisor Check:** The program correctly checks all divisors up to the square root of `x`. This is efficient because if `i` is a divisor, then `x // i` is also a divisor.
2. **Balance Condition:** The program checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` or `i`, which ensures that the sub-problems can be formed with the given balance.
3. **Max Balance Update:** The program updates the maximum balance found during the iteration.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the solution with the given examples:

1. **First Test Case:** `x = 10`, `n = 3`
   - Divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10.
   - Possible balances: 1 (10//1 = 10, n <= 10), 2 (10//2 = 5, n <= 5), 5 (n > 5), 10 (n > 10).
   - Maximum balance: 2.

2. **Second Test Case:** `x = 5`, `n = 5`
   - Divisors of 5 are 1, 5.
   - Possible balances: 1 (5//1 = 5, n <= 5), 5 (n <= 5).
   - Maximum balance: 1 (since 5 sub-problems of difficulty 1 is the only way).

3. **Third Test Case:** `x = 420`, `n = 69`
   - Divisors of 420 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420.
   - Possible balances: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420.
   - Maximum balance: 6 (since 69 <= 420//6 = 70).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance by checking all possible divisors and ensuring that the sub-problems can be formed with the given balance.

Correctness: **True**
