The code snippet reads two integers from the input, `x` and `n`, and assigns them to the respective variables. The initial state provides that `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `x` and `n` are integers with specific constraints.

After executing the code snippet, the values of `x` and `n` will be updated to the integers read from the input. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= x <= 10^8 and 1 <= n <= x.**
