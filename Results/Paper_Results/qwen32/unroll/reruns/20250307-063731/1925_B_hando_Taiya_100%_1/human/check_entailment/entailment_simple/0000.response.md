### Reasoning:
The program's objective is to determine the maximum balance of a problemset, which is defined as the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difficulties of all sub-problems, given that the sum of the difficulties equals \( x \) and there are \( n \) sub-problems.

The approach taken in the program is to find the largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than or equal to \( n \) or its corresponding pair divisor \( x // i \) that is also less than or equal to \( n \). The largest such divisor will be the maximum balance since it can be used to evenly distribute the problem difficulty among the sub-problems.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases \( t \). For each test case, it reads two integers \( x \) and \( n \).
2. **Finding Divisors**: The program iterates over all possible divisors \( i \) of \( x \) from 1 to \( \sqrt{x} \). If \( i \) is a divisor of \( x \) (i.e., \( x \% i == 0 \)), it checks if \( i \) or \( x // i \) can be used as the difficulty of the sub-problems by ensuring they are less than or equal to \( n \).
3. **Updating Maximum Balance**: The program keeps track of the maximum divisor found that satisfies the condition \( i \leq n \) or \( x // i \leq n \).
4. **Output**: The program prints the maximum balance for each test case.

The algorithm is correct because:
- It considers all possible divisors of \( x \).
- It ensures that the divisor (or its pair) can be the difficulty of the sub-problems without exceeding the number of sub-problems \( n \).
- The maximum divisor found in this manner is indeed the maximum possible balance.
