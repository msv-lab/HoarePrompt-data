### Reasoning:
The problem requires us to find the maximum balance (GCD) of a set of `n` sub-problems such that their sum equals `x`. The balance is essentially the GCD of the difficulties of these sub-problems.

The provided solution iterates through all possible divisors of `x` up to its square root. For each divisor `i`:
- If `i` is a divisor of `x` (i.e., `x % i == 0`), it checks if `i` or `x // i` can be a valid number of sub-problems (i.e., less than or equal to `n`). If so, it updates the maximum balance (`ans`) accordingly.

The key insight here is that if `i` is a divisor of `x`, then `x / i` is also a divisor. The solution considers both `i` and `x / i` to find the maximum possible divisor that could serve as the balance, given the constraint on the number of sub-problems `n`.

Let's break down the example cases:
1. For `x = 10` and `n = 3`, the divisors of `10` are `1`, `2`, `5`, and `10`. The valid divisors that are less than or equal to `3` are `1` and `2`. The pair divisors are `10` and `5`, but only `5` is less than or equal to `3`. Therefore, the maximum balance is `2`.
2. For `x = 5` and `n = 5`, the divisors of `5` are `1` and `5`. The valid divisors that are less than or equal to `5` are `1` and `5`. The pair divisors are `5` and `1`, both of which are less than or equal to `5`. Therefore, the maximum balance is `1`.
3. For `x = 420` and `n = 69`, the divisors of `420` include `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `10`, `12`, `14`, `15`, `20`, `21`, `28`, `30`, `35`, `42`, `60`, `70`, `84`, `105`, `140`, `210`, and `420`. The valid divisors that are less than or equal to `69` are `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `10`, `12`, `14`, `15`, `20`, `21`, `28`, `30`, `35`, `42`, `60`. The pair divisors that are less than or equal to `69` are `420`, `210`, `140`, `105`, `84`, `70`, `60`, `42`, `35`, `30`, `28`, `21`, `20`, `15`, `14`, `12`, `10`, `7`, `6`, `5`, `4`, `3`, `2`, `1`. Therefore, the maximum balance is `6`.

The solution correctly identifies the largest possible divisor that satisfies the conditions for each test case.
