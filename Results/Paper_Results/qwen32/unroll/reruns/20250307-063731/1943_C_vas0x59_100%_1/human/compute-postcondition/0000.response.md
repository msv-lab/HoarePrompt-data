The code snippet provided only reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `u2vs` is a list of lists representing an adjacency list of a tree, and `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree. Since the code only reads an integer input and assigns it to `n`, the value of `n` will be updated to the integer provided by the input, but `u2vs` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers representing the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex (0-indexed); `n` is an input integer representing the number of vertices in the tree.**
