The code snippet provided executes a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the vertex `a`, which is the value returned by `func_1(d)`. The BFS updates the list `d` with the shortest distances from vertex `a` to all other vertices in the graph and returns a tuple containing the updated distances and a list `previous` that stores the previous vertex for each vertex in the shortest path from `a`.

Given the initial state, the variables `d` and `previous` are updated by the BFS function. The variable `u2vs` remains unchanged as it represents the graph structure and is not modified by the BFS function.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains the indices of vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex (0-indexed), representing an undirected graph (tree) structure; `d` is a list of shortest distances from vertex `a` to all other vertices in the graph; `previous` is a list where each element is the index of the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex `a` to the corresponding vertex. `a` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`.**
