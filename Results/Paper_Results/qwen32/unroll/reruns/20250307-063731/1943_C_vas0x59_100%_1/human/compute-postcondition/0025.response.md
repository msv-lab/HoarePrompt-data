Let's break down the problem step by step based on the initial state provided:

1. **Determine the Length of `path_ba`**:
   - `path_ba` is a list containing vertices from `b` to `a` in reverse order.
   - The length of `path_ba` can be either odd or even.

2. **Determine the Value of `ops` Based on the Length of `path_ba`**:
   - **If the length of `path_ba` is odd**:
     - `ops` is a list of tuples where each tuple is `(c, i)` with `c` being the middle element of `path_ba` and `i` ranging from `0` to `ci`, where `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`.
     - The middle index `ci` is calculated as `len(path_ba) // 2`.
     - The number of tuples in `ops` will be `ci + 1`.
   - **If the length of `path_ba` is even**:
     - `ops` is a list of tuples `[(c1, i), (c2, i)]` for each `i` in the range `1` to `len(path_ba) - ci1` with a step of `2`, where `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is the element at index `ci1` in `path_ba`, and `c2` is the element at index `ci2` in `path_ba`.
     - The number of tuples in `ops` will be `(len(path_ba) // 2) - 1` pairs, which translates to `2 * ((len(path_ba) // 2) - 1)` individual tuples.

3. **Determine the Length of `ops`**:
   - **If the length of `path_ba` is odd**:
     - The length of `ops` is `ci + 1` where `ci` is `len(path_ba) // 2`.
     - Therefore, the length of `ops` is `(len(path_ba) // 2) + 1`.
   - **If the length of `path_ba` is even**:
     - The length of `ops` is `2 * ((len(path_ba) // 2) - 1)`.

Given that we don't have the exact length of `path_ba`, we can describe the length of `ops` in terms of the length of `path_ba`.

Output: **len(ops) (where len(ops) is (len(path_ba) // 2) + 1 if the length of path_ba is odd, and 2 * ((len(path_ba) // 2) - 1) if the length of path_ba is even)**
