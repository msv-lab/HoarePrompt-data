The code `b = func_1(d)` assigns the value returned by `func_1(d)` to the variable `b`. The values of `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, and `a` remain unchanged. Since the specific implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we can only infer that `b` will hold whatever value `func_1(d)` returns.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains the indices of vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex (0-indexed), representing an undirected graph (tree) structure; `d` is a list of shortest distances from vertex `a` to all other vertices in the graph; `previous` is a list where each element is the index of the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex `a` to the corresponding vertex; `a` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`; `b` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`.**
