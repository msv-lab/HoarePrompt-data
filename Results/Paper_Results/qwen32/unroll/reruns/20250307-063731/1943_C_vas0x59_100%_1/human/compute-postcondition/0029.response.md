Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads an integer `n` and an adjacency list representing a tree with `n` vertices. It calculates the longest path in the tree, finds the middle of this path, and generates a list of operations based on whether the path length is odd or even. It then prints the number of operations and each operation in a specific format. The function does not return any value (returns `None`).**
