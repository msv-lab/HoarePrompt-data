`ci1` is assigned the value of `ci2 - 1`. Given that `ci2` is an integer equal to half the length of `path_ba`, the value of `ci1` will be one less than `ci2`. The other variables (`path_ba` and `ops`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in reverse order, `ops` is an empty list, `ci2` is an integer equal to half the length of `path_ba`, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`.**
