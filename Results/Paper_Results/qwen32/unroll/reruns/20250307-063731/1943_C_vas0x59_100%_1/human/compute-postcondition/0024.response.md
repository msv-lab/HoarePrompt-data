Postcondition: **`path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in reverse order. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list of tuples where each tuple is `(c, i)` with `c` being the middle element of `path_ba` and `i` ranging from `0` to `ci`, where `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list of tuples `[(c1, i), (c2, i)]` for each `i` in the range `1` to `len(path_ba) - ci1` with a step of `2`, where `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is the element at index `ci1` in `path_ba`, and `c2` is the element at index `ci2` in `path_ba`.**
