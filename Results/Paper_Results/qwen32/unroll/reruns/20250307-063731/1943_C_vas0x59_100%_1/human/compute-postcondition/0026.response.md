To determine the output, let's break down the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`path_ba`**: A list containing vertices from `b` to `a` in reverse order.
2. **`ops`**: A list of tuples that depends on the length of `path_ba`.
   - If the length of `path_ba` is **odd**, `ops` contains tuples of the form `(c, i)` where `c` is the middle element of `path_ba` and `i` ranges from `0` to `ci` (middle index).
   - If the length of `path_ba` is **even**, `ops` contains tuples of the form `[(c1, i), (c2, i)]` for each `i` in the range `1` to `len(path_ba) - ci1` with a step of `2`, where `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is the element at index `ci1` in `path_ba`, and `c2` is the element at index `ci2` in `path_ba`.

### Code Analysis:
The provided print statement uses the `map` function to apply a lambda function to each tuple in `ops`. The lambda function formats each tuple `(x[0], x[1])` as a string `f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'`. The `print` statement then prints these formatted strings, separated by newlines.

### Output Description:
- **If the length of `path_ba` is odd**:
  - The `ops` list contains tuples `(c, i)` where `c` is the middle element of `path_ba` and `i` ranges from `0` to `ci`.
  - Each tuple `(c, i)` will be formatted as `f'{c + 1} {i}'`.
  - The output will be a series of lines, each containing `c + 1` and `i`.

- **If the length of `path_ba` is even**:
  - The `ops` list contains tuples `[(c1, i), (c2, i)]` for each `i` in the specified range.
  - Each tuple `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` will be formatted as `f'{c1 + 1} {i}'` and `f'{c2 + 1} {i}'`, respectively.
  - The output will be a series of lines, each containing `c1 + 1` and `i`, followed by `c2 + 1` and `i`.

### Final Output:
Considering both cases, the output will be a series of formatted strings based on the contents of `ops`. Since the exact elements of `path_ba` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values of `c`, `c1`, and `c2`. However, we can describe the output format precisely.

Output: **Each line will contain a formatted string based on the elements of `ops`, where each element `x` in `ops` is formatted as `f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'`. The exact values depend on the contents of `path_ba`.**
