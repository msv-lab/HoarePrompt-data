The code calculates the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2 and assigns the result to `ci2`. Since `path_ba` has an even length, `ci2` will be an integer representing exactly half the length of `path_ba`. The values of `path_ba` and `ops` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in reverse order, `ops` is an empty list, and `ci2` is an integer equal to half the length of `path_ba`.**
