The code snippet `path_ba = [b]` initializes a new list named `path_ba` with a single element, which is the value of `b`. This does not affect the values of `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, or `b` directly, but it does introduce a new list `path_ba`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains the indices of vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex (0-indexed), representing an undirected graph (tree) structure; `d` is a list of shortest distances from vertex `a` to all other vertices in the graph; `previous` is a list where each element is the index of the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex `a` to the corresponding vertex; `a` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`; `b` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the value `b`.**
