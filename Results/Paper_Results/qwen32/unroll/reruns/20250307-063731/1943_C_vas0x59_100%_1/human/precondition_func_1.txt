u2vs is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers representing the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex (0-indexed). n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and it is guaranteed that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^3. The structure of u2vs is such that it represents an adjacency list of the tree.
