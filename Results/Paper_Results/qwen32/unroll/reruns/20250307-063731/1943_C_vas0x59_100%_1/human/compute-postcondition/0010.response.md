To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how it modifies the `path_ba` list.

### Loop Analysis:
- **Initialization**: `path_ba` starts with a single element, `b`.
- **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `n` (which is `previous[path_ba[-1]]`) is not `-1`.
- **Loop Body**: In each iteration, the loop appends the value of `n` (the previous vertex in the shortest path) to `path_ba`.
- **Termination**: The loop terminates when `n` becomes `-1`, which indicates that there are no more previous vertices in the path from `b` to `a`.

### Outcome:
- The loop effectively backtracks from vertex `b` to vertex `a` using the `previous` list, appending each vertex to `path_ba` until it reaches `a` (where `previous[a]` is `-1`).

### Output State:
- `path_ba` will contain the vertices from `b` to `a` in reverse order, i.e., starting from `b` and ending at `a`.

### Description:
- After the loop completes, `path_ba` will be a list that represents the shortest path from vertex `b` to vertex `a` in the graph, with `b` as the first element and `a` as the last element.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in reverse order.**

This means `path_ba` will start with `b` and end with `a`, with all intermediate vertices in between, forming the shortest path from `b` to `a` as determined by the `previous` list.
