Precondition: **s is an integer representing the starting vertex for the BFS (Breadth-First Search) traversal, n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, u2vs is a dictionary (or list of lists) where u2vs[u] contains all vertices v that are directly connected to vertex u by an edge.**
