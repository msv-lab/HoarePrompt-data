`ci` is assigned the value of `len(path_ba) // 2`. Since the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ci` will be the index of the middle element of `path_ba`. The state of `path_ba` and the fact that it has an odd length remain unchanged. `ops` remains an empty list as no changes are made to it.

Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in reverse order, and the length of `path_ba` is odd; `ops` is an empty list; `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`**.
