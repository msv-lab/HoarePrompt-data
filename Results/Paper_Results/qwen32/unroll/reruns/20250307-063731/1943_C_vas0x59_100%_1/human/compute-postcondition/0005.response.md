To determine the output state, we need to understand the function `func_1(d)`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code snippet, we can only assume that it takes the list `d` as an argument and returns some value `a`. The exact nature of `a` depends on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not given.

However, based on the information provided, we can infer that the variable `a` will be assigned the value returned by `func_1(d)`. The other variables `u2vs` and `d` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within `func_1`, which they are not in the provided code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains the indices of vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex (0-indexed), representing an undirected graph (tree) structure; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices in the graph; `a` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`**.
