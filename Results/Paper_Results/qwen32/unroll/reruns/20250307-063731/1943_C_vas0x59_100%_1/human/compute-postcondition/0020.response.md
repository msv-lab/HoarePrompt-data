The variable `c1` is assigned the value of the element at index `ci1` in the list `path_ba`. The values of `path_ba`, `ops`, `ci2`, and `ci1` remain unchanged. Since `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, and `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `c1` will hold the element that is one position before the middle of `path_ba`.

Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in reverse order, `ops` is an empty list, `ci2` is an integer equal to half the length of `path_ba`, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is the element at index `ci1` in `path_ba`.**
