You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: u2vs is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers representing the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex (0-indexed). n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and it is guaranteed that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^3. The structure of u2vs is such that it represents an adjacency list of the tree.
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        u -= 1
        
        v -= 1
        
        u2vs[u].append(v)
        
        u2vs[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains the indices of vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex (0-indexed), representing an undirected graph (tree) structure.
    d, _ = bfs(0)
    a = func_1(d)
    d, previous = bfs(a)
    b = func_1(d)
    path_ba = [b]
    while True:
        n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
        
        if n == -1:
            break
        
        path_ba.append(n)
        
    #State: `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in reverse order.
    ops = []
    if (len(path_ba) % 2 == 1) :
        ci = len(path_ba) // 2
        c = path_ba[ci]
        for i in range(ci + 1):
            ops.append((c, i))
            
        #State: `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in reverse order, and the length of `path_ba` is odd; `ops` is a list of tuples where each tuple is `(c, i)` with `c` being the middle element of `path_ba` and `i` ranging from `0` to `ci`; `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`; `c` is the element at index `ci` in `path_ba`.
    else :
        ci2 = len(path_ba) // 2
        ci1 = ci2 - 1
        c1 = path_ba[ci1]
        c2 = path_ba[ci2]
        for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - ci1, 2):
            ops.append((c1, i))
            
            ops.append((c2, i))
            
        #State: `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in reverse order, `ops` is a list of tuples `[(c1, i), (c2, i)]` for each `i` in the range `1` to `len(path_ba) - ci1` with a step of `2`, `ci2` is an integer equal to half the length of `path_ba`, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is the element at index `ci1` in `path_ba`, `c2` is the element at index `ci2` in `path_ba`.
    #State: `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in reverse order. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list of tuples where each tuple is `(c, i)` with `c` being the middle element of `path_ba` and `i` ranging from `0` to `ci`, where `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list of tuples `[(c1, i), (c2, i)]` for each `i` in the range `1` to `len(path_ba) - ci1` with a step of `2`, where `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is the element at index `ci1` in `path_ba`, and `c2` is the element at index `ci2` in `path_ba`.
    print(len(ops))
    #This is printed: len(ops) (where len(ops) is (len(path_ba) // 2) + 1 if the length of path_ba is odd, and 2 * ((len(path_ba) // 2) - 1) if the length of path_ba is even)
    print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
    #This is printed: Each line will contain a formatted string based on the elements of `ops`, where each element `x` in `ops` is formatted as `f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'`. The exact values depend on the contents of `path_ba`.
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `u2vs`, which is a list of lists representing an adjacency list of a tree, and `n`, an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree. The function does not return any value (returns `None`).

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
