Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in reverse order, `ops` is an empty list, `ci2` is an integer equal to half the length of `path_ba`, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is the element at index `ci1` in `path_ba`, `c2` is the element at index `ci2` in `path_ba`.**

In simpler terms: The variable `c2` is now assigned the value of the element at index `ci2` in the list `path_ba`. All other variables remain unchanged.
