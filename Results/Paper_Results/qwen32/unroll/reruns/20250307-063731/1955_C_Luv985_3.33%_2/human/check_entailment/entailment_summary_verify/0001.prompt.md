You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n`, a long integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates and prints the number of elements in the list `a` that can be reduced to 0 by performing operations that subtract pairs of elements from `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis
The problem involves `n` ships with given durability values that are attacked by the Kraken `k` times. The Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ship until either all ships are sunk or the Kraken runs out of attacks.

### Key Points:
1. **Attacks**: The Kraken attacks the first ship, then the last, and continues in this pattern.
2. **Sinking Ships**: When a ship's durability drops to 0, it sinks and is no longer considered in subsequent attacks.
3. **Output**: For each test case, the program should output the number of ships that have sunk after `k` attacks.

### Approach Analysis
The provided program uses a two-pointer technique to manage the first (`l`) and last (`r`) ships. It iteratively reduces the durability of these ships until either `k` attacks are exhausted or all ships are sunk.

### Detailed Steps of the Program:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - Read the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, read `n` (number of ships), `k` (number of attacks), and the list of durability values `a`.

2. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - Initialize `l = 0` (first ship) and `r = n - 1` (last ship).
   - Initialize `ans = 0` to count the number of sunk ships.

3. **Attack Loop**:
   - Continue the loop while `l < r` (i.e., there are more than one ship) and `k > 0` (i.e., the Kraken has remaining attacks).
   - Determine the minimum durability between the first and last ships (`mi = min(a[l], a[r])`).
   - If `mi * 2 <= k`:
     - Reduce the durability of both the first and last ships by `mi`.
     - Decrease `k` by `mi * 2`.
     - If the durability of the first ship becomes 0, increment `ans` and move the `l` pointer to the next ship.
     - If the durability of the last ship becomes 0, increment `ans` and move the `r` pointer to the previous ship.
   - If `mi * 2 > k`:
     - Calculate the remaining attacks `t = k % 2`.
     - Check if the first or last ship will sink with the remaining attacks. If so, increment `ans`.
     - Break out of the loop as no more attacks can be made.

4. **Single Ship Case**:
   - If `l == r`, check if the remaining attacks `k` are sufficient to sink the last ship. If so, increment `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - Print the number of sunk ships (`ans`) for each test case.

### Correctness Verification
The program correctly implements the logic described above:
- It correctly handles the alternating attack pattern.
- It properly updates the durability of ships and counts the number of sunk ships.
- It correctly handles the edge case where only one ship remains.

### Conclusion
The program appears to be correctly solving the problem as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
