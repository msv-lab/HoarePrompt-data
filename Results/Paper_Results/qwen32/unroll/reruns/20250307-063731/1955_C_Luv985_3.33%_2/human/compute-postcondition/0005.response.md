Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n`, a long integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates and prints the number of elements in the list `a` that can be reduced to 0 by performing operations that subtract pairs of elements from `k`.**
