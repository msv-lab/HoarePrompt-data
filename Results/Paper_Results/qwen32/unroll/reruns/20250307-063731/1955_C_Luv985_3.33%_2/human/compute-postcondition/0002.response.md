To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the variable `T` since it is the only variable in the loop condition. The loop will execute as long as `T` is truthy (i.e., `T > 0`).

Given that `T` is an integer read from the input, we need to ensure that `T` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute its first iteration.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
