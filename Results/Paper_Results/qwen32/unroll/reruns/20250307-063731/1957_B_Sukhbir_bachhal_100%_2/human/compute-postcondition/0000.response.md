Postcondition: **The function `func_1` takes a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) as input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of non-negative integers to be constructed and `k` is their sum. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. In the current test case, `n` equals 0.**
