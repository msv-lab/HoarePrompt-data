Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **High-Level Strategy**: The program is supposed to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers.

2. **Handling Single Element Case (n=1)**: 
   - When `n` is 1, the only integer to print is `k` itself. This is correctly handled by the program with the line `print(k)`.

3. **Handling Multiple Elements Case (n>1)**:
   - The program uses a function `func_1` to determine the highest bit position that is set in `k`. This function essentially calculates the position of the most significant bit in the binary representation of `k`.
   - The program then constructs the sequence by:
     - Adding `2 ** counter - 1` to the sequence, where `counter` is the result from `func_1(k)`. This value is the largest number with all bits set up to the highest bit of `k`. For example, if `k` is 5 (binary `101`), `counter` will be 2, and `2 ** 2 - 1` is 3 (binary `11`).
     - Adding the remainder `k - (2 ** counter - 1)` to the sequence.
     - Filling the remaining positions in the sequence with zeros until the length of the sequence is `n`.
   
4. **Maximizing the Number of 1s**:
   - By setting the first number to `2 ** counter - 1`, the program ensures that the highest bit of `k` is set in the bitwise OR of the sequence.
   - The remaining value `k - (2 ** counter - 1)` is added as the second number, and the rest of the sequence is filled with zeros.
   - This strategy ensures that the bitwise OR of the sequence has the maximum number of 1s possible, as the highest bit is set and the rest of the sequence contributes minimal additional 1s.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **n=1**: The program correctly prints `k`.
   - **k=1**: The program will correctly print `1` for `n=1` and `1 0` for `n>1`.
   - **k=2**: The program will correctly print `2` for `n=1` and `1 1` for `n>1`.
   - **k=3**: The program will correctly print `3` for `n=1` and `3 0` or `1 2` for `n>1`.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The program efficiently handles the constraints, especially since the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.

Given the above analysis, the program seems to correctly implement the strategy to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence while ensuring the sequence sums up to `k`.

**Correctness: True**
