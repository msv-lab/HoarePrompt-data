The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `n` is the number of non-negative integers to be constructed, and it is given that `n` is not equal to 0 for each test case. Since `n` is guaranteed to be non-zero based on the problem statement, no adjustment is needed for `n` to ensure the loop executes the first time.

Therefore, the state remains the same as it is right before the loop.

State: **The function `func_1` takes a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) as input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), where `n` is the number of non-negative integers to be constructed and `k` is their sum. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Additionally, `n` is not equal to 0. `position` is 0.**
