Postcondition: **The function `func_1` takes a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) as input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), where `n` is the number of non-negative integers to be constructed and `k` is their sum. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Additionally, `n` is not equal to 0.**
