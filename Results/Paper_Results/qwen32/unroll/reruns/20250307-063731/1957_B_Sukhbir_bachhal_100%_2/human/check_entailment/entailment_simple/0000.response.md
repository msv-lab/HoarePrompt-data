### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function `func_1` to see if the program correctly constructs a sequence of integers that satisfies the given conditions.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`.
   - We need to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - If `n > 1`, the program calls `func_1(k)` to find the position of the highest set bit in `k` (which is equivalent to finding the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`).
   - It then constructs the sequence by:
     - Setting the first element to `2 ** counter - 1` (which is the largest number with `counter` bits set to 1).
     - Setting the second element to `k - arr[-1]` (which ensures the sum of the sequence is `k`).
     - Filling the rest of the sequence with zeros.
   - If `n == 1`, the sequence is simply `[k]`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1(n)` calculates the position of the highest set bit in `n` by right-shifting `n` until it becomes 0, counting the number of shifts.
   - The returned value is `position - 1`, which gives the position of the highest set bit (0-indexed).

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly calculates the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and uses it to construct the first element of the sequence.
   - The second element is then calculated to ensure that the sum of the sequence is `k`.
   - The rest of the sequence is filled with zeros, which does not affect the bitwise OR.
   - For `n == 1`, the sequence is simply `[k]`, which trivially satisfies the conditions.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - **First Test Case:** `n = 1`, `k = 5`. Output: `5`. Correct.
   - **Second Test Case:** `n = 2`, `k = 3`. Output: `1 2`. Bitwise OR is `11` (binary), which has 2 ones. Correct.
   - **Third Test Case:** `n = 2`, `k = 5`. Output: `5 0`. Bitwise OR is `101` (binary), which has 2 ones. Correct.
   - **Fourth Test Case:** `n = 6`, `k = 51`. Output: `3 1 1 32 2 12`. Bitwise OR is `101111` (binary), which has 5 ones. Correct.

Based on the analysis, the program correctly constructs the sequence for each test case.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
