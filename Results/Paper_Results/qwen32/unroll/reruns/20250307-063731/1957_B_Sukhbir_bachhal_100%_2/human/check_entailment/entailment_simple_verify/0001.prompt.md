You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        position += 1
    return position - 1

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program and determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires constructing a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers.

### Key Points

1. **Sum Constraint**: The sum of the sequence must equal `k`.
2. **Maximize 1s in Bitwise OR**: The number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence should be maximized.

### Program Analysis

The program reads `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`. Depending on the value of `n`, it either outputs `k` directly (if `n = 1`) or constructs a sequence of length `n` with the first element being `2^counter - 1`, the second element being `k - (2^counter - 1)`, and the rest being 0s.

#### Function `func_1(n)`

- This function calculates the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n` and returns the exponent.
- For example, `func_1(5)` returns `2` because `2^2 = 4` is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to 5.

#### Sequence Construction

- If `n = 1`, the sequence is simply `[k]`.
- If `n > 1`, the sequence is constructed as follows:
  - The first element is `2^counter - 1`, where `counter` is the result of `func_1(k)`.
  - The second element is `k - (2^counter - 1)`.
  - The remaining `n - 2` elements are `0`.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through the example test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**: `n = 1`, `k = 5`
   - Output: `5`
   - Correct because the sum is `5` and the bitwise OR is `5` (binary `101`), which has 2 ones.

2. **Test Case 2**: `n = 2`, `k = 3`
   - `func_1(3)` returns `1` because `2^1 = 2` is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to 3.
   - Sequence: `1, 2`
   - Correct because the sum is `3` and the bitwise OR is `3` (binary `11`), which has 2 ones.

3. **Test Case 3**: `n = 2`, `k = 5`
   - `func_1(5)` returns `2` because `2^2 = 4` is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to 5.
   - Sequence: `3, 2`
   - Incorrect because the sum is `5` but the bitwise OR is `3` (binary `11`), which has only 2 ones. The correct sequence should be `5, 0` to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR (binary `101`, 3 ones).

4. **Test Case 4**: `n = 6`, `k = 51`
   - `func_1(51)` returns `5` because `2^5 = 32` is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to 51.
   - Sequence: `31, 20, 0, 0, 0, 0`
   - Incorrect because the sum is `51` but the bitwise OR is `31` (binary `11111`), which has only 5 ones. The correct sequence could be `31, 16, 2, 1, 1, 0` to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR (binary `111111`, 6 ones).

### Conclusion

The program does not always produce a sequence that maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
