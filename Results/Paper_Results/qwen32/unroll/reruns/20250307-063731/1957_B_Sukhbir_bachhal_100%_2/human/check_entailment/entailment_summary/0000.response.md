### Reasoning:
The provided Python program is intended to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR.

#### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Single Element Case (`n == 1`)**:
   - If `n == 1`, the program correctly outputs `k` because there's only one element in the sequence, and it must be equal to `k`.

2. **Multiple Elements Case (`n > 1`)**:
   - The program calculates the highest bit position in `k` using the `func_1` function. This position indicates the highest set bit in `k`.
   - It then constructs the sequence with the following steps:
     - It appends `2 ** counter - 1` to the sequence, which is a number with all bits set up to the highest bit position in `k` (e.g., if `k` is 5, `counter` is 2, and `2 ** 2 - 1` is 3).
     - It appends `k - (2 ** counter - 1)` to the sequence, making the sum of these two numbers equal to `k`.
     - It fills the remaining `n-2` positions with zeros.
   - This approach ensures that the bitwise OR of the sequence will have the maximum number of 1s because the first number in the sequence (`2 ** counter - 1`) has all bits set up to the highest bit position in `k`.

#### Analysis of the `func_1` Function:
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the position of the highest set bit in `n`. This is done by continuously right-shifting `n` until it becomes zero, counting the number of shifts.
- The function returns `position - 1` because the bit positions are 0-indexed.

### Conclusion:
The program is designed to meet the problem's requirements and correctly handles both cases (`n == 1` and `n > 1`). The `func_1` function accurately calculates the highest set bit position, which is crucial for constructing the sequence that maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.
