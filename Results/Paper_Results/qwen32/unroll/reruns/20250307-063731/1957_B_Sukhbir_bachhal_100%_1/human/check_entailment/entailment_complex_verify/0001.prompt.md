You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:

        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:

        return -1
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        position += 1
    return position - 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and n is not equal to 0.
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        
        position += 1
        
    #State: For each test case, `n` is 0 and `position` is the number of bits in the binary representation of the original `n`.
    return position - 1
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function returns -1 if `n` is 0; otherwise, it returns the position of the most significant bit in the binary representation of `n` minus one.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to see if it satisfies the conditions of the problem.

### Problem Recap:
The task is to generate a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Single Element Case (`n == 1`):**
   - If `n` is 1, the sequence must consist of the single element `k` because there's no other element to distribute the sum across.
   - The program correctly handles this by simply printing `k`.

3. **Multiple Elements Case (`n > 1`):**
   - The program uses a function `func_1(k)` to determine the highest bit position set in `k`.
   - The idea is to set the highest bit positions in the sequence to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.
   - `func_1(k)` returns the position of the most significant bit set in `k` (0-indexed). For example, for `k = 5` (binary `101`), `func_1(5)` returns `2`.
   - The program then constructs a sequence starting with `2 ** counter - 1`, which is a number with `counter + 1` bits set to 1 (e.g., for `counter = 2`, `2 ** 3 - 1 = 7`).
   - The remaining sum is then filled by the second element `k - arr[-1]`.
   - The rest of the elements are set to 0 to fill the sequence to `n` elements.

### Correctness Evaluation:

- **Maximizing 1s in Bitwise OR:**
  - The approach of setting the highest bits ensures that the number of 1s in the bitwise OR is maximized.
  - However, the program does not consider other possible distributions of `k` that might yield the same or more 1s in the bitwise OR.
  - For example, in the case of `n = 2` and `k = 5`, the program outputs `[7, -2]` which is incorrect since `-2` is not a non-negative integer. A correct output could be `[3, 2]` or `[1, 4]`.

- **Handling Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where `n = 1` by directly printing `k`.
  - However, the program may fail for other values of `n` and `k` due to incorrect handling of the distribution of `k`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not always generate a valid sequence of non-negative integers that maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR. Specifically, it may produce negative numbers and does not explore other possible distributions of `k` that could yield a higher number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
