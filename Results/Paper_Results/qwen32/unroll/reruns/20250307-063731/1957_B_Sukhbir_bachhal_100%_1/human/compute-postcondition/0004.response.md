To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `n != 0` is satisfied right before the loop starts. Given the state right before the loop:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each of the `t` test cases, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- `n` is not equal to 0.
- `position` is 0.

The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust `n` to ensure the loop can execute. Since it is given that `n` is not equal to 0, we do not need to change `n` to make the condition `n != 0` true. The condition is already satisfied based on the provided constraints.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and n is not equal to 0; `position` is 0**
