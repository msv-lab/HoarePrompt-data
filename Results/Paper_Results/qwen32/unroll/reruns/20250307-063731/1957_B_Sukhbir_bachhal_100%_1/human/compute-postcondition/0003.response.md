The code snippet provided initializes a variable `position` to 0. No other variables are affected. The initial state specifies conditions on `t`, `n`, and `k`, but these are not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and n is not equal to 0; `position` is 0.**
