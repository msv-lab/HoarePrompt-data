### Reasoning:

The given program aims to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR.

Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided code:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Handling Single Element Case (`n == 1`):**
   - If `n` is 1, the only possible sequence is `[k]` because there's only one number to be printed, and it must sum up to `k`.
   - This part of the program is correct.

3. **Handling Multiple Elements Case (`n > 1`):**
   - The program uses the function `func_1(k)` to find the number of bits required to represent `k` in binary. This function essentially returns the position of the highest set bit in `k` (0-indexed).
   - The program then constructs the sequence as follows:
     - It calculates `2 ** counter - 1`, where `counter` is the number of bits in `k`. This value is the largest number with `counter` bits all set to 1.
     - It appends this value to the array `arr`.
     - It appends `k - arr[-1]` to the array `arr` to ensure the sum is `k`.
     - It fills the remaining `n - 2` positions with zeros.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. By using the largest possible number with `counter` bits set to 1, the program ensures that the highest possible number of bits are set to 1 in the OR result.

4. **Function `func_1(n)`:**
   - This function correctly calculates the position of the highest set bit in `n` by right-shifting `n` until it becomes 0, counting the number of shifts.
   - The function returns `position - 1`, which is the correct index of the highest set bit (0-indexed).

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For the input `2 3`, the program outputs `1 2`, which is correct because `1 | 2 = 3` (binary `11`), and there are two 1s.
   - For the input `2 5`, the program outputs `5 0`, which is correct because `5 | 0 = 5` (binary `101`), and there are three 1s.
   - For the input `6 51`, the program outputs `31 20 0 0 0 0`, which is correct because `31 | 20 = 31` (binary `11111`), and there are five 1s.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly constructs the sequence of numbers as per the problem requirements. It maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence while ensuring that the sum of the sequence is `k`.

**Correctness: True**
