Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. The current implementation does not ensure that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR is maximized. 

Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `n > 1` Case**: The program uses a function `func_1` to find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and then constructs the sequence with `2**counter - 1` and `k - (2**counter - 1)`. This approach does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

2. **No Consideration for Multiple Numbers**: The program only considers two numbers in the sequence when `n > 1`, and fills the rest with zeros. This approach does not explore other possibilities that might yield a higher number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

3. **No Handling for Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where `k` is a power of 2 or other edge cases that might require a different approach to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

To solve the problem correctly, one should aim to distribute the sum `k` among the `n` numbers in such a way that the bitwise OR of the sequence has the maximum number of 1s. This can be achieved by considering the binary representation of `k` and distributing the bits among the numbers in the sequence.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n == 1:
        arr.append(k)
    else:
        # Distribute k among n numbers to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR
        while k > 0 and len(arr) < n:
            # Find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to k
            counter = 0
            temp_k = k
            while temp_k != 0:
                temp_k >>= 1
                counter += 1
            highest_power_of_2 = 2 ** (counter - 1)
            arr.append(highest_power_of_2)
            k -= highest_power_of_2
        # Fill the rest with 0s if needed
        while len(arr) < n:
            arr.append(0)
    print(*arr)
```

This version of the program attempts to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR by distributing the sum `k` among the `n` numbers using the highest possible powers of 2. However, it still might not be optimal for all cases, and further refinement might be necessary to ensure correctness for all possible inputs.
