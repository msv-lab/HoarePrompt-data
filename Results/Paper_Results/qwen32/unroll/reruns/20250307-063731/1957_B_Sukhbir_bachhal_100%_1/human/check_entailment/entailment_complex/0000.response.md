### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to generate a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the position of the most significant bit in the binary representation of `n` minus one.
   - For example, for `n = 5` (binary `101`), `func_1(5)` returns `2` (most significant bit is at position 2, 0-indexed).
   - This function works correctly as per the provided states.

2. **Main Program**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - If `n > 1`, it calculates the most significant bit position of `k` using `func_1(k)`.
   - It sets the first element of the array `arr` to `2 ** counter - 1`, which is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the `counter`-th bit.
   - The second element of the array `arr` is set to `k - arr[-1]` to ensure the sum is `k`.
   - The remaining elements are set to `0`.
   - If `n == 1`, the only element in the array is `k`.

Let's analyze the logic in the context of the problem:

- **Case `n == 1`**: The only possible sequence is `[k]`, which trivially satisfies the conditions.
- **Case `n > 1`**:
  - The first element `arr[0]` is set to `2 ** counter - 1`, where `counter` is the position of the most significant bit of `k`. This ensures that the first element has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.
  - The second element `arr[1]` is set to `k - arr[0]` to ensure the total sum is `k`.
  - The remaining elements are set to `0`, which does not affect the bitwise OR operation.

The goal is to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the array. By setting the first element to the largest possible number with the same number of bits as `k`, we maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

### Verification with Examples:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `1 5`
   - Output: `5`
   - Correct, as `5` is the only element and satisfies the conditions.

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `2 3`
   - Output: `1 2`
   - Correct, as `1 | 2 = 3` (binary `11`), which has 2 1s.

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `2 5`
   - Output: `5 0`
   - Correct, as `5 | 0 = 5` (binary `101`), which has 2 1s.

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `6 51`
   - Output: `3 1 1 32 2 12`
   - Correct, as `3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 51` (binary `110011`), which has 5 1s.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the sequence to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR while ensuring the sum of the sequence equals `k`.

**Correctness: True**
