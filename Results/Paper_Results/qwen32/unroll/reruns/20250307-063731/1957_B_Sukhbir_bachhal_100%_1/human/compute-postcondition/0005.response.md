To determine the output state after the loop executes all its iterations, let's analyze the loop.

The loop:
```python
while n != 0:
    n >>= 1
    position += 1
```
This loop continuously shifts the bits of `n` to the right by one position (equivalent to integer division by 2) until `n` becomes 0. Each time `n` is shifted, the `position` variable is incremented by 1.

The number of iterations the loop runs is equal to the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary form, excluding the leading zeros. This is essentially the position of the most significant bit (MSB) in the binary representation of `n`.

For example:
- If `n` is 1 (binary `0001`), the loop will run 1 time, and `position` will be 1.
- If `n` is 2 (binary `0010`), the loop will run 2 times, and `position` will be 2.
- If `n` is 3 (binary `0011`), the loop will run 2 times, and `position` will be 2.
- If `n` is 4 (binary `0100`), the loop will run 3 times, and `position` will be 3.

In general, for any integer `n`, the loop will run until `n` becomes 0, and `position` will be equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`, which is `floor(log2(n)) + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is 0 and `position` is the number of bits in the binary representation of the original `n` (i.e., `floor(log2(original n)) + 1`).**

Since the problem specifies multiple test cases, for each test case, `n` will be reduced to 0, and `position` will be updated to reflect the number of bits in the binary representation of the original `n`.

Output State: **For each test case, `n` is 0 and `position` is the number of bits in the binary representation of the original `n`.**
