The function `highest_set_bit` is expected to take a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). However, based on the problem description, the main function that needs to be defined to solve the problem should take two integers `n` and `k` for each test case, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. Additionally, there are `t` test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
