Initial State: `n` is 0 and `position` is the number of bits in the binary representation of the original `n`.

The binary representation of 0 is '0', which can be considered to have 1 bit (the bit representing the absence of any value). Therefore, `position` is 1.

The code returns `position - 1`, which is `1 - 1`.

Output State: **The program returns 0**.
