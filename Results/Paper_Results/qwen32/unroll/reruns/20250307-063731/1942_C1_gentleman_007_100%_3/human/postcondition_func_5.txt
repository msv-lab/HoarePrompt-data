The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` representing the number of sides of a polygon and `m` representing the number of vertices that can be used to form diagonals. It returns a 2D list `l` with dimensions (n+1) x (n+1) where `l[x][y]` and `l[y][x]` are set to 1 for `m` unique pairs `(x, y)` obtained from `func_1()`, and all other elements are 0.
