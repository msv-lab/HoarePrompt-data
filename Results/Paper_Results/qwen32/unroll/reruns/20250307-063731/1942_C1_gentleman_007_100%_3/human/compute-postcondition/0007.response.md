The code snippet `s = ''.join(l)` joins the elements of the list `l` into a single string `s`. 

Given that `l` contains the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b` in reverse order, after this operation, `s` will be the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b` in the correct order (since `''.join(l)` reverses the reversed order).

The variables `i` and `j` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `l` contains the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b` in reverse order, `s` is the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b` in the correct order.**
