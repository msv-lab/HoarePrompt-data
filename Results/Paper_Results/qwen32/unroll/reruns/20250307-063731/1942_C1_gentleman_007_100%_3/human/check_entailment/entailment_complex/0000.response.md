### Reasoning:

The given problem requires calculating the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing vertices from a regular polygon. Given that \( y = 0 \), no additional vertices can be chosen, and we must work with the vertices already chosen by Bessie.

The provided code iterates over each test case, reads the number of sides of the polygon \( n \), the number of vertices chosen \( x \), and the vertices themselves. It then sorts the vertices and calculates the number of triangles that can be formed based on the given conditions.

Let's break down the logic in the main part of the code:

1. **Reading Input:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
       (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
       arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
   ```
   This correctly reads the number of test cases, the number of sides \( n \), the number of vertices \( x \), and the vertices themselves.

2. **Sorting the Vertices:**
   ```python
   arr.sort()
   ```
   Sorting the vertices helps in easily identifying consecutive vertices.

3. **Calculating Triangles:**
   ```python
   ans = x - 2
   for i in range(1, x):
       if arr[i - 1] + 2 == arr[i]:
           ans += 1
   if arr[x - 1] == n - 1 and arr[0] == 1:
       ans += 1
   if arr[x - 1] == n and arr[0] == 2:
       ans += 1
   ```
   - `ans = x - 2` initializes the answer with the number of triangles that can be formed with the given vertices minus 2 (since at least 2 vertices are needed to form a triangle).
   - The loop checks for consecutive vertices that are exactly 2 units apart, which would allow forming an additional triangle.
   - The two `if` conditions handle the cases where the first and last chosen vertices form a triangle with the vertices 1 and \( n \) or 2 and \( n \), respectively.

4. **Output:**
   ```python
   print(ans)
   ```
   This prints the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

Now, let's consider the provided functions. The code does not actually use most of the functions listed (e.g., `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, etc.). The functions are defined but not called or used in the main logic. This suggests that either these functions are part of a larger codebase or they are intended for other purposes not relevant to this specific problem.

### Conclusion:

The main logic of the code correctly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake based on the given vertices. The functions that are not used do not affect the correctness of the solution for this specific problem.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
