The code snippet `q.append(ver)` adds the vertex `ver` to the end of the deque `q`. Since `q` was initially empty, after this operation, `q` will contain only the vertex `ver`. The values of `ver`, `graph`, and `vis` remain unchanged as they were not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` contains all the adjacent vertices to `ver`, and `vis` is a list or dictionary used to keep track of visited vertices such that `vis[node]` is 1 if the node has been visited and 0 otherwise; `q` is a deque containing the single element `ver`.**
