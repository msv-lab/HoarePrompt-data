Functionality: **The function `func_25` accepts a parameter `ver`, which is an integer representing a vertex in the graph. It also accepts `graph`, which is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` contains all the adjacent vertices to `ver`. Additionally, it accepts `vis`, which is a list or dictionary used to keep track of visited vertices such that `vis[node]` is 1 if the node has been visited and 0 otherwise. The function returns the result of a traversal or search operation starting from the vertex `ver`, marking nodes as visited in the `vis` list or dictionary.**
