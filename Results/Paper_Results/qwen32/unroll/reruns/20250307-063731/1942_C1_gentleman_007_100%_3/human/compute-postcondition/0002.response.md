Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` contains all the adjacent vertices to `ver`, and `vis` is a list or dictionary used to keep track of visited vertices such that `vis[node]` is 1 if the node has been visited and 0 otherwise; `q` is a deque containing the single element `ver`. `vis[ver]` is 1.**

Natural Language: The vertex `ver` has been marked as visited by setting `vis[ver]` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
