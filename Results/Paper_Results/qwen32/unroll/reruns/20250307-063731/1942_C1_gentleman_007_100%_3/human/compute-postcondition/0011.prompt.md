You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, and mod is an integer where mod can be -1 or any other integer value.
def func_16(n, mod):
    if (mod == -1) :
        dearr = [1, 0]
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            dearr.append((i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2]))
            
        #State: `n` is a positive integer, `mod` is -1, `dearr` is `[1, 0, 1, 2, 9, ..., (n-1) * (dearr[n-1] + dearr[n-2])]`
    else :
        dearr = [1, 0]
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            dearr.append((i - 1) % mod * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2]) % mod % mod)
            
        #State: `dearr` is a list of `n + 1` elements starting with `[1, 0]` and followed by the computed values for each `i` from `2` to `n` using the formula `((i - 1) % mod) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2]) % mod`.
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, and `mod` is an integer where `mod` can be -1 or any other integer value. If `mod` is -1, `dearr` is `[1, 0, 1, 2, 9, ..., (n-1) * (dearr[n-1] + dearr[n-2])]`. Otherwise, `dearr` is a list of `n + 1` elements starting with `[1, 0]` and followed by the computed values for each `i` from `2` to `n` using the formula `((i - 1) % mod) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2]) % mod`.
    return dearr
    #The program returns `dearr`, which is a list starting with `[1, 0]` and followed by computed values based on the formula `(i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2])` if `mod` is -1, or `((i - 1) % mod) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2]) % mod` if `mod` is any other integer value.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_16` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer, and `mod`, which is an integer that can be -1 or any other integer value. The function returns a list `dearr` starting with `[1, 0]`. If `mod` is -1, the subsequent values in the list are computed using the formula `(i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2])`. If `mod` is any other integer value, the subsequent values are computed using the formula `((i - 1) % mod) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2]) % mod`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `dearr`, which is a list starting with `[1, 0]` and followed by computed values based on the formula `(i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2])` if `mod` is -1, or `((i - 1) % mod) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2]) % mod` if `mod` is any other integer value.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
