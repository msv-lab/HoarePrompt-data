You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ver is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, graph is a dictionary or list of lists where graph[ver] contains all the adjacent vertices to ver, and vis is a list or dictionary used to keep track of visited vertices such that vis[node] is 1 if the node has been visited and 0 otherwise.
def func_25(ver):
    q = deque()
    q.append(ver)
    vis[ver] = 1
    while len(q):
        ver = q.popleft()
        
        print(ver, end=' ')
        
        for node in graph[ver]:
            if not vis[node]:
                q.append(node)
                vis[node] = 1
        
    #State: `q` is an empty deque, `vis` has 1s for all vertices that were visited during the BFS traversal, and all reachable vertices from `ver` have been printed in BFS order.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_25` accepts a parameter `ver`, which is an integer representing a vertex in the graph. It also accepts `graph`, which is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` contains all the adjacent vertices to `ver`. Additionally, it accepts `vis`, which is a list or dictionary used to keep track of visited vertices such that `vis[node]` is 1 if the node has been visited and 0 otherwise. The function returns the result of a traversal or search operation starting from the vertex `ver`, marking nodes as visited in the `vis` list or dictionary.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
