The code snippet provided initializes a variable `q` as an empty deque. This operation does not affect the values of `ver`, `graph`, or `vis`. Therefore, the state of these variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` contains all the adjacent vertices to `ver`, and `vis` is a list or dictionary used to keep track of visited vertices such that `vis[node]` is 1 if the node has been visited and 0 otherwise; `q` is an empty deque.**
