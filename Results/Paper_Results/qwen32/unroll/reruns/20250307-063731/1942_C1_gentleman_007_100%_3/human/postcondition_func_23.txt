The function `func_24` performs a depth-first traversal of a graph starting from a given vertex `ver`. It uses a stack to keep track of vertices to visit and a list or dictionary `vis` to mark vertices as visited. After the traversal, all reachable nodes from `ver` are marked as visited in `vis`, and the function prints each visited vertex. The stack is empty at the end of the function's execution.
