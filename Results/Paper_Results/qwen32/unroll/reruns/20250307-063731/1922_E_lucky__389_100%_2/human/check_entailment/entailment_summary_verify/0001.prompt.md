You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

- Program:
import math

MOD = 1000000007
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if x == 2:
        print(1)
        print(0)
        return
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
    print(len(ansv))
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `x` from the input, computes a sequence of exponents related to the powers of 2 that sum up to `x`, and prints the length of this sequence followed by the sequence itself. If `x` is 2, it directly prints 1 and 0. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The given program attempts to solve the problem by constructing an array that has exactly X increasing subsequences. The approach taken in the program is to decompose X into a sum of powers of 2 and then construct the array based on these powers. However, there are several issues with this approach:

1. **Decomposition of X**: The program tries to decompose X into a sum of distinct powers of 2. This is a good start because the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be related to the number of ways to choose elements, which is often related to binary representations and powers of 2.

2. **Constructing the Array**: The program constructs the array based on the exponents of the powers of 2 that sum up to X. However, the way the array is constructed does not guarantee that the number of increasing subsequences will be exactly X. Specifically, the way the list `ansv` is constructed does not ensure that all possible increasing subsequences are counted correctly.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles the case where X is 2 by returning an array of length 1 with a single element. However, for other values of X, the construction of the array does not guarantee the correct number of increasing subsequences.

4. **Output Format**: The program correctly formats the output, but the correctness of the output depends on the correctness of the array construction.

5. **Example Verification**: The provided examples in the problem statement do not match the output produced by the given program. For instance, for X = 5, the program might not produce an array that has exactly 5 increasing subsequences.

Given these issues, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct array for all values of X within the given constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is False.

Correctness: **False**
