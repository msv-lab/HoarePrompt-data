Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program aims to find an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences. However, there are a few issues with the current implementation:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Subsequences**: The program attempts to decompose the number of subsequences (X) into powers of 2, which is not the correct approach for generating the required array. The logic for generating the array based on the decomposed values is flawed and does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly X increasing subsequences.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle cases where X is not a sum of distinct powers of 2 correctly. For example, if X is a prime number greater than 2, the program will fail to generate a valid array because it will only consider powers of 2.

3. **Array Generation**: The generated array does not guarantee the required number of increasing subsequences. The array generation logic is incorrect and does not consider the properties of increasing subsequences properly.

4. **Output Formatting**: The program prints the array elements without handling the case where the array length is 0, which should not happen as per the problem description.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the failure of the program:

**Input:**
```
1
3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
0 1
```
or
```
2
1 2
```
or any other valid array of length 2 with exactly 3 increasing subsequences.

**Actual Output:**
```
1
0
```

The actual output is incorrect because it only generates an array with 2 increasing subsequences (the empty subsequence, `[0]`, and `[0]` itself), not 3.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all potential cases, and thus the correctness is **False**.
