You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

Example

Input

    4
    
    2
    
    5
    
    13
    
    37

Output

    1
    0
    3
    0 1 0
    5
    2 2 3 4 2
    7
    -1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1

- Program:
import math

MOD = 1000000007
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if x == 2:
        print(1)
        print(0)
        return
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
    print(len(ansv))
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `x` from the input, computes a sequence of exponents related to the powers of 2 that sum up to `x`, and prints the length of this sequence followed by the sequence itself. If `x` is 2, it directly prints 1 and 0. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program aims to find an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences. However, there are a few issues with the current implementation:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Subsequences**: The program attempts to decompose the number of subsequences (X) into powers of 2, which is not the correct approach for generating the required array. The logic for generating the array based on the decomposed values is flawed and does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly X increasing subsequences.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle cases where X is not a sum of distinct powers of 2 correctly. For example, if X is a prime number greater than 2, the program will fail to generate a valid array because it will only consider powers of 2.

3. **Array Generation**: The generated array does not guarantee the required number of increasing subsequences. The array generation logic is incorrect and does not consider the properties of increasing subsequences properly.

4. **Output Formatting**: The program prints the array elements without handling the case where the array length is 0, which should not happen as per the problem description.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the failure of the program:

**Input:**
```
1
3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
0 1
```
or
```
2
1 2
```
or any other valid array of length 2 with exactly 3 increasing subsequences.

**Actual Output:**
```
1
0
```

The actual output is incorrect because it only generates an array with 2 increasing subsequences (the empty subsequence, `[0]`, and `[0]` itself), not 3.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all potential cases, and thus the correctness is **False**.
