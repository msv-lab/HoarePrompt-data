Let's break down the problem step by step based on the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `x` is initialized to 0.
2. `subseq_lens` contains the exponents of the powers of 2 subtracted from the initial `x`. Since `x` is 0, the exponents of the powers of 2 that sum to 0 are none. Therefore, `subseq_lens` is an empty list `[]`.
3. `mx` is the maximum of the exponents in `subseq_lens`. Since `subseq_lens` is empty, `mx` is 0.
4. `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx - 1` with additional elements from `subseq_lens` starting from index 1 appended to it. Since `mx` is 0, the list of integers from 0 to `mx - 1` is an empty list `[]`. Additionally, `subseq_lens` starting from index 1 is also an empty list `[]` because `subseq_lens` is empty. Therefore, `ansv` is an empty list `[]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(len(ansv))
```

### Calculation:
- `len(ansv)` calculates the length of the list `ansv`.
- Since `ansv` is an empty list `[]`, its length is 0.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the length of `ansv`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
