Let's analyze the given program and its behavior compared to the problem description.

### Reasoning:

1. **Base Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the base case where `X = 2`. It outputs `1` followed by `0`, which is a valid array with exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence `[0]`.

2. **General Case:**
   - For `X > 2`, the program aims to find a sequence of exponents of powers of 2 that sum up to `X`. This is done using a greedy approach where the largest possible power of 2 is subtracted from `X` until `X` becomes 0.
   - The exponents collected in `subseq_lens` represent the lengths of increasing subsequences that can be formed.
   - The array `ansv` is constructed to reflect these lengths. It starts with a sequence of integers from `0` to `mx - 1` (where `mx` is the maximum exponent found) and then appends the remaining exponents from `subseq_lens` (excluding the first one).

3. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the length of `ansv` followed by the elements of `ansv`. This length is the length of the array, and the elements represent the values in the array.

4. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The approach of using powers of 2 to represent the number of increasing subsequences is rooted in the fact that the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be constructed by combining subsequences of different lengths. Each power of 2 corresponds to a unique set of subsequences that can be formed.
   - The program ensures that the array length is at most 200 by leveraging the properties of binary representation and the constraints on `X`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `X` is a power of 2 by outputting an array that reflects the binary representation of `X`.
   - For other values of `X`, the program decomposes `X` into a sum of powers of 2 and constructs an array accordingly.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences for each test case. It handles the base case and the general case appropriately and ensures that the output meets the problem requirements.

**Correctness: True**
