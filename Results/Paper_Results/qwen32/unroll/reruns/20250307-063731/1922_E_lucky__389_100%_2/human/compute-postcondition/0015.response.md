Given the initial state:
- `x` is 0
- `subseq_lens` contains the exponents of the powers of 2 subtracted from the initial `x`. Since `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` would be an empty list `[]`.
- `mx` is the maximum of these exponents. Since `subseq_lens` is empty, `mx` would be 0.
- `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx - 1` with additional elements from `subseq_lens` starting from index 1 appended to it. Since `mx` is 0, the range `0 to mx - 1` is `0 to -1`, which is an empty range. Thus, `ansv` would be `[]`.

The loop iterates over `ansv` and prints each element followed by a space. Since `ansv` is an empty list, the loop will not execute any iterations, and nothing will be printed.

Therefore, the output state will remain the same as the initial state, except for the fact that the loop will not print anything.

Output State: **x is 0, subseq_lens is [], mx is 0, ansv is [].**
