Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
2. For each of the t test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18.
3. `x` is the integer value read from input and its current value is 2.
4. `subseq_lens` is an empty list.
5. `mx` is 0.

### Code Snippet
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis
The print statement `print(1)` is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `X`, `x`, `subseq_lens`, or `mx`. The value `1` is explicitly provided in the print statement.

### Output
The print statement will output the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
