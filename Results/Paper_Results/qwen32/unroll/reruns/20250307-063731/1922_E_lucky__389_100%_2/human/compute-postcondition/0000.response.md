The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer between 2 and 10^18. The provided code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to `x`. This means that `x` is now assigned the value of the integer input, and the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, X is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is the integer value read from input.**
