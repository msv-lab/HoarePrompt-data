Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `array`, which is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to n, and a parameter `find`, which is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n) that needs to be found in the permutation. The function returns a list containing two string elements: the first element is the string representation of `l + 1`, where `l` is the index of the first element in the array after any necessary swaps, and the second element is the string representation of the index of `find` in the array plus one after performing at most 2 swaps to locate `find`.**
