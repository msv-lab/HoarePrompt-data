Functionality: **The function takes a list `array`, which is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and an integer `find`. It performs a search to find the position of `find` in the list. If the position found by a modified binary search does not match the actual position of `find` in the list, it returns a list of two string elements representing the positions (1-indexed) involved in a potential swap to locate `find`. If the positions match, it returns a list indicating no swap is needed.**
