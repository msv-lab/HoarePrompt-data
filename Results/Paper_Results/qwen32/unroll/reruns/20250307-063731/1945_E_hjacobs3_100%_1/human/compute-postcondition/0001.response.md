Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`). `n` is the length of `array`. `l` is 0, `r` is `n`.**

In natural language: The initial state of `array` and `find` remains unchanged. The variables `l` and `r` have been assigned the values 0 and `n`, respectively.
