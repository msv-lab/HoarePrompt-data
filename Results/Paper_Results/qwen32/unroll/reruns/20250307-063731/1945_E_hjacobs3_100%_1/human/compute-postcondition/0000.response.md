The code snippet provided assigns the length of the list `array` to the variable `n`. No other variables are modified, and the values of `array` and `find` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`). `n` is the length of `array`.**
