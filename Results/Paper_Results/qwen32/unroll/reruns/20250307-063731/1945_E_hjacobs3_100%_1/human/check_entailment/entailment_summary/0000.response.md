### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem by performing at most two swaps to ensure that after applying a binary search, the element at position `l` is equal to `x`.

However, there are several issues with the current implementation:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search algorithm in `func_1` is not correctly implemented for the problem requirements. The binary search should be applied to a sorted array to find the correct position of `x`. Since the array is not sorted, the binary search will not yield the correct index of `x` in a sorted array.

2. **Logic for Swaps**: The logic for determining the swaps is flawed. The code checks if the binary search result `l` matches the actual index of `x` in the unsorted array. If they do not match, it suggests a swap. However, this does not guarantee that after two swaps, the binary search will yield the correct result because the binary search is not being performed on a sorted array.

3. **Output Format**: The output format of the function is incorrect. The function is expected to return the number of swaps and the positions of the elements to be swapped. However, the function currently prints the number of swaps and returns the positions as a list of strings, which is inconsistent with the problem's requirements.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The main loop correctly handles multiple test cases, but the function `func_1` does not address the problem correctly as described above.

### Conclusion:

The current implementation does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
