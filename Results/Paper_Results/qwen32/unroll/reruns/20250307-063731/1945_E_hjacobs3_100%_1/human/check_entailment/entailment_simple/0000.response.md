Reasoning:
The given program is intended to solve the problem by performing at most two swaps in the permutation array to ensure that after applying a modified binary search, the element at the position `l` is equal to `x`.

However, there are several issues with the provided `func_1` function:

1. **Binary Search Off-by-One Error**: The binary search implementation has an off-by-one error. The loop condition `while r - l > 1` is correct, but the initial values of `l` and `r` should be `0` and `n` respectively, which is correctly done. However, the `mid` calculation is correct, but the logic to update `l` and `r` is correct as well. The issue lies in the interpretation of `l` and `r` after the loop.

2. **Incorrect Index Handling**: After the loop, `l` is supposed to be the largest index such that `array[l] <= find`. However, the program checks if `l` is equal to `array.index(find)`, which is not necessarily true because `array.index(find)` returns the first occurrence of `find` in the array, which might not be the same as `l`.

3. **Output Format**: The function is supposed to return a list of strings representing the operations to be performed. However, the function prints the number of operations instead of returning it.

4. **Logic for Two Swaps**: The function only handles the case where one swap is necessary. It does not consider the scenario where two swaps are required.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function does not guarantee that the binary search will find `x` at position `l` after at most two swaps, and it does not handle all possible cases.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
