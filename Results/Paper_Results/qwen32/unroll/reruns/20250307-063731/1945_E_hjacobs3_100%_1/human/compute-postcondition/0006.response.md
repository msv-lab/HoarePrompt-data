Output State: **The program returns a list containing two string elements: the first element is the string representation of `l + 1`, and the second element is the string representation of the index of `find` in the array plus one.**

In natural language, this means the program returns a list with two string values. The first value is the number `l + 1` converted to a string, and the second value is the position of `find` in the array plus one, also converted to a string.
