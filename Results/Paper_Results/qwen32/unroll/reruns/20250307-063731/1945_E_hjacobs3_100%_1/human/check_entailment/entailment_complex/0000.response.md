### Reasoning:

The function `func_1` is supposed to determine whether a single swap is needed to make the binary search algorithm correctly identify the position of the element `find` in the permutation `array`. If a swap is needed, it identifies the indices of the elements to swap. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `l` to 0 and `r` to `n` (the length of the array). This sets up the binary search bounds.

2. **Binary Search Loop**: The loop continues as long as `r - l > 1`. Inside the loop:
   - `mid` is calculated as the integer division of `(l + r) // 2`.
   - If the element at `mid` is less than or equal to `find`, `l` is updated to `mid`.
   - Otherwise, `r` is updated to `mid`.

3. **Post-Loop Check**: After the loop, `l` is the largest index such that `array[l] <= find` and `r` is `l + 1`. The function then checks if `l` is equal to the index of `find` in the array:
   - If `l` is not equal to the actual index of `find`, it means the binary search would not correctly identify `find`. Therefore, the function prints `1` and returns the indices of `l + 1` and the actual index of `find` (both 1-indexed) to indicate a swap is needed.
   - If `l` is equal to the actual index of `find`, the function prints `0` and returns an empty list, indicating no swap is needed.

### Issues in the Provided Code:
- **Indexing Off-by-One Error**: The function uses `l + 1` and `array.index(find) + 1` to return the indices. However, `l` is already a 0-indexed position, so adding 1 to `l` is correct. But `array.index(find)` returns a 0-indexed position as well, so adding 1 to it is also correct. However, the function should ensure that it correctly identifies the need for a swap and that the swap will indeed make the binary search successful. The current implementation does not guarantee this.
- **Logic for Swaps**: The function only checks if `l` is equal to the index of `find`. However, it does not ensure that the swap will make the binary search successful. It needs to ensure that after the swap, the binary search can correctly identify `find`.

### Correctness:
The provided code does not guarantee that the binary search will correctly identify `find` after the swap. It only checks if `l` is equal to the index of `find` and suggests a swap if not. However, it does not ensure that the swap will make the binary search successful. Therefore, the correctness of the program is questionable based on the provided logic.

**Correctness: False**

The function needs to be more robust to ensure that the swap will indeed make the binary search successful. It should consider the positions of elements around `find` and ensure that the swap will place `find` in a position where the binary search can correctly identify it.
