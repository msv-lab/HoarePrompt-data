The `while` loop condition is `r - l > 1`. To ensure that the loop can execute at least once, the condition `r - l > 1` must be true right before the loop starts.

Given the initial state:
- `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
- `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`).
- `n` is the length of `array`.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n`.

The only variables in the loop head are `l` and `r`. According to the condition `r - l > 1`, we need to ensure that `r - l` is greater than 1.

Given that `l` is 0 and `r` is `n`, the condition `r - l > 1` translates to `n > 1`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be greater than 1.

No other states need to be adjusted as only `l` and `r` are in the loop head and `l` is already set to 0, which is fixed.

State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`), `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n`**
