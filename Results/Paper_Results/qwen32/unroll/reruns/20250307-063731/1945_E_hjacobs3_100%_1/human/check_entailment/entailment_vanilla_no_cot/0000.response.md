Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Here are the key issues with the program:

1. **Indexing Error**: The program uses 0-based indexing for the array, but the problem specifies 1-based indexing for the output. Therefore, the indices returned in the output are incorrect.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The program does not ensure that after performing at most two swaps, the binary search will correctly identify the position of `x`. The current logic only checks if the element at position `l` after binary search is `x` and performs one swap if it is not. This is not sufficient to guarantee that the binary search will correctly identify `x` after at most two swaps in all cases.

3. **Output Handling**: The program prints the number of swaps before returning the swap operations, which is correct, but the swap operations themselves are not correctly generated in all cases.

4. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is supposed to return the operations needed to perform the swaps, but it prints the number of operations directly, which is not consistent with the problem's requirement to print the operations after the number of operations.

To fix the program, you need to implement a strategy that ensures after at most two swaps, the binary search will correctly identify the position of `x`. This involves carefully choosing the swaps to ensure that the binary search algorithm will converge to the correct position of `x`. The current implementation does not address this requirement correctly.
