Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as per the problem description. Specifically, the program only handles one swap operation, but the problem states that up to two swaps can be performed. Additionally, the program does not guarantee that the binary search will correctly identify the target element after the swaps.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
2 4
1 5
```

Explanation of the expected output:
- Perform the first swap between indices 2 and 4 to get the array [4, 5, 1, 3, 2, 6].
- Perform the second swap between indices 1 and 5 to get the array [2, 5, 1, 3, 4, 6].
- After these swaps, a binary search starting with `l = 1` and `r = 7` will correctly identify `p_l = 3` after two iterations.

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
1
1 2
```

Explanation of the actual output:
- The program performs only one swap between indices 1 and 2, resulting in the array [3, 4, 1, 5, 2, 6].
- After this swap, a binary search starting with `l = 1` and `r = 7` will not correctly identify `p_l = 3` because the array is not in a state that would allow the binary search to converge to the correct position with just this one swap.

Thus, the program does not handle the case correctly and is therefore incorrect.
