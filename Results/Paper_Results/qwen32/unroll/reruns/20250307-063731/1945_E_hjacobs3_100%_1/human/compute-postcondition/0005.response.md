The `print` statement in the given code snippet is simply `print(1)`. This statement will output the integer `1` regardless of the values of the variables `l`, `r`, `array`, or `find` mentioned in the initial state.

Let's break down the context for clarity:
- `l` is defined as the largest index such that `array[l]` is less than or equal to `find`.
- `r` is defined as `l + 1`.
- The current value of `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in the array.

None of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement directly outputs the integer `1`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1**
