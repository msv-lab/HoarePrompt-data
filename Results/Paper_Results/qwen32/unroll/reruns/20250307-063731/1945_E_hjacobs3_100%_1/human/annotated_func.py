#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to n, and find is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n) that needs to be found in the permutation using a modified binary search algorithm with at most 2 swaps.
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
        
    #State: `l` is the largest index such that `array[l]` is less than or equal to `find`, and `r` is `l + 1`.
    if (l != array.index(find)) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
        #The program returns a list containing two string elements: the first element is the string representation of `l + 1`, and the second element is the string representation of the index of `find` in the array plus one.
    else :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: `l` is the largest index such that `array[l]` is less than or equal to `find`, and `r` is `l + 1`. Additionally, `l` is equal to `array.index(find)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list `array`, which is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and an integer `find`. It performs a search to find the position of `find` in the list. If the position found by a modified binary search does not match the actual position of `find` in the list, it returns a list of two string elements representing the positions (1-indexed) involved in a potential swap to locate `find`. If the positions match, it returns a list indicating no swap is needed.
