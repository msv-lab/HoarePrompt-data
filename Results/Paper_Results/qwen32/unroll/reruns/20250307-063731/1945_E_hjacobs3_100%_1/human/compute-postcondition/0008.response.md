The `print(0)` statement in the provided code snippet will print the integer `0`. The value to be printed is explicitly stated in the code and does not depend on the variables `l`, `r`, `array`, or `find`. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. The initial state describes the values and relationships of the variables `l`, `r`, `array`, and `find`.
2. The `print(0)` statement is independent of these variables and simply outputs the integer `0`.

Therefore, the output of the code will be:
Output: **0**
