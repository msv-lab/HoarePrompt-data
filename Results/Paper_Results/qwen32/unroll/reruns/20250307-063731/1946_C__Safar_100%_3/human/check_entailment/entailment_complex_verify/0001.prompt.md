You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` determines the maximum number of connected components that can be formed by removing `k` edges from a tree with `n` vertices. It accepts three parameters: `n`, the number of vertices; `k`, the number of edges to be removed; and `edges`, a list of tuples representing the edges between vertices. The function prints and returns the maximum number of connected components achievable under these conditions.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `check` determines whether a tree, represented by an adjacency list `g`, has at least `k` nodes whose subtree size is at least `A`. It returns `True` if this condition is met or if the entire tree's size is at least `A` and exactly `k` nodes meet the subtree size condition; otherwise, it returns `False`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's break down the logic and see if it aligns with the problem requirements.

### Problem Breakdown
The problem asks to find the maximum number \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges from a tree with \( n \) vertices in such a way that each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.

### Program Analysis
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(n, k, edges)`: This function sets up the adjacency list for the graph and uses binary search to find the maximum possible \( x \).
2. `check(A)`: This function checks if it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges such that each remaining connected component has at least \( A \) vertices.

### Detailed Analysis

#### `func_1(n, k, edges)`
- **Graph Construction**: The adjacency list `g` is constructed from the given edges.
- **Binary Search**: The binary search is performed on the possible values of \( x \) (from 1 to \( n // k \)). The binary search is used to find the maximum \( x \) for which `check(A)` returns `True`.

#### `check(A)`
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: The function uses DFS to traverse the tree and count the sizes of connected components.
- **Component Size Check**: If a component's size is at least \( A \), it increments the count of such components. If a component's size is less than \( A \), it adds its size to its parent component.
- **Final Check**: After the traversal, it checks if the number of components is greater than \( k \) or if the size of the root component is at least \( A \) and the number of components is exactly \( k \).

### Correctness Check
1. **Graph Construction**: The adjacency list is correctly constructed.
2. **Binary Search**: The binary search range is from 1 to \( n // k \), which is appropriate since the maximum possible \( x \) cannot exceed \( n // k \) (otherwise, it would be impossible to have \( k \) components each of size \( x \)).
3. **DFS and Component Size Check**: The DFS correctly traverses the tree and calculates the sizes of connected components. The logic to merge sizes of smaller components into their parent is correct.
4. **Final Check**: The final check correctly ensures that either the number of components is greater than \( k \) or the size of the root component is at least \( A \) and the number of components is exactly \( k \).

### Conclusion
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It uses binary search to efficiently find the maximum \( x \) and a DFS to verify the feasibility of each \( x \).

Correctness: **True**
