The code snippet initializes an empty set called `visited`. This does not affect the values of `A`, `g`, `k`, or `stack`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the `visited` set.

Output State: **A is a positive integer, g is an adjacency list representing the tree with n vertices, k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, stack is [(1, 1)], visited is an empty set**.
