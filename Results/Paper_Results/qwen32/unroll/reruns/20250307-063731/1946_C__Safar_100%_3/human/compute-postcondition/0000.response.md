Output State: **A is a positive integer, g is an adjacency list representing the tree with n vertices, and k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n; stack is [(1, 1)]**

In this output state, the variable `stack` has been initialized with the tuple `(1, 1)`. All other variables (`A`, `g`, `k`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
