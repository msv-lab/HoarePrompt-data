t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, each set of input data consists of an integer n and k where 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, and edges is a list of (n-1) pairs of integers (v, u) where 1 <= v, u <= n representing the edges of the tree. The sum of all n values across all sets of input data does not exceed 10^5.
