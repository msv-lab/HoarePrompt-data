In this case, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute at least once regardless of the program state. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **A is a positive integer, g is an adjacency list representing the tree with n vertices, k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, stack is [(1, 1)], visited is an empty set, d is {1: 1}, r is 0**
