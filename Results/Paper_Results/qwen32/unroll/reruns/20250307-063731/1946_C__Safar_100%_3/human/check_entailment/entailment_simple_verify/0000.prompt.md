You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/799bacd3be0dda357800fdfc3eadbf38ab259c51.png)

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that suggest it may not work correctly for all potential cases:

1. **Global Variable Usage**: The function `check(A)` references a global variable `g` which is defined in `func_1(n, k, edges)`. This makes the code less modular and harder to understand, and can lead to issues if `g` is not properly initialized or if multiple instances of the function are called.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle edge cases where the tree might be a star graph or a degenerate tree (a path). For these cases, the logic might not correctly determine the maximum number `x`.

3. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search implementation in `func_1` uses `r = n // k` as the initial upper bound. While this is a reasonable guess, it might not cover all edge cases, especially when `k` is small or when the tree is not evenly partitionable.

4. **Component Size Calculation**: The logic in `check(A)` for calculating the size of each component and determining if the number of components is valid might not handle all scenarios correctly. For example, if the tree has a structure where removing `k` edges results in components of different sizes, the logic might not correctly identify the maximum `x`.

5. **Visited Set and Dictionary**: The use of `visited` set and `d` dictionary in `check(A)` is not entirely clear and might not correctly handle all scenarios, especially when the tree has cycles or when the tree structure is more complex.

To verify the correctness of the program, we need to ensure that it handles all edge cases and scenarios correctly. Given the complexity of the problem and the potential for edge cases, it is prudent to consider more comprehensive testing and verification.

Here is a potential test case that might reveal an issue:

```
Input:
1
5 2
1 2
1 3
1 4
1 5

Expected Output:
2

Explanation:
Removing edges (1, 2) and (1, 3) results in three components of size 1, 1, and 3. The maximum x such that each component has at least x vertices is 2.
```

In this test case, the program might not correctly identify the maximum `x` due to the way components are being calculated and checked. Therefore, the program is not fully correct and should be reviewed and potentially revised to handle all cases correctly.
