To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's break down the logic and see if it aligns with the problem requirements.

### Problem Breakdown
The problem asks to find the maximum number \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges from a tree with \( n \) vertices in such a way that each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.

### Program Analysis
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(n, k, edges)`: This function sets up the adjacency list for the graph and uses binary search to find the maximum possible \( x \).
2. `check(A)`: This function checks if it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges such that each remaining connected component has at least \( A \) vertices.

### Detailed Analysis

#### `func_1(n, k, edges)`
- **Graph Construction**: The adjacency list `g` is constructed from the given edges.
- **Binary Search**: The binary search is performed on the possible values of \( x \) (from 1 to \( n // k \)). The binary search is used to find the maximum \( x \) for which `check(A)` returns `True`.

#### `check(A)`
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: The function uses DFS to traverse the tree and count the sizes of connected components.
- **Component Size Check**: If a component's size is at least \( A \), it increments the count of such components. If a component's size is less than \( A \), it adds its size to its parent component.
- **Final Check**: After the traversal, it checks if the number of components is greater than \( k \) or if the size of the root component is at least \( A \) and the number of components is exactly \( k \).

### Correctness Check
1. **Graph Construction**: The adjacency list is correctly constructed.
2. **Binary Search**: The binary search range is from 1 to \( n // k \), which is appropriate since the maximum possible \( x \) cannot exceed \( n // k \) (otherwise, it would be impossible to have \( k \) components each of size \( x \)).
3. **DFS and Component Size Check**: The DFS correctly traverses the tree and calculates the sizes of connected components. The logic to merge sizes of smaller components into their parent is correct.
4. **Final Check**: The final check correctly ensures that either the number of components is greater than \( k \) or the size of the root component is at least \( A \) and the number of components is exactly \( k \).

### Conclusion
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It uses binary search to efficiently find the maximum \( x \) and a DFS to verify the feasibility of each \( x \).

Correctness: **True**
