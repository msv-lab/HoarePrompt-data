Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed to correctly solve the problem:

1. **Global Variable `g`:** The adjacency list `g` is defined inside `func_1`, but it is used in `check` without being passed as an argument. This will cause a `NameError` in `check` because `g` is not recognized in its scope.

2. **Return Value of `check`:** The function `check` is supposed to return a boolean value indicating whether it is possible to partition the tree into at least `k+1` connected components, each of size at least `A`. However, the current logic incorrectly handles the case when the root node itself is a component of size at least `A` and `r == k`.

3. **Edge Case Handling:** The check function does not correctly handle the case when the tree can be partitioned into exactly `k+1` components, each of size at least `A`, and the root node is part of one of these components.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        g[b].append(a)

    def check(A):
        stack = [(1, 1)]
        visited = set()
        d = {1: 1}
        r = 0
        while stack:
            (x, p) = stack[-1]
            if x not in visited:
                visited.add(x)
                d[x] = 1
                for node in g[x]:
                    if node != p:
                        stack.append((node, x))
            else:
                if x == 1:
                    break
                if d[x] >= A:
                    r += 1
                else:
                    d[p] += d[x]
                stack.pop()
                del d[x]
        return r >= k and d[1] < A or r > k

    l = 1
    r = n // k
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
    print(r)

# Example usage:
# t = int(input())
# for _ in range(t):
#     n, k = map(int, input().split())
#     edges = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n - 1)]
#     func_1(n, k, edges)
```

This corrected version ensures that the adjacency list `g` is passed correctly to the `check` function, and the logic for checking the partitioning conditions is corrected.
