The function `func_1` determines the maximum number of connected components that can be formed by removing `k` edges from a tree with `n` vertices. It accepts three parameters: `n`, the number of vertices; `k`, the number of edges to be removed; and `edges`, a list of tuples representing the edges between vertices. The function prints and returns the maximum number of connected components achievable under these conditions.
