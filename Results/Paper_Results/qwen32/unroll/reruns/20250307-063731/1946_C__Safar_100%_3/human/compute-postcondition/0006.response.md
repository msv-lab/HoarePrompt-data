Postcondition: **stack is [], visited is set(), d is {}, r is the number of nodes whose subtree size is at least A, and either r is greater than k or d[1] is at least A and r equals k.**

This postcondition retains all the conditions from the precondition and includes the condition that must be true for the if statement to be entered.
