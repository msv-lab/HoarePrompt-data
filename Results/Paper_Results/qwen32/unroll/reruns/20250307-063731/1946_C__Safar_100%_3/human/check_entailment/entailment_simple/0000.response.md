### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by performing a binary search on the possible sizes of the connected components after removing `k` edges. It uses a depth-first search (DFS) to count the number of connected components of a given minimum size `A` that can be formed by removing `k` edges.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the code:

1. **Input Parsing and Function Calls:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of vertices) and `k` (number of edges to remove).
   - It then reads the `n-1` edges of the tree.
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case. However, the function calls are not stored in the list `q` as intended, and the second loop that processes `q` is redundant and does not execute because `q` remains empty.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It constructs an adjacency list `g` from the edges.
   - It performs a binary search on the size of the connected components (`A`).
   - For each middle value `mid` in the binary search, it calls `check(mid)` to determine if it's possible to partition the tree into at least `k` components where each component has at least `mid` vertices.

3. **Function `check(A)`:**
   - It performs a DFS to count the number of subtrees of size at least `A`.
   - It maintains a count `r` of such subtrees.
   - It returns `True` if there are exactly `k` such subtrees or if the entire tree can be a single component of size at least `A` after removing `k` edges.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Issues:
- The list `q` is not being populated with the test cases, and the second loop that processes `q` is never executed.
- The function `check(A)` correctly implements the logic to verify if a given size `A` is feasible, but it is not being called correctly due to the issue with `q`.

### Correctness:
Despite the issue with the list `q`, the logic inside `func_1` and `check(A)` appears to be correct. The binary search and DFS logic are sound and should work correctly if the test cases were properly passed to `func_1`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program would be correct if the issue with the list `q` were fixed. However, as it stands, the program does not execute as intended due to the unpopulated list `q`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program is logically correct in terms of its algorithm, but it has a structural issue that prevents it from processing the test cases as intended.
