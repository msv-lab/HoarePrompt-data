Functionality: **The function `check` determines whether a tree, represented by an adjacency list `g`, has at least `k` nodes whose subtree size is at least `A`. It returns `True` if this condition is met or if the entire tree's size is at least `A` and exactly `k` nodes meet the subtree size condition; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
