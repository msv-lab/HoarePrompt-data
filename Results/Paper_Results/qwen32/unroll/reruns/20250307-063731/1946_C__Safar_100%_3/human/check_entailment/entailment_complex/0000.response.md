### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program to see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges to be removed `k`.
   - It then reads the edges of the tree.

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - The program constructs an adjacency list `g` for the tree using the edges.

3. **Binary Search for Maximum `x`**:
   - The program uses binary search to find the maximum `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges and have each remaining connected component of size at least `x`.
   - The search range for `x` is from `1` to `n // k`.

4. **Checking Feasibility with Function `check`**:
   - The `check` function determines if it's possible to have at least `k` connected components, each of size at least `A`, after removing `k` edges.
   - It uses a depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree and calculate the sizes of the subtrees.
   - It counts the number of subtrees whose sizes are at least `A`.
   - It returns `True` if the number of such subtrees is greater than `k` or if the entire tree's size is at least `A` and exactly `k` subtrees meet the condition.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum `x` for each test case.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Graph Representation**: The adjacency list `g` correctly represents the tree.
- **Binary Search**: The binary search is correctly implemented to find the maximum `x` within the range `[1, n // k]`.
- **Feasibility Check (`check` function)**: The `check` function correctly uses DFS to traverse the tree and count the number of subtrees of size at least `A`. It also correctly checks if the entire tree's size is at least `A` when exactly `k` subtrees meet the condition.
- **Output**: The program correctly prints the maximum `x` for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It efficiently finds the maximum `x` using binary search and the `check` function to determine the feasibility of the solution.

**Correctness: True**
