### Reasoning:
The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Function `func_1`:
This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. The execution summary matches the expected behavior of the function.

#### Function `func_2`:
This function is responsible for calculating the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\). However, the implementation provided does not align with the problem's requirements. Let's analyze why:

The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \(k\). This can be simplified to:
\[ a = (k - 1) \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]

Given this, for each \(b\), \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This means \(a\) must be of the form \(a = b \cdot d \cdot t\) where \(d = \gcd(a, b)\) and \(t\) is an integer. The correct approach would involve iterating over possible values of \(b\) and checking valid \(a\) values.

However, the provided `func_2` does not follow this logic. It instead calculates a value `cnt` using a formula that does not correspond to the problem's constraints. The formula used in `func_2` seems to be derived from a different problem or a misinterpretation of the current problem.

### Conclusion:
Given that `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, the entire program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
