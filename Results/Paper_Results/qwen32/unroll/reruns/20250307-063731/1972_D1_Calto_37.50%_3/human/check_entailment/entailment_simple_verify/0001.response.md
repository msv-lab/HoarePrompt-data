### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).

#### Function `func_2(n, m)`:
- `cnt = 0`: Initialize a counter to zero.
- `for i in range(1, m)`: Loop through all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m-1\).
  - `x = n - (i * i - i)`: Calculate \(x\) using the formula \(n - (i^2 - i)\).
  - `y = i * i`: Calculate \(y\) as \(i^2\).
  - `cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`: Update the counter by adding the integer division of \(x\) by \(y\) plus 1 if \(i > 1\).
- `if cnt == 0`: If the counter is zero, return 1.
- `return cnt`: Otherwise, return the counter.

#### Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- The gcd function correctly computes the greatest common divisor.
- The `func_2` function iterates from 1 to \(m-1\) and performs calculations based on the formula \(n - (i^2 - i)\) and \(i^2\).

#### Issues in the Program:
The formula used in `func_2` does not align with the problem's requirements. The problem asks us to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), but the provided function does not perform this check. Instead, it uses a different formula that does not correspond to the problem statement.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\). This can be done using nested loops, but due to the constraints, an efficient approach is required.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem according to the given requirements.
