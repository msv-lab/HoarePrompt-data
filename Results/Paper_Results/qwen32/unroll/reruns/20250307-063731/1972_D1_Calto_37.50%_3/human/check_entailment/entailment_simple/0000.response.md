### Reasoning:

The provided program includes two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm, which is correct. However, `func_2` is supposed to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The implementation of `func_2` seems to be incorrect based on the problem description and the annotated states.

The logic in `func_2` does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it performs a series of operations involving integer divisions and sums that do not align with the problem's requirements.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the given condition directly. However, this approach would be inefficient given the constraints. Instead, a more optimized approach would be required, possibly involving mathematical insights or precomputations.

Given the annotated states and the logic in `func_2`, it is clear that the function does not correctly solve the problem as described.
