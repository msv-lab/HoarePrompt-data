### Reasoning

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program code to determine if the original assessment is accurate or not.

#### Problem Recap
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Program Analysis
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

#### Function `func_2(n, m)`
The function `func_2` is described in the function summary as:
- Initializing `cnt` to zero.
- Looping through all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m-1\).
- Calculating `x` as \(n - (i * i - i)\) and `y` as \(i * i\).
- Updating the counter by adding the integer division of `x` by `y` plus 1 if \(i > 1\).
- Returning 1 if `cnt` is zero, otherwise returning `cnt`.

#### Issues in the Program
The formula used in `func_2` does not align with the problem's requirements. The problem requires checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The provided function does not perform this check but instead uses a different formula that does not relate to the problem's conditions.

#### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\). Given the constraints, a more efficient approach might be needed, but the provided function does not implement this logic.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the program is incorrect.
