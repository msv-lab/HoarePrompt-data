You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

    2 3
    
    3 5

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Problem Description Recap:
For each test case, given two integers \( n \) and \( m \), we need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \( 1 \le a \le n \)
2. \( 1 \le b \le m \)
3. \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \)

### Provided Program:
```python
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
    if cnt == 0:
        return 1
    return cnt
```

### Analysis:
#### Function 1 (`func_1`):
This function seems to be an implementation of the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers \( a \) and \( b \). However, it is not used in the provided code snippet `func_2`, which suggests that this function might be intended for another part of the solution but is not utilized here.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`):
This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \( n \) and \( m \). However, the logic inside `func_2` does not seem to align with the problem description.

Let's break down the logic of `func_2`:
- It initializes a counter `cnt` to 0.
- It iterates over \( i \) from 1 to \( m-1 \).
- For each \( i \), it calculates \( x = n - (i * i - i) \) and \( y = i * i \).
- It updates the counter `cnt` by adding \( x // y + (i > 1) \).
- If `cnt` is 0, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Logic Mismatch**: The provided logic in `func_2` does not seem to correctly implement the condition \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).
2. **Missing gcd Calculation**: The program does not use the gcd calculation at all, which is a crucial part of the problem description.
3. **Incorrect Loop Range**: The loop runs from 1 to \( m-1 \), but it should consider all pairs \((a, b)\) where \( 1 \le a \le n \) and \( 1 \le b \le m \).
4. **Incorrect Pair Counting**: The way pairs are counted does not match the problem's requirement.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. It fails to properly count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) according to the given conditions.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \). It misses the gcd calculation and incorrectly counts the pairs, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.
