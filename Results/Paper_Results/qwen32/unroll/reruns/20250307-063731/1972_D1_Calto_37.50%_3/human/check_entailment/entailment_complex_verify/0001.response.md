### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not align with the problem requirements. Let's break down the reasoning in more detail:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Provided Program Analysis**:
   - `func_1(a, b)`: This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - `func_2(n, m)`: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\), but it does not implement the correct logic.

3. **Issues in `func_2`**:
   - The logic in `func_2` involves calculations using \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\), and then updating the counter based on these values. This logic does not correspond to checking whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The provided function does not iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the required condition.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This can be computationally expensive, but efficient algorithms can be designed to handle the constraints.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described.
