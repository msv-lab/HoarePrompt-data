### Reasoning:

The given problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's analyze the provided code:

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. This function is not directly used in the provided `func_2` but is described as such.

2. **Function `func_2(n, m)`**:
   - This function is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given `n` and `m`.
   - The logic in `func_2` seems incorrect based on the problem description. The function iterates over `i` from 1 to `m-1` and calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`. It then sums up the integer division `x // y` and adds `m-2` to the count if `i > 1`. If the final count is 0, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns the count.
   - This approach does not correctly implement the logic required to count pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The current implementation does not account for the GCD condition and does not properly iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\).

### Correctness:
Given the analysis above, the provided `func_2` does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
