### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided code systematically.

#### Problem Recap:
For each test case, given two integers \( n \) and \( m \), we need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \( 1 \le a \le n \)
2. \( 1 \le b \le m \)
3. \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \)

#### Provided Code Analysis:

**Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a
```
- This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( a \) and \( b \).

**Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
    if cnt == 0:
        return 1
    return cnt
```
- This function does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem.
- The loop iterates from 1 to \( m-1 \), but it does not consider all pairs \((a, b)\) where \( 1 \le a \le n \) and \( 1 \le b \le m \).
- The calculation inside the loop does not match the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).
- The function does not use the gcd calculation at all, which is essential for the problem.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) holds. Here is a correct implementation:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count
```

#### Comparison with Provided Code:
- The provided code (`func_2`) does not correctly implement the required logic.
- It misses the gcd calculation and incorrectly counts the pairs, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. It fails to properly count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) according to the given conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
