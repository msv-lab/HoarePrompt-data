You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
    if cnt == 0:
        return 1
    return cnt



- Annotated Code: 
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_2(n, m)
    print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: a is the greatest common divisor of the initial values of a and b, and b is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of the initial values of a and b, and since b is 0, the program returns a.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`. It returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these two integers.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
        
    #State: `cnt` is the sum of `n` and the integer divisions `(n - i * (i - 1)) // (i * i)` for `i` from 2 to `m-1`, plus `m-2`.
    if (cnt == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: `cnt` is the sum of `n` and the integer divisions `(n - i * (i - 1)) // (i * i)` for `i` from 2 to `m-1`, plus `m-2`. Additionally, `cnt` is not equal to 0.
    return cnt
    #The program returns the value of `cnt`, which is the sum of `n` and the integer divisions `(n - i * (i - 1)) // (i * i)` for `i` from 2 to `m-1`, plus `m-2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integer parameters `n` and `m`. It calculates a value `cnt` by summing `n` and the integer divisions `(n - i * (i - 1)) // (i * i)` for each `i` from 2 to `m-1`, plus `m-2`. If `cnt` is 0, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns the value of `cnt`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Provided Program Analysis
The given program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).

However, the implementation of `func_2` seems to be incorrect or at least not aligned with the problem requirements. Let's break down the logic in `func_2`:

#### Function `func_2(n, m)`
- `cnt = 0`: Initialize a counter to zero.
- `for i in range(1, m)`: Loop through all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m-1\).
  - `x = n - (i * i - i)`: Calculate \(x\) using the formula \(n - (i^2 - i)\).
  - `y = i * i`: Calculate \(y\) as \(i^2\).
  - `cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`: Update the counter by adding the integer division of \(x\) by \(y\) plus 1 if \(i > 1\).
- `if cnt == 0`: If the counter is zero, return 1.
- `return cnt`: Otherwise, return the counter.

### Issues in the Program
The formula used in `func_2` does not align with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the problem asks us to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), which is not what the provided function does.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\). This can be done using nested loops, but due to the constraints, an efficient approach is required.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
