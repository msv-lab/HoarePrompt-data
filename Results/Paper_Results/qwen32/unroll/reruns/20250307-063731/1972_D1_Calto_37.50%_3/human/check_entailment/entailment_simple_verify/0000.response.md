### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

#### Problem Description Recap:
For each test case, given two integers \( n \) and \( m \), we need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \( 1 \le a \le n \)
2. \( 1 \le b \le m \)
3. \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \)

#### Provided Program:
```python
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
    if cnt == 0:
        return 1
    return cnt
```

#### Analysis:
#### Function 1 (`func_1`):
This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers \( a \) and \( b \). However, it is not used in `func_2`, which is a significant issue since the gcd calculation is crucial for solving the problem.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`):
This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \( n \) and \( m \). However, the logic inside `func_2` does not align with the problem description.

Let's break down the logic of `func_2`:
- It initializes a counter `cnt` to 0.
- It iterates over \( i \) from 1 to \( m-1 \).
- For each \( i \), it calculates \( x = n - (i * i - i) \) and \( y = i * i \).
- It updates the counter `cnt` by adding \( x // y + (i > 1) \).
- If `cnt` is 0, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Logic Mismatch**: The provided logic in `func_2` does not implement the condition \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).
2. **Missing gcd Calculation**: The program does not use the gcd calculation at all, which is a crucial part of the problem description.
3. **Incorrect Loop Range**: The loop runs from 1 to \( m-1 \), but it should consider all pairs \((a, b)\) where \( 1 \le a \le n \) and \( 1 \le b \le m \).
4. **Incorrect Pair Counting**: The way pairs are counted does not match the problem's requirement.

### Annotations:
The annotations provided do not reflect the correct logic for counting the valid pairs. They describe the state of the variables at certain points, but these states do not correspond to the correct implementation of the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. It fails to properly count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) according to the given conditions.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \). It misses the gcd calculation and incorrectly counts the pairs, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
