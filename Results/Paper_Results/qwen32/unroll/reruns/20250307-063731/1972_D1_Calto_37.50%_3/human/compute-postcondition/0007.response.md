Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integer parameters `n` and `m`. If both `n` and `m` are provided within the constraints (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6), the function returns 1 in Case_1. Otherwise, in Case_2, it returns the value of `cnt`, which is calculated as the sum of `n` and the integer divisions `(n - i * (i - 1)) // (i * i)` for each `i` from 2 to `m-1`, plus `m-2`.**
