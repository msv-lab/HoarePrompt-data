Let's carefully analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Problem Description Recap:
For each test case, given two integers \( n \) and \( m \), we need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \( 1 \le a \le n \)
2. \( 1 \le b \le m \)
3. \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \)

### Provided Program:
```python
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
    if cnt == 0:
        return 1
    return cnt
```

### Analysis:
#### Function 1 (`func_1`):
This function seems to be an implementation of the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers \( a \) and \( b \). However, it is not used in the provided code snippet `func_2`, which suggests that this function might be intended for another part of the solution but is not utilized here.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`):
This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \( n \) and \( m \). However, the logic inside `func_2` does not seem to align with the problem description.

Let's break down the logic of `func_2`:
- It initializes a counter `cnt` to 0.
- It iterates over \( i \) from 1 to \( m-1 \).
- For each \( i \), it calculates \( x = n - (i * i - i) \) and \( y = i * i \).
- It updates the counter `cnt` by adding \( x // y + (i > 1) \).
- If `cnt` is 0, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Logic Mismatch**: The provided logic in `func_2` does not seem to correctly implement the condition \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).
2. **Missing gcd Calculation**: The program does not use the gcd calculation at all, which is a crucial part of the problem description.
3. **Incorrect Loop Range**: The loop runs from 1 to \( m-1 \), but it should consider all pairs \((a, b)\) where \( 1 \le a \le n \) and \( 1 \le b \le m \).
4. **Incorrect Pair Counting**: The way pairs are counted does not match the problem's requirement.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. It fails to properly count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) according to the given conditions.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \). It misses the gcd calculation and incorrectly counts the pairs, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.
