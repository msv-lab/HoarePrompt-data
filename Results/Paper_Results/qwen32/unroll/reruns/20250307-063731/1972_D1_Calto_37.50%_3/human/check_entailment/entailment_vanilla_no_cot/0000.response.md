Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect based on the problem description. The program's logic in `func_2` does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

Here is a brief explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation Logic**: The function `func_2` does not correctly iterate through all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check the condition. Instead, it uses a formula that does not guarantee the correct count of valid pairs.

2. **Missing Iteration Over `b`**: The function only iterates `b` from `1` to `m-1`, and it does not iterate through all possible values of `a` for each `b`. It also does not compute the gcd for each pair `(a, b)`.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**: The function does not handle the case where `b == 1` correctly, and the logic to add `(i > 1)` is unclear and incorrect for the given problem.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate through all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check if the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` holds. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

# Function to calculate gcd
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

# Function to count valid pairs
def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

# Main function to handle multiple test cases
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        m = int(input[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Uncomment the following line to run the main function
# main()
```

This corrected program iterates through all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checks the condition, ensuring that the count of valid pairs is accurate.
