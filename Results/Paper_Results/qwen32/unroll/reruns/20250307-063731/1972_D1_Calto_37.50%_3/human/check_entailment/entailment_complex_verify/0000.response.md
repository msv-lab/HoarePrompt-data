### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the provided program and its annotated version against the problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
The task is to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \( 1 \le a \le n \)
2. \( 1 \le b \le m \)
3. \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \)

#### Provided Program:
```python
import math

# Function 1 (not used in func_2):
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

# Function 2 (used in the main loop):
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
    if cnt == 0:
        return 1
    return cnt
```

#### Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- `func_1` correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
- `func_2` is supposed to count valid pairs but uses a different logic that does not align with the problem description.

#### Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - Correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers.
   - Not used in `func_2`, which is a red flag since the GCD is crucial for the problem.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - Initializes `cnt` to 0.
   - Iterates over \( i \) from 1 to \( m-1 \).
   - For each \( i \), calculates \( x = n - (i * i - i) \) and \( y = i * i \).
   - Updates `cnt` by adding \( x // y + (i > 1) \).
   - If `cnt` is 0, returns 1; otherwise, returns `cnt`.

#### Issues:
1. **Logic Mismatch**:
   - The provided logic does not check the condition \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).
   - The loop only iterates over \( i \) from 1 to \( m-1 \) and does not consider all pairs \((a, b)\).

2. **Missing GCD Calculation**:
   - The program does not use the GCD calculation, which is essential for the problem.

3. **Incorrect Loop Range**:
   - The loop should consider all pairs \((a, b)\) where \( 1 \le a \le n \) and \( 1 \le b \le m \).

4. **Incorrect Pair Counting**:
   - The way pairs are counted does not match the problem's requirement.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. It fails to properly count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) according to the given conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \). It misses the GCD calculation and incorrectly counts the pairs, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.
