### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to ensure correctness.

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The game involves a tree with exactly two leaves.
   - The tree can be treated as an array.
   - There is one round (t=1) where a stone starts on a given node.
   - Players take turns moving the stone to an inactive neighbor.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.
   - We need to determine the winner if both play optimally.

2. **Key Points:**
   - The game can be analyzed by determining the shortest distance from the starting node to each of the two leaves.
   - If at least one of these distances is even, Ron wins because he can force a win with optimal play.
   - If both distances are odd, Hermione wins because Ron will always be the one to face an odd number of moves left, thus losing.

3. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - Constructs the adjacency list representation of the tree.
     - Identifies the two leaf nodes.
     - Computes the shortest distance from the starting node to each leaf using BFS.
     - Determines the winner based on the parity of these distances.
   - **Function `bfs`:**
     - Implements a standard BFS to find the shortest path from a start node to a target node.
     - Returns the distance if the target is reachable.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The BFS function correctly computes the shortest path between nodes.
   - The logic in `func_1` to determine the winner based on the parity of the distances is correct.
   - The implementation handles the constraints and guarantees provided in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the distances from the starting node to the two leaf nodes.

**Correctness: True**
