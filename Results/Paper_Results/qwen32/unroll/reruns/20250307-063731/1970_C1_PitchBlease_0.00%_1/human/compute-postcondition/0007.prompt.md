You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is an integer representing the starting node, target is an integer representing the target node, tree is a dictionary (or similar structure) where each key is a node and its value is a list of its neighbors, queue is a deque (double-ended queue) initialized with a tuple (start, 0) representing the current node and its distance from the start, visited is a set initialized with the start node to keep track of visited nodes.
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: The output state depends on whether the target node is reachable from the start node:
    #- If the target node is reachable, the function returns the shortest distance from the start node to the target node.
    #- If the target node is not reachable, the function will exhaust the queue without finding the target, and the loop will terminate without returning a value. However, since the problem specifies the loop will finish and we need to describe the state, we can infer that the target is reachable, and the function would have returned a distance.
    #
    #Since the problem asks for the output state after the loop has finished and we assume the target is reachable, the output state would be the shortest distance from `start` to `target`.
    #
    #Output State:
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `bfs` accepts parameters `start` and `target`, where `start` is an integer representing the starting node and `target` is an integer representing the target node. It performs a breadth-first search on a tree structure represented by a dictionary `tree`, where each key is a node and its value is a list of its neighbors. The function uses a queue initialized with a tuple containing the `start` node and its distance from itself (0), and a set `visited` to keep track of visited nodes. The function returns -1.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns -1


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
