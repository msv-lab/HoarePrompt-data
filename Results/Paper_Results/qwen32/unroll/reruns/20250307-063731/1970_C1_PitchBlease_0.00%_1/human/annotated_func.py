#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, edges is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the edges of the tree, and start is an integer representing the starting node where 1 <= start <= n.
def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `tree` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where each key is a node (from 1 to n) and its value is a list of adjacent nodes, representing the adjacency list of the tree. The `n`, `edges`, and `start` variables remain unchanged.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 0 or dist2 % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns 'Ron'
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns 'Hermione'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` determines the winner between 'Ron' and 'Hermione' based on the distances from a starting node to two leaf nodes in a tree. It accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of nodes in the tree), `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree), and `start` (the starting node). The function returns 'Ron' if at least one of the distances from the starting node to the two leaf nodes is even, otherwise it returns 'Hermione'.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is an integer representing the starting node, target is an integer representing the target node, tree is a dictionary (or similar structure) where each key is a node and its value is a list of its neighbors, queue is a deque (double-ended queue) initialized with a tuple (start, 0) representing the current node and its distance from the start, visited is a set initialized with the start node to keep track of visited nodes.
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: The output state depends on whether the target node is reachable from the start node:
    #- If the target node is reachable, the function returns the shortest distance from the start node to the target node.
    #- If the target node is not reachable, the function will exhaust the queue without finding the target, and the loop will terminate without returning a value. However, since the problem specifies the loop will finish and we need to describe the state, we can infer that the target is reachable, and the function would have returned a distance.
    #
    #Since the problem asks for the output state after the loop has finished and we assume the target is reachable, the output state would be the shortest distance from `start` to `target`.
    #
    #Output State:
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `bfs` performs a breadth-first search to find the shortest distance from a starting node to a target node in a tree structure. It returns the shortest distance if the target is reachable, otherwise, it returns -1.
