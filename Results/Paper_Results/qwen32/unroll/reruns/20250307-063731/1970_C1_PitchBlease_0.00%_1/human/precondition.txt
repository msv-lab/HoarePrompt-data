n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, edges is a list of n-1 tuples, where each tuple contains two integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing an edge of the tree, and start is an integer (1 ≤ start ≤ n) representing the starting node of the game. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.
