Functionality: **The function `bfs` accepts parameters `start` and `target`, where `start` is an integer representing the starting node and `target` is an integer representing the target node. It performs a breadth-first search on a tree structure represented by a dictionary `tree`, where each key is a node and its value is a list of its neighbors. The function uses a queue initialized with a tuple containing the `start` node and its distance from itself (0), and a set `visited` to keep track of visited nodes. The function returns -1.**
