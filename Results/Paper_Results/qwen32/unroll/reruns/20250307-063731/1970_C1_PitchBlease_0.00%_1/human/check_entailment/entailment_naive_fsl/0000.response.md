Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided code has a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Global Variable Issue**:
   - The `bfs` function uses a global variable `tree`, which is not defined within the scope of `bfs`. This will lead to a `NameError` when `bfs` is called because `tree` is not accessible inside `bfs`.

2. **Incorrect BFS Logic**:
   - The BFS function is supposed to find the shortest distance from the `start` node to the `target` node. However, the BFS function does not correctly handle the scenario where the `target` node is not reachable from the `start` node. According to the problem, the tree is guaranteed to be connected, so this might not be an issue, but the code should still handle it gracefully.

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the distance from the `start` node to both leaves and checks if either distance is even. If either distance is even, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins. This logic seems correct based on the problem description, but the implementation has the issue mentioned above.

### Corrected Code Example:

To fix the global variable issue, we can pass the `tree` as an argument to the `bfs` function. Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        tree[v].append(u)
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]

    dist1 = bfs(tree, start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(tree, start, leaves[1])
    if dist1 % 2 == 0 or dist2 % 2 == 0:
        return 'Ron'
    else:
        return 'Hermione'

def bfs(tree, start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        (current, dist) = queue.popleft()
        if current == target:
            return dist
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
    return -1
```

### Conclusion:

The original code is incorrect due to the use of a global variable in the `bfs` function. The corrected version of the code should work as expected for all valid inputs according to the problem description.
