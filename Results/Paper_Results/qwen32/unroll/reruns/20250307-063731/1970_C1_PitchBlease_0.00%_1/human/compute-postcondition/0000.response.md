The provided code snippet reassigns the `queue` variable to a new `deque` containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`. This means the previous contents of `queue` are discarded, and it is now initialized with the starting node and its distance from itself, which is 0.

The `start` variable, `target` variable, `tree` dictionary, and `visited` set remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing the target node, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its value is a list of its neighbors, `queue` is a deque initialized with a tuple `(start, 0)`, `visited` is a set initialized with the start node.**
