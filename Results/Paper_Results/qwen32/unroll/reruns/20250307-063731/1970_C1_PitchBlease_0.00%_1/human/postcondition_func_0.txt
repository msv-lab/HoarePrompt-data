The function `func_1` determines the winner between 'Ron' and 'Hermione' based on the distances from a starting node to two leaf nodes in a tree. It accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of nodes in the tree), `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree), and `start` (the starting node). The function returns 'Ron' if at least one of the distances from the starting node to the two leaf nodes is even, otherwise it returns 'Hermione'.
