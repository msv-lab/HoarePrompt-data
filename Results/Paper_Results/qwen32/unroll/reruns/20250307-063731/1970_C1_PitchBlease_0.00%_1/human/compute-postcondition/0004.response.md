To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand the purpose of the code. This code is performing a Breadth-First Search (BFS) on a tree (represented as a graph) starting from a node `start` to find the shortest path to a `target` node. The BFS algorithm uses a queue to explore nodes level by level, keeping track of the distance from the start node.

Given the initial state:
- `start` is an integer representing the starting node.
- `target` is an integer representing the target node.
- `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its value is a list of its neighbors.
- `queue` is a deque initialized with a tuple `(start, 0)`, representing the starting node and its distance from itself (0).
- `visited` is a set containing the start node.

The loop continues until the `queue` is empty. In each iteration, it:
1. Dequeues the first element, which is a tuple containing the current node and its distance from the start node.
2. Checks if the current node is the target node. If so, it returns the distance.
3. Otherwise, it iterates over all neighbors of the current node. If a neighbor has not been visited, it adds the neighbor to the `visited` set and enqueues it with an incremented distance.

The loop terminates when the queue is empty, meaning all reachable nodes have been explored.

**Output State:**
The output state depends on whether the target node is reachable from the start node:
- If the target node is reachable, the function returns the shortest distance from the start node to the target node.
- If the target node is not reachable, the function will exhaust the queue without finding the target, and the loop will terminate without returning a value. However, since the problem specifies the loop will finish and we need to describe the state, we can infer that the target is reachable, and the function would have returned a distance.

Since the problem asks for the output state after the loop has finished and we assume the target is reachable, the output state would be the shortest distance from `start` to `target`.

Output State: **the shortest distance from `start` to `target`.**

In natural language: The output state is the shortest distance from the starting node to the target node, as determined by the BFS algorithm.
