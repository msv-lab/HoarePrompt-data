In the given program, the `while` loop condition is `while queue:`. This means the loop will execute as long as the `queue` is not empty. The state right before the loop indicates that `queue` is initialized with a tuple `(start, 0)`. Since `queue` is initialized with a tuple, it is not empty, and the loop can certainly execute one time.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute the first time. We simply repeat the program state right before the loop.

State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing the target node, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node and its value is a list of its neighbors, `queue` is a deque initialized with a tuple `(start, 0)`, `visited` is a set containing the start node.**
