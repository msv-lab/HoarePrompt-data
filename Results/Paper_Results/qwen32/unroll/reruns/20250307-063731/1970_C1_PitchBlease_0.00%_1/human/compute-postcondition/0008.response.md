Postcondition: **`tree` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where each key is a node (from 1 to n) and its value is a list of adjacent nodes, representing the adjacency list of the tree; `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged; `leaves` is a list of nodes from `tree` that have exactly one adjacent node; `dist1` is the shortest path distance from `start` to `leaves[0]`; `dist2` is the shortest path distance from `start` to `leaves[1]`. Both `dist1` and `dist2` are odd numbers.**
