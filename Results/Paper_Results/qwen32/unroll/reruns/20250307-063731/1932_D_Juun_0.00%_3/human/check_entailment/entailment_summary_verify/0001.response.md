Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summary to verify if the program correctly solves the problem as described.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of rounds (`n`), the trump suit, and the list of 2n cards in the discard pile.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `trumps`: A list to store ranks of trump cards.
   - `answers`: A list to store pairs of cards that form valid rounds.
   - `suits`: A dictionary to temporarily store the card of each non-trump suit that has been played but not yet beaten.

3. **Processing Each Card**:
   - For each card in the discard pile, the program checks the suit:
     - If the suit is the trump suit, the card's rank is added to the `trumps` list.
     - If the suit is not the trump suit and there is already a card stored for that suit in the `suits` dictionary, the program adds a pair of cards (the stored card and the current card) to the `answers` list, sorts them by rank, and resets the entry for that suit in the `suits` dictionary.
     - If the suit is not the trump suit and there is no card stored for that suit, the current card's rank is stored in the `suits` dictionary for that suit.

4. **Handling Remaining Cards in `suits`**:
   - After processing all cards, the program checks if there are any remaining cards in the `suits` dictionary.
   - If there is a remaining card for a suit and there are trump cards available, the program pairs the remaining card with the highest available trump card, adds the pair to the `answers` list, and removes the trump card from the `trumps` list.
   - If there is a remaining card for a suit and no trump cards are available, the program prints "IMPOSSIBLE" and exits the function.

5. **Handling Remaining Trump Cards**:
   - After processing the remaining cards in the `suits` dictionary, the program sorts the `trumps` list and pairs the highest available trump card with the next highest available trump card, printing each pair.

6. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints all pairs stored in the `answers` list.

### Correctness Check

- **Pairing Non-Trump Cards**:
  - The logic of pairing non-trump cards of the same suit is correct. If two cards of the same non-trump suit are encountered, they are paired and sorted by rank.

- **Using Trump Cards**:
  - The logic of using trump cards to beat non-trump cards is correct. If there is a remaining non-trump card, it is paired with the highest available trump card.

- **Handling Insufficient Trump Cards**:
  - The program correctly handles the case where there are insufficient trump cards to pair all remaining non-trump cards by printing "IMPOSSIBLE".

- **Sorting Trump Cards**:
  - The program sorts the `trumps` list before pairing them, ensuring that the highest available trump card is used first.

### Edge Cases

- **Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case.
- **Single Card Pairs**: The program correctly handles cases where the number of rounds is 1.
- **All Trump Cards**: The program correctly handles cases where all cards are trump cards by pairing them in descending order of rank.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem based on the given problem description and example inputs/outputs. It handles all specified cases and edge cases appropriately.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**
