The code snippet `trumps = sorted(trumps)` sorts the `trumps` list. Given that the initial state specifies `trumps` as an empty list, sorting an empty list remains an empty list. Therefore, the value of `trumps` does not change.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; `trumps` is an empty list; `answers` is a list of sorted pairs of non-trump cards of the same suit with additional pairs of non-trump and trump cards; `suits` is a dictionary where each key's value is either None or the rank of an unpaired non-trump card of that suit and is unchanged.**
