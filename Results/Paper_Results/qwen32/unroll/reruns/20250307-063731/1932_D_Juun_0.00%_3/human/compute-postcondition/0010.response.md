To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the state so that the condition `trumps != []` is satisfied. This means the `trumps` list must contain at least one element.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16
- `trumps` is an empty list
- `answers` is a list of sorted pairs of non-trump cards of the same suit with additional pairs of non-trump and trump cards
- `suits` is a dictionary where each key's value is either None or the rank of an unpaired non-trump card of that suit and is unchanged

The only variable in the loop head is `trumps`. To make the loop execute, we need to modify `trumps` so that it is not an empty list.

Therefore, we need to add at least one element to the `trumps` list.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; `trumps` is a list containing at least one element; `answers` is a list of sorted pairs of non-trump cards of the same suit with additional pairs of non-trump and trump cards; `suits` is a dictionary where each key's value is either None or the rank of an unpaired non-trump card of that suit and is unchanged**
