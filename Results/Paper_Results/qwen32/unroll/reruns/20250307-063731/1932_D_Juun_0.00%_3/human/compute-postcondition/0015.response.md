Functionality: **The function processes a set of cards for a given number of test cases, identifies pairs of cards, and prints them according to specific rules involving a designated trump suit. For each test case, it pairs non-trump cards of the same suit, then pairs any remaining unpaired non-trump cards with the highest available trump cards. If there are insufficient trumps to pair all unpaired non-trump cards, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE". The function does not return a value but prints the pairs of cards.**
