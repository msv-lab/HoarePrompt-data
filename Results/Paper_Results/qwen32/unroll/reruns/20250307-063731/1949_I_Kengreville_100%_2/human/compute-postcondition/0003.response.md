The code snippet `r = [None] * n` reassigns the variable `r` to be a new list of length `n` where each element is `None`. This means the previous values in `r` are overwritten.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\); `x` is a list of length `n` with each element being `None`; `y` is a list of length `n` with each element being `None`; `r` is a list of length `n` with each element being `None`; `visited` is a list of length `n` initialized with `False`; `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized with `None`.**
