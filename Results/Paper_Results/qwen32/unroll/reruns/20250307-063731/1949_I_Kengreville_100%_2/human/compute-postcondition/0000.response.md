The code snippet provided is:

```python
n = int(input())
```

This line of code reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. Given the initial state, `n` was already an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\). The execution of this line will replace the previous value of `n` with the new integer input provided by the user. The other variables (`x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\); `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers where each `x[i]`, `y[i]` satisfies \(-10^9 \leq x[i], y[i] \leq 10^9\) and each `r[i]` satisfies \(1 \leq r[i] \leq 10^9\); `visited` and `coef` are lists of length `n` initialized with `False` and `None` respectively.**
