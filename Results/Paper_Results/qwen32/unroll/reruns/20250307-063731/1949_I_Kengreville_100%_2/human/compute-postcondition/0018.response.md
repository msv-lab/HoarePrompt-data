Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. It processes a predefined set of lists: `x`, `y`, and `r`, each containing integers within specified ranges, and two additional lists `visited` and `coef` of length `n` initialized with `False` and `None` respectively. The function returns a value based on the processing of these lists, but the specific return value is not detailed in the provided constraints.**
