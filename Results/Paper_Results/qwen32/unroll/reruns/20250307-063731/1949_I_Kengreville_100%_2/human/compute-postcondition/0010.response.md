The code snippet provided only initializes the variable `ok` to `False`. None of the other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\); `x` is a list of length `n` with each element being an integer input by the user; `y` is a list of length `n` with each element being an integer input by the user; `r` is a list of length `n` with each element being an integer input by the user; `visited` is a list of length `n` initialized with `False`; `coef` is a list of length `n` with each element being `None`; `tot` is 0; `bipartite` is `True`; `ok` is `False`.**
