Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\); `x` is a list of length `n` with each element being an integer input by the user; `y` is a list of length `n` with each element being an integer input by the user; `r` is a list of length `n` with each element being an integer input by the user; `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements being `True`; `coef` is a list of length `n` with each element being `1` for indices that were initially unvisited; `tot` and `bipartite` will have values determined by the `dfs` function; `ok` is `True` indicating that at least one connected component is bipartite and has a non-zero `tot`.**
