Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\); `x` is a list of length `n` with each element being `None`; `y` is a list of length `n` with each element being `None`; `r` is a list of length `n` with each element being `None`; `visited` is a list of length `n` initialized with `False`; `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized with `None`.**

Explanation: The variable `visited` is re-initialized to a list of length `n` with each element being `False`. All other variables remain unchanged.
