The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and three lists `x`, `y`, and `r` of length `n` containing integers. It then determines if there is at least one connected component in a graph defined by these lists that is bipartite and has a non-zero total sum of some computed values (`tot`). If such a component exists, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
