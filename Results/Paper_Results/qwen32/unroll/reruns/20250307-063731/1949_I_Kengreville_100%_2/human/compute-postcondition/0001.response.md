The code snippet `x = [None] * n` reassigns the variable `x` to be a new list of length `n` where each element is `None`. The previous values of `x`, `y`, and `r` are no longer relevant to `x` after this assignment. The values of `y` and `r` remain unchanged, as does the value of `n`. The lists `visited` and `coef` also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\); `x` is a list of length `n` with each element being `None`; `y` is a list of integers where each `y[i]` satisfies \(-10^9 \leq y[i] \leq 10^9\); `r` is a list of integers where each `r[i]` satisfies \(1 \leq r[i] \leq 10^9\); `visited` is a list of length `n` initialized with `False`; `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized with `None`.**
