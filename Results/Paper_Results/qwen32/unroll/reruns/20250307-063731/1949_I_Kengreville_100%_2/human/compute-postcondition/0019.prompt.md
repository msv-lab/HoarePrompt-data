You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, x, y, and r are lists of integers where each x[i], y[i] satisfies -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 and each r[i] satisfies 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9. visited and coef are lists of length n initialized with False and None respectively.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef = [None] * n
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\); `x` is a list of length `n` with each element being an integer input by the user; `y` is a list of length `n` with each element being an integer input by the user; `r` is a list of length `n` with each element being an integer input by the user; `visited` is a list of length `n` initialized with `False`; `coef` is a list of length `n` with each element being `None`.
    tot = 0
    bipartite = True
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef[i] = 1
            tot = 0
            bipartite = True
            dfs(i)
            ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0
        
    #State: `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\); `x` is a list of length `n` with each element being an integer input by the user; `y` is a list of length `n` with each element being an integer input by the user; `r` is a list of length `n` with each element being an integer input by the user; `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements being `True`; `coef` is a list of length `n` with each element being `1` for indices that were initially unvisited; `tot` and `bipartite` will have values determined by the `dfs` function; `ok` will be `True` if at least one connected component is bipartite and has a non-zero `tot`.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\); `x` is a list of length `n` with each element being an integer input by the user; `y` is a list of length `n` with each element being an integer input by the user; `r` is a list of length `n` with each element being an integer input by the user; `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements being `True`; `coef` is a list of length `n` with each element being `1` for indices that were initially unvisited; `tot` and `bipartite` have values determined by the `dfs` function; `ok` is `True` if at least one connected component is bipartite and has a non-zero `tot`, otherwise `ok` is `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. It processes a predefined set of lists: `x`, `y`, and `r`, each containing integers within specified ranges, and two additional lists `visited` and `coef` of length `n` initialized with `False` and `None` respectively. The function returns a value based on the processing of these lists, but the specific return value is not detailed in the provided constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
