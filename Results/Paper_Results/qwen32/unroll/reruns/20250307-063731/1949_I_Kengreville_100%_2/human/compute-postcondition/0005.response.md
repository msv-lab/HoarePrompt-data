The code snippet provided is `coef = [None] * n`. This line of code reassigns the list `coef` to a new list of length `n`, where each element is `None`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, as they remain unchanged. The only change is in the `coef` list, which is now a new list of length `n` with all elements set to `None`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\); `x` is a list of length `n` with each element being `None`; `y` is a list of length `n` with each element being `None`; `r` is a list of length `n` with each element being `None`; `visited` is a list of length `n` initialized with `False`; `coef` is a list of length `n` with each element being `None`.**
