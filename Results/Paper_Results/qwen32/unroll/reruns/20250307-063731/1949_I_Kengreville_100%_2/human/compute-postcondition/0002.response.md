The code snippet `y = [None] * n` changes the list `y` to a new list of length `n` where each element is `None`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\); `x` is a list of length `n` with each element being `None`; `y` is a list of length `n` with each element being `None`; `r` is a list of integers where each `r[i]` satisfies \(1 \leq r[i] \leq 10^9\); `visited` is a list of length `n` initialized with `False`; `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized with `None`.**
