The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `numbers`. No other variables are affected by this code. The initial conditions about `n`, `t`, the tree structure, and the starting node for the round remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t=1, the tree has exactly n nodes and n-1 edges, the tree has exactly two leaves, and the next line contains t integers 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, each representing the starting node for a round; `numbers` is an empty list.**
