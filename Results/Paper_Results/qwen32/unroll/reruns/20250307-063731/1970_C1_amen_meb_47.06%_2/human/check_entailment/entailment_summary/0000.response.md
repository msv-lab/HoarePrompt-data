Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner of the game. The `func_1` function reads the edges of the tree, but it does not process the initial position of the stone or the game rules. The main part of the program seems to be counting something related to `Ron_co` and `Hib_co`, but it does not use the tree structure or the initial stone position to determine the winner.

The problem requires analyzing the tree structure to determine the winner based on the starting node. The game is played on a linear structure (array-like tree with exactly two leaves), and the winner depends on whether the starting node is closer to one of the leaves or if it is in the middle.

The provided program does not perform any of these checks and instead seems to be counting something unrelated to the game's rules. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
