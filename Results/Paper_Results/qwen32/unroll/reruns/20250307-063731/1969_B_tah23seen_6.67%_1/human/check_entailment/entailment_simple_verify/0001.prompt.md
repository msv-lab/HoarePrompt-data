You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
The task is to sort a binary string `s` in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's should come before all '1's) using the minimum cost. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being cyclically shifted.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it calls `func_1(sChar)` which is supposed to compute the minimum cost to sort the string `sChar`.

#### `func_1(sChar)`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `s` is converted from a string to a list of characters.
   - `left` and `right` pointers are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively.
   - `cost` is initialized to 0.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right` and both are within the bounds of the string.
   - If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', it swaps these characters and adds the cost `right - left + 1` to the total cost.
   - It then moves the `right` pointer to the next '0' and the `left` pointer to the next '1'.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when either `left` surpasses `right` or either pointer goes out of bounds.
   - The function returns the accumulated `cost`.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Logic Flaw**:
   - The program attempts to swap '0's and '1's directly, but it doesn't correctly handle the cost associated with cyclic shifts.
   - The cost calculation `right - left + 1` is not always accurate as it assumes a direct swap, not a cyclic shift of a substring.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program may not handle cases where multiple '0's are adjacent to multiple '1's correctly.
   - It might miss optimal cyclic shifts that could reduce the total cost.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - The program could be inefficient for large strings, especially with multiple '0's and '1's.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
