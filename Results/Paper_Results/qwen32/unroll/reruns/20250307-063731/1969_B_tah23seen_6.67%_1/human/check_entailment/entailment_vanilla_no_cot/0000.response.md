Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using the described cyclic shift operations. The logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not account for all possible optimal cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.

Here are some key issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation is not correctly implemented. The cost should be the sum of the lengths of all substrings that are cyclically shifted, but the current implementation only calculates the cost for swaps between '0' and '1' without considering the optimal way to perform these swaps.

2. **Inefficient Sorting Logic**: The program attempts to swap '0's and '1's directly, but it does not guarantee the minimal cost to achieve a sorted string. There are cases where multiple swaps and shifts are needed, and the current approach does not handle these efficiently.

3. **Handling of Substrings**: The program does not handle the cyclic shifts of substrings correctly. It only checks for direct swaps between '0' and '1', which is not sufficient to sort the entire string optimally.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases, such as strings with all '0's or all '1's, correctly. It should return a cost of 0 in these cases, but the current implementation might not handle this properly.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to determine the minimum cost of sorting the string through cyclic shifts.
