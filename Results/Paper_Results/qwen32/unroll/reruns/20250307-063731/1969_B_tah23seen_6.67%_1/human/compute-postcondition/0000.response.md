The code snippet provided is `s = []`, which initializes an empty list named `s`. This action does not affect the variable `sChar` in any way, as it is a separate variable. Therefore, the initial state of `sChar` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings, where each string `s` consists of only the characters '0' and '1', and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(`s`) <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, the total sum of the lengths of all strings in `sChar` does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `s` is an empty list.**
