Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
The task is to sort a binary string `s` in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's should come before all '1's) using the minimum cost. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being cyclically shifted.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it calls `func_1(sChar)` which is supposed to compute the minimum cost to sort the string `sChar`.

#### `func_1(sChar)`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `s` is converted from a string to a list of characters.
   - `left` and `right` pointers are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively.
   - `cost` is initialized to 0.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right` and both are within the bounds of the string.
   - If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', it swaps these characters and adds the cost `right - left + 1` to the total cost.
   - It then moves the `right` pointer to the next '0' and the `left` pointer to the next '1'.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when either `left` surpasses `right` or either pointer goes out of bounds.
   - The function returns the accumulated `cost`.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Logic Flaw**:
   - The program attempts to swap '0's and '1's directly, but it doesn't correctly handle the cost associated with cyclic shifts.
   - The cost calculation `right - left + 1` is not always accurate as it assumes a direct swap, not a cyclic shift of a substring.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program may not handle cases where multiple '0's are adjacent to multiple '1's correctly.
   - It might miss optimal cyclic shifts that could reduce the total cost.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - The program could be inefficient for large strings, especially with multiple '0's and '1's.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
