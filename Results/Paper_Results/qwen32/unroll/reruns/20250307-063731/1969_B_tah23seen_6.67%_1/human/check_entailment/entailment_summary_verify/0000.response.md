### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to sort a binary string in non-descending order (all '0's to the left of all '1's) using the minimum cost. The cost of a cyclic shift operation on a substring is the length of that substring. The operations can be performed any number of times.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code defines a function `func_1` that attempts to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string by swapping '0's and '1's. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `left` and `right` pointers are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively.
   - `cost` is initialized to 0.

2. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `left <= right` and both `right` and `left` are within the bounds of the string.
   - If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', the code swaps these characters and adds the cost `(right - left + 1)` to the total cost.
   - The `right` pointer is incremented until it points to a '0' or reaches the end of the string.
   - The `left` pointer is incremented until it points to a '1' or reaches the end of the string.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary suggests that the function calculates the cost of swapping '0's and '1's to group all '0's to the left of all '1's. However, the logic described in the summary does not match the actual implementation, which seems to be attempting a two-pointer approach to swap '0's and '1's directly.

#### Flaws in the Code:
- **Incorrect Cost Calculation:** The cost calculation `(right - left + 1)` does not reflect the actual cost of a cyclic shift operation. Cyclic shifting a substring `[l, r]` should have a cost of `(r - l + 1)`, but the implementation seems to be incorrectly counting the cost of direct swaps rather than considering the cyclic nature of the operation.
- **Inefficient Handling of Swaps:** The code does not correctly handle the cyclic nature of the operation. Swapping '0's and '1's directly does not necessarily minimize the cost of sorting the string using cyclic shifts.
- **Edge Cases:** The code does not handle edge cases correctly, such as strings with all '0's or all '1's, or strings that are already sorted.

#### Verification with Test Case:
Let's verify the code with the provided test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
11010
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
One optimal strategy is:
1. Choose substring `[2, 4]`: `11010` -> `10110` (cost: 3)

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
5
```

**Explanation of Actual Output:**
The program incorrectly calculates the cost as 5, likely due to incorrect swapping and cost calculation logic.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using the described cyclic shift operations. The logic in the function `func_1` is flawed and does not handle all edge cases correctly. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
