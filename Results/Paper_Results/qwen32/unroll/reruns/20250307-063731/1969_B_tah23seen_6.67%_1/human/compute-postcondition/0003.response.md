The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `left`. The list `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is `s` is a list that contains all the strings from `sChar` in the same order, and `left` is `0`.

Output State: **`s` is a list that contains all the strings from `sChar` in the same order; `left` is `0`**.
