You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            (s[right], s[left]) = (s[left], s[right])
            cost += right - left + 1
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
    return cost



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a parameter `sChar`, which is a list of strings where each string consists only of the characters '0' and '1'. It calculates and returns the cost of swapping '0's and '1's to group all '0's to the left of all '1's in the concatenated string formed by `sChar`. The cost is determined by the number of swaps needed, where each swap involves moving a '0' to the left of a '1' and the cost is incremented by the distance between the positions of the '0' and '1' plus one. The function returns the total cost of these swaps.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using the described cyclic shift operations. The logic in the function `func_1` is flawed and does not handle all edge cases correctly.

Here is an example where the program does not work as expected:

**Test Case:**
```
1
11010
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
To sort the string `11010` into `00111`, one optimal strategy is:
1. Choose substring `[2, 4]`: `11010` -> `10110` (cost: 3)

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
5
```

**Explanation of Actual Output:**
The program incorrectly calculates the cost as 5, likely due to incorrect swapping and cost calculation logic.

The program fails to correctly handle the cost calculation and the cyclic shifts required to sort the string. Specifically, the program's logic for swapping and cost calculation is flawed and does not ensure the minimum cost for sorting the string.

Thus, the program is incorrect and the Correctness is **False**.
