To ensure that the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to verify the conditions in the loop head:

The `while` loop condition is:
```
left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s))
```

Let's analyze each part of the condition:

1. **`left <= right`**: 
   - Given that `left` is `0` and `right` is `1`, this condition is already satisfied (`0 <= 1`).

2. **`right < len(s)`**:
   - `right` is `1`, so `len(s)` must be greater than `1` for this condition to be true.

3. **`(left < len(s))`**:
   - `left` is `0`, so `len(s)` must be greater than `0` for this condition to be true.

Since `len(s)` must be greater than `1` to satisfy both `right < len(s)` and `left < len(s)`, we need to adjust the state of `s` to ensure it has at least two elements.

Therefore, the modified state should be:

State: **`s` is a list that contains at least two strings from `sChar` in the same order; `left` is `0`; `cost` is `0`; `right` is `1`**
