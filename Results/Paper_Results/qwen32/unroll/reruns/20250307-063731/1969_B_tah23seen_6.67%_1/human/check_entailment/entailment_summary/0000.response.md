Reasoning:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the binary string and swapping '0's and '1's to sort the string in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's to the left of all '1's). The cost of each swap is the length of the substring involved in the swap, which is calculated as `right - left + 1`. 

However, there are several issues with the current implementation:

1. The code does not correctly handle the cyclic nature of the swap operation. The problem specifies that a cyclic shift of a substring can be performed, which means that the last character of the substring can be moved to the front, and all other characters can be shifted right. The current implementation does not account for this and simply swaps the characters at the `left` and `right` indices.

2. The logic for incrementing `left` and `right` indices is flawed. The `left` index should be incremented until a '1' is found, and the `right` index should be incremented until a '0' is found. However, the code does not correctly handle the case when `left` and `right` indices cross each other, and it does not reset the `right` index after a swap.

3. The code does not handle the case when there are multiple '0's and '1's in the string. It assumes that there is only one '0' and one '1' to swap at a time, which is incorrect.

4. The code assumes that the input `sChar` is a list of strings, but the problem description specifies that `sChar` is a single binary string. The conversion of `sChar` to a list of characters is unnecessary and potentially incorrect if the input is not as expected.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
