### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to compute the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on its substrings. However, the provided `func_1` function does not correctly implement the logic to achieve this.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Initialization and Logic**:
   - The function initializes `left` to 0 and `right` to 1. It then iterates through the string with the intention of swapping '1's to the right of '0's to sort the string.
   - However, the swapping logic is incorrect. The function swaps elements when `s[right] == '0'` and `s[left] == '1'`, and then increments the cost by `right - left + 1`. This logic does not guarantee the minimum cost to sort the string.

2. **Swapping and Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation `cost += right - left + 1` is based on the length of the substring being cyclically shifted. However, the function does not correctly identify the minimal substrings that need to be shifted to achieve the sorted order.
   - The function uses two nested loops to find the next '0' and '1' respectively, but this approach does not ensure that the minimal cost is achieved.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle cases where the string is already sorted or where there are multiple consecutive '0's or '1's correctly.
   - For example, in the case of the string "01101001", the function might not perform the minimal number of swaps to achieve the sorted string "00001111" with the minimum cost.

4. **Output State**:
   - The output state described in the comments suggests that the function returns the correct cost for a specific permutation of the string, but this is not a general solution.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the logic and the handling of edge cases, the provided function `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum total cost to sort the binary string in all cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Correctness: **False**
