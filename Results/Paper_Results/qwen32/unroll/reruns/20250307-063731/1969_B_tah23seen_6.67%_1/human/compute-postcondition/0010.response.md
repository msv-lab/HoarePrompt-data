Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `sChar`, which is a list of strings where each string consists only of the characters '0' and '1'. It calculates and returns the cost of swapping '0's and '1's to group all '0's to the left of all '1's in the concatenated string formed by `sChar`. The cost is determined by the number of swaps needed, where each swap involves moving a '0' to the left of a '1' and the cost is incremented by the distance between the positions of the '0' and '1' plus one. The function returns the total cost of these swaps.**
