### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted. The goal is to determine the minimum total cost to sort the string.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to sort the binary string by swapping '0's and '1's and calculating the cost of these swaps. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the code logic:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `left` is initialized to 0.
   - `right` is initialized to 1.
   - `cost` is initialized to 0.

2. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `left <= right` and `right < len(s)` and `left < len(s)`.
   - If `s[right] == '0'` and `s[left] == '1'`, it swaps these two elements and adds `right - left + 1` to the cost.
   - After the swap, it increments `right` until it finds a '0' or reaches the end of the string.
   - It then increments `left` until it finds a '1' or reaches the end of the string.

3. **Termination:**
   - The loop terminates when `right` reaches the end of the string or `left` surpasses `right`.

#### Annotations:
The annotations state that the final state of the list `s` is a sorted list of '0's followed by '1's, and the cost is calculated correctly for a specific example. However, the annotations do not provide a general proof or verification for all possible inputs.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect by providing a specific test case where the program's output does not match the expected output. The provided test case is:

**Test Case:**
```
1
11010
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
5
```

Let's verify this test case manually:

- Initial string: `11010`
- Steps to sort:
  1. Choose substring `[2, 4]` (`11010` -> `10110`): Cost = 3
- Sorted string: `00111`
- Total cost: 3

The program's output of 5 seems incorrect for this test case.

#### General Analysis:
The logic in `func_1` involves swapping '0's and '1's and calculating the cost. However, the approach does not guarantee the minimum cost for all cases. The provided test case demonstrates that the program does not always produce the correct minimum cost.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and the provided test case, the original assessment appears to be correct. The program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the described cyclic shift operations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
