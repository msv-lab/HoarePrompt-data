### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem of sorting a binary string in non-descending order using the minimum cost of cyclic shifts. However, there are a few issues with the approach taken in the `func_1` function.

1. **Initialization of `left` and `right`**: The `left` pointer is initialized to 0 and `right` to 1. The intention seems to be to find the first '1' from the left and the first '0' from the right, but the logic is flawed. The `right` pointer should start from the next position of `left` after each swap, not from 1 for each iteration.

2. **Swapping Logic**: The swapping logic is incorrect. The program attempts to swap '0's and '1's directly, but the cost calculation does not reflect the actual cost of cyclic shifts. The cost should be based on the length of the substring being shifted, not just the distance between the '0' and '1'.

3. **Pointer Movement**: After a swap, the `left` and `right` pointers are not correctly updated to continue the process. The `left` pointer should move to the next '1', and the `right` pointer should move to the next '0'.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if the string is already sorted, the cost should be 0. The current implementation may not correctly handle such cases.

5. **Loop Conditions**: The loop conditions are not correctly defined to handle all cases, especially when the string has multiple '0's or '1's in a row.

### Correctness:

Given the issues mentioned above, the provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
