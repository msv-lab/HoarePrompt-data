Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using the described cyclic shift operations. The logic in the function `func_1` is flawed and does not handle all edge cases correctly.

Here is an example where the program does not work as expected:

**Test Case:**
```
1
11010
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
To sort the string `11010` into `00111`, one optimal strategy is:
1. Choose substring `[2, 4]`: `11010` -> `10110` (cost: 3)

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
5
```

**Explanation of Actual Output:**
The program incorrectly calculates the cost as 5, likely due to incorrect swapping and cost calculation logic.

The program fails to correctly handle the cost calculation and the cyclic shifts required to sort the string. Specifically, the program's logic for swapping and cost calculation is flawed and does not ensure the minimum cost for sorting the string.

Thus, the program is incorrect and the Correctness is **False**.
