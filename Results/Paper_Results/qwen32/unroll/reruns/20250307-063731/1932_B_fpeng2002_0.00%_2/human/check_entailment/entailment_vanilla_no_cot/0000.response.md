Correctness: **False**

The current implementation of the function `func` has a logical error in the line where it calculates the `start_year`. Specifically, the expression `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is incorrect for finding the next occurrence of the sign after `start_year`. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in nums:
            # Find the next occurrence of the sign after start_year
            start_year = ((start_year - 1) // x + 1) * x
        print(start_year)
```

In the corrected version, the line `start_year = ((start_year - 1) // x + 1) * x` correctly computes the next occurrence of the sign after `start_year`. This ensures that the tribe starts waiting for the next sign strictly after the current sign has occurred.
