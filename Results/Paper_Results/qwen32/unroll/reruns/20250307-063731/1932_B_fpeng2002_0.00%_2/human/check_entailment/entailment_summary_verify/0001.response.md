Let's carefully analyze the provided program code and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. The signs must occur sequentially, where each subsequent sign can only occur after the previous one. The i-th sign occurs every a_i years, starting from year a_i, 2 * a_i, 3 * a_i, etc.

### Program Analysis

The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case as follows:
1. It reads the number of signs `n`.
2. It reads the list of periodicities `nums`.
3. It initializes `start_year` to 0.
4. It iterates through each periodicity `nums[x]` and updates `start_year` to the next occurrence of the sign after `start_year`.

The key part of the logic is the calculation inside the loop:
```python
start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
```
Let's break down what this line does:
- `start_year + 1`: Moves to the next year from the current `start_year`.
- `(start_year + 1) // nums[x]`: Calculates how many full periods of `nums[x]` have passed since the start.
- `(start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1`: Moves to the next period.
- `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`: Calculates the year in which the next occurrence of the sign will happen.

### Verification with Example

Let's verify the program with the first example from the problem:

**Input:**
```
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
```

**Step-by-step Execution:**
1. `start_year = 0`
2. For the first sign (periodicity 3):
   - `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
3. For the second sign (periodicity 2):
   - `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
4. For the third sign (periodicity 4):
   - `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
5. For the fourth sign (periodicity 5):
   - `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
6. For the fifth sign (periodicity 9):
   - `start_year = ((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
7. For the sixth sign (periodicity 18):
   - `start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`

The output matches the expected result.

### Verification with Additional Examples

Let's verify the program with additional examples from the problem:

**Example 2:**
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Step-by-step Execution:**
1. `start_year = 0`
2. For the first sign (periodicity 1):
   - `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2` (incorrect, should be 1)
3. For the second sign (periodicity 2):
   - `start_year = ((1 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4` (incorrect, should be 2)
4. For the third sign (periodicity 3):
   - `start_year = ((2 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 6` (incorrect, should be 3)
5. For the fourth sign (periodicity 4):
   - `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8` (incorrect, should be 4)
6. For the fifth sign (periodicity 5):
   - `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10` (incorrect, should be 5)

The output does not match the expected result.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. Specifically, the calculation for `start_year` is incorrect because it always moves to the next period after `start_year + 1`, which is not the correct way to find the next occurrence of the sign after `start_year`.

### Correct Calculation

The correct way to find the next occurrence of the sign after `start_year` is:
```python
start_year = ((start_year // nums[x]) + 1) * nums[x]
```

### Final Assessment

The original assessment is **incorrect**.

Final: **False**
