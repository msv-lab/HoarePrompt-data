The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and a list of integers. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and it satisfies the condition 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, there is an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each integer `a_i` satisfies the condition 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It returns a result for each test case based on the provided integers.**
