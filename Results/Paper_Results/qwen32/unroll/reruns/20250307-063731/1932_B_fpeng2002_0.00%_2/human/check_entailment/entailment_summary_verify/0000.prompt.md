You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific `start_year` value based on the provided integers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- The Chaya tribe believes in `n` signs of the apocalypse, where each `i-th` sign occurs every `a_i` years.
- The signs must occur sequentially.
- If the `i-th` sign occurs in year `x`, the tribe waits for the `(i+1)-th` sign starting from year `x+1`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it:
1. Reads the number of signs `n`.
2. Reads the list of periodicities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
3. Initializes `start_year` to 0.
4. Iterates through each sign and calculates the next occurrence year based on the previous sign's occurrence year.

### Key Logic:
```python
start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
```
- This line calculates the next occurrence year for the current sign.
- `(start_year + 1) // nums[x]` finds the next multiple of `nums[x]` after `start_year`.
- Adding 1 ensures we are starting the search from the year after the last sign's occurrence.
- Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the correct year for the next sign.

### Correctness Verification:
Let's verify the logic with the provided examples and a few additional edge cases.

#### Example 1:
```
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
```
- Year 3: First sign.
- Year 4: Second sign.
- Year 8: Third sign.
- Year 10: Fourth sign.
- Year 18: Fifth sign.
- Year 36: Sixth sign.

#### Example 2:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
- Year 1: First sign.
- Year 2: Second sign.
- Year 3: Third sign.
- Year 4: Fourth sign.
- Year 5: Fifth sign.

#### Example 3:
```
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
- Year 1: First sign.
- Year 2: Second sign.
- Year 3: Third sign.
- Year 4: Fourth sign.
- Year 5: Fifth sign.

#### Example 4:
```
6
50 30 711 200 503 1006
```
- Year 50: First sign.
- Year 60: Second sign.
- Year 761: Third sign.
- Year 961: Fourth sign.
- Year 1464: Fifth sign.
- Year 2012: Sixth sign.

The program seems to correctly handle these examples. Let's consider a few edge cases:

#### Edge Case 1:
```
1
1000000
```
- Year 1000000: First sign.

#### Edge Case 2:
```
2
1 1000000
```
- Year 1: First sign.
- Year 1000001: Second sign.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly calculate the year in which the `n-th` sign will occur for all the given examples and edge cases. There doesn't seem to be any logical errors or edge cases that the program fails to handle.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The program correctly calculates the year for each sign's occurrence based on the previous sign's occurrence year, ensuring that the signs occur sequentially as per the problem description. The logic handles various scenarios, including large periodicities and multiple test cases, without any issues.
