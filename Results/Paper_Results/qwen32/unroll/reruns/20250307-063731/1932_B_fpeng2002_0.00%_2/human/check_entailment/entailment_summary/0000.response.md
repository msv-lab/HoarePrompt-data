### Reasoning:

The program is intended to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse occurs, given that each sign must occur sequentially and the i-th sign occurs every `a_i` years.

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `start_year` is initialized to 0. This variable keeps track of the current year as we progress through the signs.

2. **Processing Each Sign**:
   - For each sign `x` in the list of periodicities `nums`:
     - The program computes the next occurrence of the sign after `start_year` by finding the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`. This is done using the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
     - This formula ensures that we find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than `start_year`, which aligns with the requirement that each subsequent sign must occur strictly after the previous one.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all signs for a given test case, the program prints the final `start_year`, which represents the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the program's logic against the first example provided:

- **Input**:
  ```
  6
  3 2 4 5 9 18
  ```
- **Processing**:
  - **First Sign**: `start_year = 0`, next occurrence is at year `3` (smallest multiple of `3` greater than `0`).
  - **Second Sign**: `start_year = 3`, next occurrence is at year `4` (smallest multiple of `2` greater than `3`).
  - **Third Sign**: `start_year = 4`, next occurrence is at year `8` (smallest multiple of `4` greater than `4`).
  - **Fourth Sign**: `start_year = 8`, next occurrence is at year `10` (smallest multiple of `5` greater than `8`).
  - **Fifth Sign**: `start_year = 10`, next occurrence is at year `18` (smallest multiple of `9` greater than `10`).
  - **Sixth Sign**: `start_year = 18`, next occurrence is at year `36` (smallest multiple of `18` greater than `18`).
- **Output**:
  ```
  36
  ```

This matches the expected output, confirming that the program's logic is correct.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse occurs, given the constraints and requirements of the problem.

**Correctness: True**
