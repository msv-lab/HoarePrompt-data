You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. The signs must occur sequentially, where each subsequent sign can only occur after the previous one. The i-th sign occurs every a_i years, starting from year a_i, 2 * a_i, 3 * a_i, etc.

### Program Analysis

The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case as follows:
1. It reads the number of signs `n`.
2. It reads the list of periodicities `nums`.
3. It initializes `start_year` to 0.
4. It iterates through each periodicity `nums[x]` and updates `start_year` to the next occurrence of the sign after `start_year`.

The key part of the logic is the calculation inside the loop:
```python
start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
```
This line calculates the next year in which the i-th sign will occur after `start_year`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what this line does:
- `start_year + 1`: Moves to the next year from the current `start_year`.
- `(start_year + 1) // nums[x]`: Calculates how many full periods of `nums[x]` have passed since the start.
- `(start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1`: Moves to the next period.
- `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`: Calculates the year in which the next occurrence of the sign will happen.

### Verification with Example

Let's verify the program with the first example from the problem:

**Input:**
```
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
```

**Step-by-step Execution:**
1. `start_year = 0`
2. For the first sign (periodicity 3):
   - `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
3. For the second sign (periodicity 2):
   - `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
4. For the third sign (periodicity 4):
   - `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
5. For the fourth sign (periodicity 5):
   - `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
6. For the fifth sign (periodicity 9):
   - `start_year = ((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
7. For the sixth sign (periodicity 18):
   - `start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`

The output matches the expected result.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
