t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Each test case consists of two parts: the first part is an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 100, and the second part is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the integer n followed by the list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n for a particular test case.
