### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior using the annotations and the problem description.

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and their respective periodicities (`nums`).

2. **Logic for Calculating `start_year`:**
   - The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0.
   - For each periodicity `nums[x]`, the program calculates the next occurrence of the sign after `start_year` using the formula:
     ```python
     start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
     ```
   - This formula ensures that the next occurrence of the sign is calculated correctly by moving to the next period after `start_year`.

3. **Verification with Example:**
   - Let's verify the program with the first example from the problem:
     - **Input:**
       ```
       6
       3 2 4 5 9 18
       ```
     - **Step-by-step Execution:**
       - `start_year = 0`
       - For the first sign (periodicity 3):
         - `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
       - For the second sign (periodicity 2):
         - `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
       - For the third sign (periodicity 4):
         - `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
       - For the fourth sign (periodicity 5):
         - `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
       - For the fifth sign (periodicity 9):
         - `start_year = ((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
       - For the sixth sign (periodicity 18):
         - `start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
     - The output matches the expected result.

4. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations provided describe the state of the program at key points and correctly summarize the logic.
   - The annotations indicate that the `start_year` value is calculated for each test case based on the provided integers, which aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. The step-by-step execution and the annotations confirm that the program behaves as expected.

**Final: True**
