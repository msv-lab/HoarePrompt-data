### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicity of each sign. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the program works and whether it correctly implements the solution:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (the number of signs) and a list of `n` integers (`nums`) representing the periodicities of the signs.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The program initializes `start_year` to 0. This variable will keep track of the year when the current sign is expected to occur.
   - It then iterates through each sign's periodicity (`nums[x]`):
     - For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year using the formula: `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
     - This formula ensures that after the i-th sign occurs in `start_year`, the program waits for the (i+1)-th sign to occur strictly after `start_year`. The formula essentially finds the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints `start_year`, which represents the year when the n-th sign will occur.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **First Test Case**:
  - `n = 6`, `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - Iteration:
    - `start_year = 0`
    - First sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
    - Second sign: `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
    - Third sign: `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
    - Fourth sign: `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
    - Fifth sign: `start_year = ((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
    - Sixth sign: `start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
  - Output: `36`

- **Second Test Case**:
  - `n = 5`, `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - Iteration:
    - `start_year = 0`
    - First sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2`
    - Second sign: `start_year = ((2 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
    - Third sign: `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 6`
    - Fourth sign: `start_year = ((6 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
    - Fifth sign: `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
  - However, the correct output for this test case is `5` based on the problem statement, which implies the first occurrence of each sign in the sequence starting from year 1 (not year 0). The correct formula should be `start_year = ((start_year) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` to match the problem statement's requirement.

- **Third Test Case**:
  - `n = 5`, `nums = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Iteration:
    - `start_year = 0`
    - All signs will occur at `start_year = 5` based on the problem statement's requirement.
  - Output: `5`

- **Fourth Test Case**:
  - `n = 6`, `nums = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
  - Iteration:
    - `start_year = 0`
    - First sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`
    - Second sign: `start_year = ((50 + 1) // 30 + 1) * 30 = 90`
    - Third sign: `start_year = ((90 + 1) // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`
    - Fourth sign: `start_year = ((711 + 1) // 200 + 1) * 200 = 900`
    - Fifth sign: `start_year = ((900 + 1) // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`
    - Sixth sign: `start_year = ((1006 + 1) // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`
  - Output: `2012`

However, the second test case output is incorrect based on the problem statement, indicating a discrepancy in the formula. The formula should be adjusted to match the problem statement's requirement.

### Conclusion:

The program is mostly correct for the provided examples except for the second test case due to the discrepancy in the formula. The correct formula should be `start_year = ((start_year) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` to match the problem statement's requirement.

Thus, the correctness of the program is **False** because it does not handle the second test case correctly as per the problem statement.

**Correctness: False**
