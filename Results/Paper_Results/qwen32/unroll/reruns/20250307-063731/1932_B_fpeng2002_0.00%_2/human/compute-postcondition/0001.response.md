To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition `num_tests > 0`. The variable `num_tests` is the only one in the loop head that can be adjusted to satisfy this condition.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `num_tests` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.

The loop will execute as long as `num_tests` is greater than 0. Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes at least once, `num_tests` must be greater than 0.

No other variables in the provided state directly impact the execution of the `while` loop, so we only need to adjust `num_tests`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` must be greater than 0; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.**
