### Reasoning:

The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The goal is to determine the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs, given that each sign must occur sequentially and the `i`-th sign can only occur in years that are multiples of `a_i`.

The logic used in the program is as follows:
1. Initialize `start_year` to 0.
2. For each sign `x` in the list:
   - Update `start_year` to be the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than `start_year`.

The formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` ensures that `start_year` is set to the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than the current `start_year`. This is the correct approach to ensure that each sign occurs sequentially and strictly after the previous one.

Let's verify the logic with the provided example:
- For the first test case:
  - `start_year` starts at 0.
  - For the first sign (periodicity 3), `start_year` becomes 3.
  - For the second sign (periodicity 2), `start_year` becomes 4.
  - For the third sign (periodicity 4), `start_year` becomes 8.
  - For the fourth sign (periodicity 5), `start_year` becomes 10.
  - For the fifth sign (periodicity 9), `start_year` becomes 18.
  - For the sixth sign (periodicity 18), `start_year` becomes 36.
  - This matches the expected output of 36.

The logic correctly calculates the required year for the `n`-th sign to occur for all provided test cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
