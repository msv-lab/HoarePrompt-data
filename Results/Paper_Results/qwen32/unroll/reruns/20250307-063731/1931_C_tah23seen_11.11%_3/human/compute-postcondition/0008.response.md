To determine the output state, let's analyze the given loop and initial state.

Initial State:
- `i` and `j` are integers.
- `i` is less than or equal to `j`.
- `arr` is an array (implied by the loop, but not explicitly defined in the initial state).

Loop Code:
```python
while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
    i += 1
```
The loop continues to execute as long as the elements at index `i` and `i + 1` in the array `arr` are equal. Each time the loop executes, it increments `i` by 1.

### Analysis:
1. The loop will stop when `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
2. If all elements from `arr[i]` to `arr[j]` are the same, the loop will continue until `i` reaches `j` or an index out of bounds would occur (which is not the case here because the problem states `i` is initially less than or equal to `j`).
3. When the loop exits, `i` will point to the first index where the element is different from the next one, or it will be equal to `j` if all elements from `arr[i]` to `arr[j]` are the same.

### Output State:
After the loop finishes, `i` will be the smallest index such that `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`, or it will be `j` if all elements in the range from `i` to `j` are the same.

Output State: **`i` is the smallest index such that `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`, or `i` is equal to `j` if all elements from `arr[i]` to `arr[j]` are the same.**
