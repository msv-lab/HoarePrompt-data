### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the `func_1` function and evaluate whether it correctly computes the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.

1. **Initial Check (Two Pointers Approach):**
   - The function uses two pointers, `i` and `j`, initialized to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It iteratively moves `i` and `j` towards the center of the array as long as `arr[i] == arr[j]`.
   - If all elements are the same, `i` will eventually surpass `j`, and the function will return `0`, indicating no operation is needed.

2. **Finding the First Mismatch:**
   - If `i` does not surpass `j`, it indicates that there is a mismatch between the elements at `i` and `j`.
   - The function then increments `i` to the right as long as `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`. This step finds the smallest index `i` where the sequence of identical elements breaks.

3. **Determining the Cost:**
   - If `j` is not the last index of the array, the function calculates the cost as `j - i + 1`, which is the length of the segment that needs to be changed to make the array uniform.
   - If `j` is the last index, the function calculates the cost as `j - i`, which is also the length of the segment that needs to be changed.

### Analysis:

- The function correctly identifies the smallest segment that needs to be changed if the array is not already uniform.
- The cost calculation `j - i + 1` is appropriate when `j` is not the last index because it includes both endpoints of the segment.
- The cost calculation `j - i` is appropriate when `j` is the last index because the segment includes the element at `j` but not the element before `i`.

However, there is a subtle issue with the last return statement:
- When `j` is the last index, the function should return `j - i + 1` to correctly account for the segment length, not `j - i`.

### Conclusion:

The issue identified above means that the function does not handle the case where `j` is the last index correctly. Therefore, the function is not entirely correct.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **False**
