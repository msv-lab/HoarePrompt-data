Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to make all elements of an array equal by performing at most one operation of setting a contiguous subarray to a specific value. The cost of this operation is the length of the subarray. The goal is to minimize the cost.

### Program Analysis:
The given program appears to attempt to solve the problem by:
1. Identifying the longest prefix and suffix of the array that are equal.
2. If the entire array is already uniform (i.e., all elements are the same), it returns 0.
3. If not, it finds the first position from the start where the array elements change and the last position from the end where the array elements change.
4. It then calculates the cost to make the array uniform by setting the middle part (between the identified positions) to a uniform value.

### Detailed Steps:
1. **Initialization**: It initializes `i` to the start of the array and `j` to the end of the array.
2. **Identify Uniform Prefix and Suffix**: It iterates from both ends towards the center, checking if elements at `i` and `j` are equal. If they are, it moves `i` forward and `j` backward.
3. **Check if Entire Array is Uniform**: If `i` surpasses `j`, it means the entire array is already uniform, and it returns 0.
4. **Identify First Change from Start**: It checks if there are consecutive elements starting from `i` that are the same and moves `i` forward until it finds a change.
5. **Calculate Cost**: If `j` is not at the end of the array, it calculates the cost as `j - i + 1`. If `j` is at the end, it still calculates the cost as `j - i + 1`.

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic to find the cost is flawed. The program only considers the cost to change the middle part, but it does not consider other possible ways to make the array uniform with one operation.
- The program does not explore other potential optimal subarrays to change.
- The program assumes that the optimal solution is always to change the middle part, which is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Given the flawed logic and the fact that the program does not explore all possible ways to make the array uniform with one operation, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
