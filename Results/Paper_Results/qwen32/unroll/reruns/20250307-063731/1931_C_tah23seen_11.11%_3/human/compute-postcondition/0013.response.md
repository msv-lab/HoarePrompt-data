Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` where each integer is between 1 and the length of the list `arr`. The function returns 0 if a specific condition is met. Otherwise, it returns the length of a segment in the list or the length of the array minus the smallest index where consecutive elements differ.**
