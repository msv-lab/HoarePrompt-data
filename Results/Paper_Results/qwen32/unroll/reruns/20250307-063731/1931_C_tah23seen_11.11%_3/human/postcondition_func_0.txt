The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` where each integer is between 1 and the length of the list `arr`. It returns 0 if the list is a palindrome or if all elements from the start to the end are the same. Otherwise, it returns the length of the longest segment from the start or end of the list where all elements are the same.
