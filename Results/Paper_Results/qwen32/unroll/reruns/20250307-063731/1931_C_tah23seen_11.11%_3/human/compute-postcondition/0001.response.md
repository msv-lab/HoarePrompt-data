The variable `j` is assigned the value of `len(arr) - 1`, which is `n - 1` since `n` is the length of the list `arr`. The variable `i` remains `0`. The other conditions and values of the list `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`. The variable `i` is `0`. The variable `j` is `n - 1`.**
