Reasoning: 
The provided program is not correct based on the problem description. The function `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal. The function seems to be checking if the array is a palindrome or if all elements are the same, but this does not account for the optimal way to use the operation described in the problem.

The function does not consider the possibility of changing a segment of the array to make it uniform with minimal cost. Instead, it only checks if the array is already uniform or if it can be made uniform by changing a segment starting from either end, which is not always the optimal solution.

For example, consider the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]. The function would return 4, but the optimal solution is to change the segment [2, 3, 4, 5] to 1, which costs 4 burles, but a better solution would be to change the segment [1, 2, 3, 4] to 5, which also costs 4 burles, but the problem's solution suggests a cost of 4, which implies a different optimal operation that the function does not consider.

A correct approach would involve checking all possible segments and determining the minimum cost to make the entire array uniform, which is not what the current function does.

Correctness: **False**
