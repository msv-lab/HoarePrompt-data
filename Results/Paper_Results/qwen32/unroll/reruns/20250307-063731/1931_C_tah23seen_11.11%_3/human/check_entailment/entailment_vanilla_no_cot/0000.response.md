Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The current implementation only checks if the array is already equal or if it can be made equal by changing a segment at the beginning and end of the array. It does not consider the optimal way to use the single allowed operation to make all elements equal with the least cost.

For example, consider the test case:
```
3
1 2 3
```
The program will output `2`, but the correct answer is `1`. You can make all elements equal by choosing `i=1`, `j=2`, and `x=2` or `x=3`, which will cost `2-1+1=2` burles. However, choosing `i=1`, `j=3`, and `x=1` or `x=2` or `x=3` will cost `3-1+1=3` burles, and choosing `i=2`, `j=3`, and `x=2` or `x=3` will cost `3-2+1=2` burles. The optimal solution is to choose `i=1`, `j=2`, or `i=2`, `j=3`, both of which cost `2` burles, but there is a better solution: choose `i=1`, `j=3`, and `x=2` or `x=3` which costs `1` burles by changing the entire array to `2` or `3`.

The correct approach would involve finding the most frequent element in the array and calculating the cost to make all elements equal to that element by using the operation at most once. Alternatively, it could involve checking all possible segments to find the minimum cost to make the array uniform.
