You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n, and n is the length of the list arr. The function is called once for each test case, and the total number of elements across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i <= j:
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: 
    if (i > j) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: `i` and `j` are integers, and `i` is less than or equal to `j`
    while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: `i` is the smallest index such that `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`, or `i` is equal to `j` if all elements from `arr[i]` to `arr[j]` are the same.
    if (j != len(arr) - 1) :
        return j - i + 1
        #The program returns the length of the segment starting from index `i` to `j` inclusive, which is `j - i + 1`.
    #State: `i` is the smallest index such that `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`, or `i` is equal to `j` if all elements from `arr[i]` to `arr[j]` are the same. Additionally, `j` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`.
    return j - i
    #The program returns the length of the array `arr` minus the smallest index `i` such that `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`, or it returns 0 if all elements from `arr[i]` to `arr[j]` are the same.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` where each integer is between 1 and the length of the list `arr`. The function returns 0 if a specific condition is met. Otherwise, it returns the length of a segment in the list or the length of the array minus the smallest index where consecutive elements differ.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns the length of the segment starting from index `i` to `j` inclusive, which is `j - i + 1`.

Case_3: The program returns the length of the array `arr` minus the smallest index `i` such that `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`, or it returns 0 if all elements from `arr[i]` to `arr[j]` are the same.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
