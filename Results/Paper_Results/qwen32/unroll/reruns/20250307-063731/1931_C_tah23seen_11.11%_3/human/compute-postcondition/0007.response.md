To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` is true. The only variables we can adjust are `i` and `j` based on the given state and the loop condition.

Given:
- `i` and `j` are integers.
- `i` is less than or equal to `j`.

The loop condition is `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`. To satisfy this condition, we need to ensure that the elements at index `i` and `i + 1` in the array `arr` are equal.

Since the problem does not provide the specific values or the length of the array `arr`, we can only make general adjustments to `i` and `j` to ensure that `i` is within a valid range where `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]` can be compared.

Let's assume that `arr` has at least two elements for the comparison to be valid. Therefore, `j` must be at least 1 (since `i` starts at 0 and `i + 1` should be a valid index).

Given that `i` is already less than or equal to `j`, we need to ensure that `j` is at least 1 to allow the comparison `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` to be valid. If `i` is 0, then `j` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is at least 1.
- `arr[0]` is equal to `arr[1]`.

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is at least 1, `arr[0]` is equal to `arr[1]`**
