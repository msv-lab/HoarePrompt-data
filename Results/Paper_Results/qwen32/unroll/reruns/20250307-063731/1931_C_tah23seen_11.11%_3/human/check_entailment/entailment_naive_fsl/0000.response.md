Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal by performing at most one operation of setting a subarray to a single value. However, the logic in the function is flawed and does not handle all edge cases correctly.

Let's consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
The optimal operation would be to set the subarray from index 2 to 4 (1-based indexing) to the value 2. This would result in the array `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]`, which can then be made entirely 2s with one more operation, but since only one operation is allowed, the cost is `(4 - 2 + 1) = 3` burles. However, a better single operation would be to set the subarray from index 1 to 3 (1-based indexing) to the value 2, resulting in the array `[2, 2, 2, 2, 1]` with a cost of `(3 - 1 + 1) = 3` burles, or setting the subarray from index 3 to 5 (1-based indexing) to the value 2, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 2, 2, 2]` with a cost of `(5 - 3 + 1) = 3` burles. But the optimal solution is to set the subarray from index 2 to 4 (1-based indexing) to the value 2, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]` and then setting the subarray from index 1 to 1 (1-based indexing) to the value 2, resulting in the array `[2, 2, 2, 2, 1]` and then setting the subarray from index 5 to 5 (1-based indexing) to the value 2, resulting in the array `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` with a cost of `(4 - 2 + 1) = 3` burles. But the optimal solution is to set the subarray from index 2 to 4 (1-based indexing) to the value 2, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]` and then setting the subarray from index 1 to 5 (1-based indexing) to the value 2, resulting in the array `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` with a cost of `(5 - 1 + 1) = 5` burles.
