arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the size of the array (n) followed by n integers (1 \le a_i \le n) representing the elements of the array. The first element of arr is t (1 \le t \le 10^4), the number of test cases. For each test case, the first integer is n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5) and the next n integers are the elements of the array. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
