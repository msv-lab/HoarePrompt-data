You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to make all elements of an array equal by performing at most one operation of setting a contiguous subarray to a specific value. The cost of this operation is the length of the subarray. The goal is to minimize the cost.

### Program Analysis:
The given program appears to attempt to solve the problem by:
1. Identifying the longest prefix and suffix of the array that are equal.
2. If the entire array is already uniform (i.e., all elements are the same), it returns 0.
3. If not, it finds the first position from the start where the array elements change and the last position from the end where the array elements change.
4. It then calculates the cost to make the array uniform by setting the middle part (between the identified positions) to a uniform value.

### Detailed Steps:
1. **Initialization**: It initializes `i` to the start of the array and `j` to the end of the array.
2. **Identify Uniform Prefix and Suffix**: It iterates from both ends towards the center, checking if elements at `i` and `j` are equal. If they are, it moves `i` forward and `j` backward.
3. **Check if Entire Array is Uniform**: If `i` surpasses `j`, it means the entire array is already uniform, and it returns 0.
4. **Identify First Change from Start**: It checks if there are consecutive elements starting from `i` that are the same and moves `i` forward until it finds a change.
5. **Calculate Cost**: If `j` is not at the end of the array, it calculates the cost as `j - i + 1`. If `j` is at the end, it still calculates the cost as `j - i + 1`.

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic to find the cost is flawed. The program only considers the cost to change the middle part, but it does not consider other possible ways to make the array uniform with one operation.
- The program does not explore other potential optimal subarrays to change.
- The program assumes that the optimal solution is always to change the middle part, which is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Given the flawed logic and the fact that the program does not explore all possible ways to make the array uniform with one operation, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
