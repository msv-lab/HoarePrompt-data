To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the condition `i <= j` in the loop statement. Given the initial state where `i` is `0` and `j` is `n - 1`, we need to ensure that `0 <= n - 1`.

Let's break down the conditions:

- `i` is `0`.
- `j` is `n - 1`.

The condition `i <= j` translates to `0 <= n - 1`. This inequality holds true as long as `n` is at least `1` (since `n - 1` will then be `0`, and `0 <= 0` is true).

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `i` or `j` as long as `n` is at least `1`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr` and `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `0`, `j` is `n - 1`**
