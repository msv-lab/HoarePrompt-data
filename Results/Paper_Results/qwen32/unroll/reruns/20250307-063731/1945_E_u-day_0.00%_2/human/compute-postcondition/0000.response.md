To determine the output state after the execution of the code snippet, we need to understand the effect of the function `func_1()`. Since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the provided context, we can only infer that it returns a tuple of two values, which are then unpacked into `n` and `k`.

Given the initial state, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n. After executing `n, k = func_1()`, the values of `n` and `k` will be whatever `func_1()` returns. The other variables (`arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, `st`) are not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State will reflect the new values of `n` and `k` as returned by `func_1()`, while the other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of size `n`, `pos` is an integer representing the index of the element `k` in `arr`, if it exists, `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm, with 0 <= `low` < `high` <= n-1, `st` is a set of integers representing the midpoints visited during the binary search.**
