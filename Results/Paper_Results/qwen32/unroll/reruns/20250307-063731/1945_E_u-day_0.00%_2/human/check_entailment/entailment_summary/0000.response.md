### Reasoning:

The provided solution does not fully meet the problem requirements. Let's break down the problem and the solution to understand why.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Input**: A permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` that needs to be found.
2. **Operations**: Perform up to 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation such that after performing a binary search, the element at the position `l` is equal to `x`.
3. **Binary Search**: The binary search algorithm is applied on the modified permutation to find the element `x`.
4. **Output**: The number of swaps performed and the indices of the swaps.

#### Analysis of the Provided Code:
- **Function `func_1`**: Reads a line of input and returns a map object of integers.
- **Function `func_2`**: Converts the map object returned by `func_1` to a list.
- **Function `func_3`**: 
  - Reads the size of the permutation `n` and the target number `x`.
  - Reads the permutation `arr`.
  - Finds the position `pos` of the element `x` in the permutation.
  - Performs a binary search on the permutation to find the element `x`.
  - If `x` is found at the `low` index, it prints `0`.
  - Otherwise, it prints `1` and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

#### Issues in the Provided Code:
1. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in `func_3` is correct for finding the element `x`, but it does not account for the requirement to perform up to 2 swaps to ensure the element `x` is found at the position `l` after the binary search.
2. **Swaps**: The code does not perform any swaps to modify the permutation before the binary search. It only prints the indices if `x` is not found at the `low` index, which is not sufficient to meet the problem requirements.
3. **Output**: The output is incorrect because it does not guarantee that the binary search will find `x` at the position `l` after performing up to 2 swaps.

#### Correct Approach:
1. **Identify the Position of `x`**: Find the index `pos` of the element `x` in the permutation.
2. **Binary Search Preparation**: Determine the indices that need to be swapped to ensure that `x` is found at the position `l` after the binary search.
3. **Perform Swaps**: Perform up to 2 swaps to modify the permutation accordingly.
4. **Output**: Print the number of swaps and the indices of the swaps.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to perform the required swaps to ensure the binary search finds the element `x` at the position `l`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
