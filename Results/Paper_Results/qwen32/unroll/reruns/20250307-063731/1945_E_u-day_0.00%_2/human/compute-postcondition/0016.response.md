Functionality: **The function performs a binary search on a list `arr` to find the element `k`. It prints `0` if `k` is found at the `low` index, otherwise it prints `1` and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`. Here, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `-1` if `k` is not present.**
