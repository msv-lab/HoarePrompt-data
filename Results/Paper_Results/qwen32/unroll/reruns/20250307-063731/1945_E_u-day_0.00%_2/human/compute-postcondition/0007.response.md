To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the condition `low + 1 < high`. The variables `low` and `high` are the only ones mentioned in the loop condition.

Given:
- `low` is initialized to 0.
- `high` is initialized to `n - 1`.

The loop condition `low + 1 < high` must be true for the loop to execute. Let's analyze this:

1. **Initial Values**: `low` is 0 and `high` is `n - 1`.
2. **Condition**: `low + 1 < high` translates to `0 + 1 < n - 1` or `1 < n - 1`. This simplifies to `2 < n`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 2.

No other variables in the loop condition need adjustment. The values of `n` and `k` are the results of `func_1()`, `arr` is the list of integers from `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1, and `st` is an empty set. None of these variables affect the loop condition `low + 1 < high`.

Thus, the required state adjustment is ensuring that `n` is greater than 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list of integers returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not in `arr`, `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `st` is an empty set**.
