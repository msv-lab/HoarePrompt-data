The code snippet sets the variable `pos` to -1. This means that the index of the element `k` in the list `arr` is not found or is being reset to an initial state indicating no position has been found yet. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `arr`, `low`, `high`, `st`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list of integers returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is -1, `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm, with 0 <= `low` < `high` <= n-1, `st` is a set of integers representing the midpoints visited during the binary search.**
