Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not always correctly solve the problem. Specifically, it only performs one swap if necessary and does not guarantee that after at most two swaps, the binary search will correctly identify the position of `x` as `p_l`. The program's logic for determining when and how to swap elements is insufficient to handle all cases where two swaps might be necessary.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Single Swap Logic**: The program only performs one swap if `p_l` is not equal to `x` after the initial binary search. However, the problem states that up to two swaps are allowed and that two swaps are always sufficient.

2. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search implementation is correct in the sense that it finds the correct position `low` where `p_l` should be equal to `x` if no swaps are needed. However, the logic for determining the swaps is flawed.

3. **Handling Two Swaps**: The program does not consider scenarios where two swaps are necessary to correctly position `x` so that it is found at `p_l` after the binary search.

To fix the program, a more robust approach to determine the necessary swaps is required. This could involve checking the positions of `x` and the elements that would need to be swapped to ensure that after the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`. This might involve more complex logic to determine the optimal swaps.

Here is a possible corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())

def func_2():
    return list(func_1())

def func_3():
    (n, x) = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos_x = arr.index(x)
    
    # Perform binary search to find the position where x should be
    low, high = 0, n - 1
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] > x:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
    
    # If x is already at the correct position
    if arr[low] == x:
        print(0)
        return
    
    # Perform the first swap to bring x closer to the correct position
    if arr[low] < x:
        arr[low], arr[pos_x] = arr[pos_x], arr[low]
        print(1)
        print(low + 1, pos_x + 1)
        return
    
    # If one swap is not enough, perform the second swap
    # Find the smallest element greater than x to swap with x
    for i in range(low + 1, n):
        if arr[i] > x:
            arr[i], arr[pos_x] = arr[pos_x], arr[i]
            print(2)
            print(pos_x + 1, i + 1)
            print(low + 1, pos_x + 1)
            return

# Read the number of test cases
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_3()
```

This corrected version ensures that up to two swaps are performed if necessary to position `x` correctly for the binary search to find it at `p_l`.
