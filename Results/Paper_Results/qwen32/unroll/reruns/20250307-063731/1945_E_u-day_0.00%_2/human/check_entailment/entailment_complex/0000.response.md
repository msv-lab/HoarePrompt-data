### Reasoning:

The provided code is intended to solve the problem where a permutation of integers and a target number \( x \) are given. The goal is to perform at most two swaps in the permutation to ensure that after a binary search, the element at the index \( l \) (left boundary of the search range) is equal to \( x \).

Here's a detailed breakdown of the code and its correctness:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The main loop iterates over the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `func_1()` reads two integers: \( n \) (the length of the permutation) and \( x \) (the target number).
   - `func_2()` reads the permutation list.

2. **Finding the Position of \( x \):**
   - The code searches for the position \( pos \) of the target number \( x \) in the permutation array.

3. **Binary Search Simulation:**
   - The binary search is simulated to find the point where the search range narrows down to two adjacent indices \( low \) and \( high \).
   - The midpoints visited during the binary search are stored in a set \( st \).

4. **Determining the Output:**
   - If the element at index \( low \) is \( x \), it prints `0` indicating no swaps are needed.
   - Otherwise, it prints `1` and the indices \( low + 1 \) and \( pos + 1 \) indicating a single swap is needed to bring \( x \) to the correct position.

### Issues:
- **Binary Search Logic:** The binary search logic seems correct in the context of finding the position where the search range narrows down to two adjacent indices.
- **Swapping Logic:** The swapping logic assumes that a single swap is sufficient, which is not always true according to the problem statement. The problem guarantees that two swaps are always sufficient, but the provided code only handles one swap.
- **Edge Cases:** The code does not handle cases where the target \( x \) is not present in the permutation or where more than one swap is required.

### Correctness:
Given the problem statement and the provided code, the code is **incorrect** because it does not handle the possibility of needing two swaps, which is explicitly mentioned in the problem description.

**Correctness: False**
