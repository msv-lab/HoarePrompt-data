You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem requirements for all potential cases. Specifically, the program is only performing a binary search and potentially swapping one element to make the binary search successful, but it does not guarantee that it can always find the element `x` using at most 2 swaps.

### Issues:
1. **Binary Search Without Sorting**: The program attempts to perform a binary search on an unsorted permutation, which is not valid according to the problem description. The binary search algorithm requires a sorted array to function correctly.

2. **Limited Swaps**: The program is only performing one swap if the initial binary search fails, but the problem description states that up to two swaps are allowed. The program should explore using both swaps if necessary.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where `x` is not present in the permutation or where multiple swaps are required to correctly position `x` for the binary search to succeed.

### Potential Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```
In this case, the element `3` is at index `1` (0-based). The binary search will fail without any swaps because the array is not sorted. The program should swap elements to make the binary search successful, potentially using up to 2 swaps.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Identify the position of `x` in the permutation.
2. Perform up to 2 swaps to rearrange the array such that a binary search can find `x`.
3. Output the number of swaps and the indices of the swapped elements.

The provided program does not implement this logic correctly, and thus it is incorrect.
