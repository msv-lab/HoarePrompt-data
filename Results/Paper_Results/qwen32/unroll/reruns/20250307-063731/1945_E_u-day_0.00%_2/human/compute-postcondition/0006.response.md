The code snippet provided is `st = set()`. This line reassigns the variable `st` to a new empty set, effectively clearing any previous values it might have held.

Given the initial state, `st` was a set of integers representing the midpoints visited during the binary search. After executing `st = set()`, `st` is now an empty set, while all other variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list of integers returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not in `arr`, `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `st` is an empty set.**
