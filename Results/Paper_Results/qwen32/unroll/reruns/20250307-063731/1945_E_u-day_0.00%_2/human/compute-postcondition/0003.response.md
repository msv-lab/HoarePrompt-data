The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the range of the loop is defined by `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variables `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, and `st` are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list of integers returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is -1, `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm, with 0 <= `low` < `high` <= n-1, `st` is a set of integers representing the midpoints visited during the binary search.**
