To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's analyze the code:

The given loop iterates over the list `arr` and checks if any element in `arr` is equal to `k`. If it finds such an element, it updates the variable `pos` with the index of that element. The variables `low`, `high`, `st`, `n`, and `k` are not modified within the loop.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is the length of the list `arr`.
2. During each iteration, it checks if `arr[i]` is equal to `k`.
3. If `arr[i]` is equal to `k`, it sets `pos` to `i`.
4. If no element in `arr` equals `k`, `pos` remains `-1`.

Given this, the final value of `pos` will be the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present. If `k` is not present in `arr`, `pos` will remain `-1`.

Other variables (`low`, `high`, `st`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list of integers returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not in `arr`, `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm, with 0 <= `low` < `high` <= n-1, `st` is a set of integers representing the midpoints visited during the binary search.**
