The code snippet assigns the value `0` to `low` and the value `n - 1` to `high`. The other variables `n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, and `st` remain unchanged. Since `n` is the length of the list `arr`, the value of `high` is the last valid index of the list `arr`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list of integers returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not in `arr`, `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `st` is a set of integers representing the midpoints visited during the binary search.**
