You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n. arr is a list of integers representing the permutation of size n. pos is an integer representing the index of the element k in arr, if it exists. low and high are integers representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm, with 0 <= low < high <= n-1. st is a set of integers representing the midpoints visited during the binary search.
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list of integers returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not in `arr`, `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm, with 0 <= `low` < `high` <= n-1, `st` is a set of integers representing the midpoints visited during the binary search.
    low, high = 0, n - 1
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: low and high are adjacent indices, and st contains the set of mid values calculated during the loop.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: low + 1, pos + 1 (where low and pos are indices in the array `arr`)
    #State: low and high are adjacent indices, and st contains the set of mid values calculated during the loop. If the value at `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, then `arr[low]` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, and `st`. `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of size `n`, `pos` is an integer representing the index of the element `k` in `arr` if it exists, `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm with 0 <= low < high <= n-1, and `st` is a set of integers representing the midpoints visited during the binary search. The function performs a binary search on the array `arr` to find the element `k` within the range defined by `low` and `high`. If `k` is found, it returns the index of `k` in `arr`. If `k` is not found, it returns -1.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
