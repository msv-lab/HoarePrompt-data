### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by performing a binary search on the permutation with up to two possible swaps to ensure that the element `x` is found at the correct position after the search. However, the logic in `func_3` is flawed, and it does not guarantee that the correct swaps will be performed to achieve the desired outcome.

Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Binary Search Misunderstanding**: The binary search in `func_3` is not correctly implemented. It does not handle the case where `x` is not found in the initial segment of the array correctly. Instead of performing the correct swaps, it only checks if the element at `arr[low]` is equal to `x`.

2. **Swapping Strategy**: The program only considers one swap if `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`. However, it does not ensure that the swap will result in the correct position for `x` after the binary search. The problem states that up to two swaps are allowed, but the program does not utilize this flexibility.

3. **Output Handling**: The program outputs `0` swaps if `arr[low]` equals `x`, which is correct. However, if `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`, it outputs one swap, but this swap may not be sufficient to place `x` at the correct position after the binary search.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues described, the program does not guarantee that the binary search will correctly find the element `x` after performing up to two swaps. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
