Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, and `st`. `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of size `n`, `pos` is an integer representing the index of the element `k` in `arr` if it exists, `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm with 0 <= low < high <= n-1, and `st` is a set of integers representing the midpoints visited during the binary search. The function performs a binary search on the array `arr` to find the element `k` within the range defined by `low` and `high`. If `k` is found, it returns the index of `k` in `arr`. If `k` is not found, it returns -1.**
