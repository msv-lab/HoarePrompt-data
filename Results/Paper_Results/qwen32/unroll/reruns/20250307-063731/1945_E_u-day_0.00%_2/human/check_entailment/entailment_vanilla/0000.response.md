Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
- We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` that needs to be found.
- We can perform up to 2 swaps to arrange the permutation such that after performing a binary search, `p_l` equals `x`.
- The binary search algorithm is provided in the problem statement.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - `func_1` reads a line of input and converts it into a map of integers.
   - `func_2` converts the map of integers into a list.
   - `func_3` handles the main logic for each test case.

2. **Finding the Position of `x`**:
   - The program iterates through the permutation to find the position `pos` of the number `x`.

3. **Binary Search Simulation**:
   - The program initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `n-1`.
   - It then enters a loop that continues until `low + 1` is equal to `high`.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates the middle index `mid` and checks if the element at `mid` is greater than `x` to adjust `low` or `high`.

4. **Output**:
   - If the element at `low` is equal to `x`, it prints `0` indicating no swaps were needed.
   - Otherwise, it prints `1` indicating one swap was performed, and it suggests swapping the elements at positions `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The program simulates the binary search but does not actually rearrange the array based on the two allowed swaps.
   - The program only checks if the element at `low` is `x` after the simulation, which is not sufficient to ensure that `p_l` will be `x` after performing the actual binary search on the modified array.

2. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The program suggests a swap between `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, but it does not actually perform the swap and check if the binary search will yield the correct result.
   - The program does not utilize the second allowed swap to further adjust the array.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where `x` is not present in the array, which should not happen as per the problem statement, but the logic should be robust.
   - The program does not consider scenarios where two swaps are necessary to achieve the desired result.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as it does not actually rearrange the array to ensure that the binary search will yield the correct result after at most two swaps.

**Correctness: False**
