To determine what will be printed by the `print(low + 1, pos + 1)` statement, let's break down the given information:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `low` and `high` are adjacent indices in some list or array.
   - `st` contains the set of mid values calculated during a loop.
   - The element at index `low` in `arr` is not equal to `k`.

2. **Variables:**
   - `low`: An index in the list or array `arr`.
   - `pos`: Another index in the list or array `arr` (its value is not explicitly mentioned in the precondition).

Since the exact values of `low` and `pos` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables. The statement `print(low + 1, pos + 1)` will print the values of `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

Given that `low` and `pos` are indices, adding 1 to them would indicate the next position in a 1-based index system (as opposed to the 0-based index system commonly used in Python).

### Explanation:
- `low + 1`: This represents the position next to `low` in a 1-based index system.
- `pos + 1`: This represents the position next to `pos` in a 1-based index system.

Output: **low + 1, pos + 1 (where low and pos are indices in the array `arr`)**
