Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem requirements for all potential cases. Specifically, the program is only performing a binary search and potentially swapping one element to make the binary search successful, but it does not guarantee that it can always find the element `x` using at most 2 swaps.

### Issues:
1. **Binary Search Without Sorting**: The program attempts to perform a binary search on an unsorted permutation, which is not valid according to the problem description. The binary search algorithm requires a sorted array to function correctly.

2. **Limited Swaps**: The program is only performing one swap if the initial binary search fails, but the problem description states that up to two swaps are allowed. The program should explore using both swaps if necessary.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where `x` is not present in the permutation or where multiple swaps are required to correctly position `x` for the binary search to succeed.

### Potential Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```
In this case, the element `3` is at index `1` (0-based). The binary search will fail without any swaps because the array is not sorted. The program should swap elements to make the binary search successful, potentially using up to 2 swaps.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Identify the position of `x` in the permutation.
2. Perform up to 2 swaps to rearrange the array such that a binary search can find `x`.
3. Output the number of swaps and the indices of the swapped elements.

The provided program does not implement this logic correctly, and thus it is incorrect.
