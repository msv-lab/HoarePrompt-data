Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
We need to rearrange a permutation `p` of size `n` such that after performing at most 2 swaps, a binary search algorithm will find the number `x` at the position `l` when the loop terminates.

### Binary Search Process:
The binary search algorithm works as follows:
- Initialize `l = 0` and `r = n`.
- While `r - l > 1`:
  - Compute `m = floor((r + l) / 2)`.
  - If `p[m] <= x`, set `l = m`.
  - Otherwise, set `r = m`.
- The loop terminates when `r - l = 1`, and the final `l` should point to the element `x`.

### Key Points:
- The binary search is performed on a potentially unsorted permutation.
- We are allowed to make up to 2 swaps to ensure `p[l] == x` after the search.
- The solution should output the number of swaps and their positions.

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the provided code:

1. **Input Reading:**
   ```python
   def func_1():
       return map(int, input().split())

   def func_2():
       return list(func_1())
   ```
   These functions read integers from the input and convert them into a list.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   ```python
   def func_3():
       (n, k) = func_1()
       arr = func_2()
       pos = -1
       for i in range(n):
           if arr[i] == k:
               pos = i
       (low, high) = (0, n - 1)
       st = set()
       while low + 1 < high:
           mid = (low + high) // 2
           st.add(mid)
           if arr[mid] > k:
               high = mid
           else:
               low = mid
       if arr[low] == k:
           print(0)
       else:
           print(1)
           print(low + 1, pos + 1)
   ```
   - The code first finds the position of `k` in the array.
   - It then performs a binary search on the array.
   - If `arr[low]` equals `k` after the search, it prints `0` (no swaps needed).
   - Otherwise, it swaps the element at `low` with the element at `pos` (the position of `k`).

### Issues and Corrections:
- **Assumption of Sorted Array:** The binary search assumes the array is sorted. The provided code does not sort the array before performing the search.
- **Swapping Logic:** The code only performs one swap if `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, which may not be sufficient in all cases. The problem guarantees that two swaps are always sufficient, but the code only handles one swap.
- **Output Format:** The code correctly outputs the number of swaps and the swap positions, but the logic is flawed due to the unsorted array and limited swap handling.

### Conclusion:
Given the above points, the provided program is incorrect because it does not handle the unsorted array correctly and does not ensure that at most two swaps will lead to the correct result.

**Correctness: False**
