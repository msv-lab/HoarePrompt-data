Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

# Annotated Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_3()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_1`, as it directly takes input from the user and returns a map object of integers.
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers that were input by the user, separated by spaces.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_2` does not take any parameters. It returns a list that is the result of calling another function `func_1`.
def func_2():
    return list(func_1())
    #The program returns a list that is the result of calling the function `func_1`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n. arr is a list of integers representing the permutation of size n. pos is an integer representing the index of the element k in arr, if it exists. low and high are integers representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm, with 0 <= low < high <= n-1. st is a set of integers representing the midpoints visited during the binary search.

    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list of integers returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not in `arr`, `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm, with 0 <= `low` < `high` <= n-1, `st` is a set of integers representing the midpoints visited during the binary search.
    low, high = 0, n - 1
    st = set()

        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: low and high are adjacent indices, and st contains the set of mid values calculated during the loop.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: low + 1, pos + 1 (where low and pos are indices in the array `arr`)
    #State: low and high are adjacent indices, and st contains the set of mid values calculated during the loop. If the value at `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, then `arr[low]` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.
