The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state describes several variables (`low`, `high`, `st`, `arr`, and `k`), but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is not influenced by these variables.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. The initial state provides information about variables `low`, `high`, `st`, `arr`, and `k`.
2. The `print(1)` statement is independent of these variables and directly outputs the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
