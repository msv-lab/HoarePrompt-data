The code snippet provided is `arr = func_2()`, which means the variable `arr` is being reassigned to the value returned by the function `func_2()`. This change impacts the variable `arr`, but the values of `n`, `k`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, and `st` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list of integers returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is an integer representing the index of the element `k` in `arr`, if it exists, `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm, with 0 <= `low` < `high` <= n-1, `st` is a set of integers representing the midpoints visited during the binary search.**
