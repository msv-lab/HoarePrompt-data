To determine the output state after the loop has executed, let's analyze the given loop and initial state.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_1()`.
- `arr` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()`.
- `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not in `arr`.
- `low` is initialized to 0.
- `high` is initialized to `n - 1`.
- `st` (a set) is initialized to be empty.

### Loop Code:
```python
while low + 1 < high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    st.add(mid)
    if arr[mid] > k:
        high = mid
    else:
        low = mid
```

### Analysis:
The loop is a binary search variant. It continues to narrow down the search range between `low` and `high` until `low` and `high` are adjacent. The variable `mid` is calculated as the middle index of the current range, and `mid` is added to the set `st`. Depending on whether `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, either `high` or `low` is adjusted to `mid`.

### Termination Condition:
The loop terminates when `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`, meaning `low` and `high` are adjacent indices.

### Output State:
- `low` and `high` will be adjacent indices after the loop terminates.
- `st` will contain the set of `mid` values that were calculated during the loop iterations.

### Natural Language Description:
After the loop finishes, `low` and `high` will be two adjacent indices. The set `st` will contain all the `mid` values that were calculated during the binary search process. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **low and high are adjacent indices, and st contains the set of mid values calculated during the loop.**
