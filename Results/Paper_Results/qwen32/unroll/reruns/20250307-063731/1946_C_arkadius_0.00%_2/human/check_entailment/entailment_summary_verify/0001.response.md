To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's carefully analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summaries. We will verify if the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem.

### Problem Breakdown:
The task is to find the maximum number `x` such that after removing exactly `k` edges from the tree, each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Tree Representation:**
   - The program uses a custom `Tree` class to represent the tree structure.
   - Each vertex in the tree has a list of children and keeps track of the number of good components and the remaining size.

2. **DFS Traversal:**
   - `func_1` and `func_2` perform a depth-first search (DFS) to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size for each subtree.
   - `func_1` uses an iterative approach with a stack to avoid recursion depth issues.
   - `func_2` is a recursive version of the DFS traversal.

3. **Feasibility Check:**
   - `func_3` checks if it's possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `x` vertices.
   - It uses the results from `func_1` to determine the number of good components and the remaining size.

4. **Binary Search:**
   - `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.
   - It uses `func_3` to check the feasibility of each midpoint value during the binary search.

5. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_5` reads the input, constructs the tree, roots the tree, and then calls `func_4` to find the result for each test case.

### Function Summaries:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function performs a DFS to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size for each subtree iteratively.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function performs a DFS to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size for each subtree recursively.
- **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function checks if it's possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `x` vertices.
- **Function 4 (`func_4`)**: This function performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.
- **Function 5 (`func_5`)**: This function reads the input, constructs the tree, roots the tree, and then calls `func_4` to find the result for each test case.

### Verification:
- **Binary Search (`func_4`)**: The binary search is correctly implemented to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition. It uses `func_3` to check the feasibility of each midpoint value.
- **Feasibility Check (`func_3`)**: The feasibility check correctly determines if it's possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `x` vertices. It uses the results from `func_1` to determine the number of good components and the remaining size.
- **DFS Traversal (`func_1` and `func_2`)**: The DFS traversal correctly calculates the number of good components and the remaining size for each subtree. Both the iterative (`func_1`) and recursive (`func_2`) versions are correct.
- **Tree Construction and Rooting**: The tree is correctly constructed and rooted before the binary search is performed.

### Function Summary Verification:
The function summary for `func_5` is slightly inaccurate. It states that the function calculates and prints the number of connected components in the tree after removing `k` edges, which is not correct. Instead, `func_5` calculates and prints the maximum `x` such that after removing exactly `k` edges, each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.

### Conclusion:
Despite the minor inaccuracy in the function summary for `func_5`, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It efficiently uses binary search and DFS to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.

Final: **True**
