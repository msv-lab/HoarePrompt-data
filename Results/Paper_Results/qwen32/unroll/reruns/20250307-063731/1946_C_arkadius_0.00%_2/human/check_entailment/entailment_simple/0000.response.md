### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by using a binary search approach to find the maximum possible size `x` of the smallest connected component after removing exactly `k` edges from a tree. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Tree Representation**:
   - The `TreeNode` class represents each node in the tree, storing information about its edges, children, subtree size, parent, and properties related to the current state of the search.
   - The `Tree` class represents the entire tree with methods to add edges and root the tree.

2. **Tree Rooting**:
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method root the tree from a given vertex `v` to ensure that each node has a parent and children are correctly identified.

3. **Component Validation**:
   - `func_1` and `func_2` perform a post-order traversal of the tree to count the number of good components (components with size at least `x`) and the remaining size of components that are smaller than `x`.
   - These functions update each node's `good_components` and `remaining_size` based on its children.

4. **Feasibility Check**:
   - `func_3` checks if it is possible to have exactly `k` good components with a minimum size of `x` after removing `k` edges.
   - It uses the results from `func_1` to determine if the current `x` is feasible.

5. **Binary Search**:
   - `func_4` performs a binary search to find the largest possible `x` that satisfies the conditions.
   - It repeatedly checks the feasibility of `x` using `func_3` and adjusts the search range accordingly.

6. **Main Function**:
   - `func_5` reads input for each test case, constructs the tree, roots it, and then uses `func_4` to find and print the maximum `x`.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic described above. It uses a binary search to efficiently find the maximum possible size `x` of the smallest connected component after removing `k` edges. The tree rooting, post-order traversal, and feasibility check are all implemented correctly and consistently.

The program handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly processes multiple test cases and outputs the expected results.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and the annotated states.

### Correctness: **True**
