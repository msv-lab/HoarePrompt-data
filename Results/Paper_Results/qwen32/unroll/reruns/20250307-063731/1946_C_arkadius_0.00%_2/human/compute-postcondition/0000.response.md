The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in a tree, and `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that `1 <= k < n`. After executing the code, the values of `n` and `k` will be updated to the values read from the input.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, and `1 <= k < n`.**
