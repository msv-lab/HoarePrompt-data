To determine what will be printed by the `print(func_4(tree, n, k))` statement, we need to understand the context and behavior of the `func_4` function given the initial state of the program. However, the initial state does not provide any specific details about the `func_4` function or its behavior. Therefore, we can infer the output based on the information provided.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State**:
    - `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
    - `tree` is a rooted tree structure with node `0` as the root.

2. **Function Call**:
    - The `print` statement calls `func_4(tree, n, k)`.
    - Since the details of `func_4` are not provided, we can only infer the output based on the information given about the inputs.

### Description of Inputs:
- `tree`: Represents a rooted tree structure with node `0` as the root. This structure typically includes information about the nodes and their connections.
- `n`: An integer representing the number of nodes in the tree.
- `k`: An integer, the exact purpose of which is not specified in the initial state.

### Inference:
Given that the initial state does not provide the implementation details of `func_4`, we can only describe the output in terms of the function's parameters and the structure of the tree.

### Possible Scenarios:
- If `func_4` is a function that calculates a specific property of the tree (e.g., height of the tree, number of leaves, sum of node values, etc.), the output will be the result of that calculation.
- If `func_4` is a function that modifies the tree and returns a specific value or structure, the output will be that modified value or structure.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact behavior of `func_4` is not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of the function's parameters and the tree structure. The output will be whatever `func_4` returns given the `tree`, `n`, and `k`.

### Final Output:
Output: **result of func_4(tree, n, k) (where result is the value returned by the function func_4 given the tree structure, n nodes, and k)**
