The code snippet creates an instance of the `Tree` class with `n` as an argument. This means a new `Tree` object named `tree` is created, and it is initialized with the value of `n`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as per the provided initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, and `1 <= k < n`; `tree` is an instance of `Tree` initialized with `n`.**
