The code snippet `tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)` suggests that the `root_tree_non_recursive` method of the `tree` object is called with `0` as the root node and `-1` as the parent of the root node (indicating that the root node has no parent).

Given the initial state, the method `root_tree_non_recursive` likely modifies the internal structure of the `tree` object to establish a rooted tree structure with node `0` as the root. However, the method does not change the number of nodes (`n`) or the number of edges (`n-1`). The method also does not change the edges themselves but rather their orientation and possibly their representation within the `tree` object to reflect the rooted tree structure.

Since the problem does not specify the details of the `root_tree_non_recursive` method or the internal representation of the `tree` object, we can infer that the method primarily affects the internal state of the `tree` object. The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged as per the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged; the `tree` object now has a rooted tree structure with node `0` as the root.**
