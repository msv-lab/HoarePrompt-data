To determine if the given program is correct, we need to understand the logic and functionality of each function and how they work together to solve the problem.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Tree Structure and Initialization:**
   - The program defines a `Tree` class which is not provided in the code snippet. It's assumed that this class handles the tree structure, including adding edges and rooting the tree.
   - The `Tree` class should have methods to manage the tree nodes and their relationships, such as `add_edge` and `root_tree_non_recursive`.

2. **Main Logic Functions:**
   - **`func_1` and `func_2`:** These functions perform a depth-first search (DFS) on the tree. They are supposed to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at a given vertex `v` where the size of each component is at least `x`.
     - `func_1` uses a stack to implement an iterative DFS.
     - `func_2` uses a recursive DFS.
   - Both functions are intended to return a tuple containing:
     - The number of good components.
     - The remaining size of the subtree.
   - The logic in both functions is similar, and they should provide the same results.

3. **Checking Feasibility (`func_3`):**
   - This function checks if it's possible to have at least `k` good components with each component size at least `x` by calling `func_1`.
   - It returns `True` if the conditions are met, otherwise `False`.

4. **Binary Search (`func_4`):**
   - This function performs a binary search over the possible values of `x` to find the maximum `x` such that it's possible to remove exactly `k` edges and have each remaining component of size at least `x`.
   - It uses `func_3` to check the feasibility of each `x` value.

5. **Main Function (`func_5`):**
   - This function reads the input for each test case, constructs the tree, roots the tree, and then calls `func_4` to find the maximum `x`.

### Potential Issues

- **Tree Class Implementation:** The `Tree` class is not provided, and its implementation is crucial for the correctness of the program. If the `Tree` class does not correctly manage the tree structure and relationships, the DFS functions will not work as intended.
- **DFS Consistency:** Both `func_1` and `func_2` are supposed to perform the same task using different methods (iterative and recursive). If there is a discrepancy in their logic or implementation, the results may differ.
- **Input Handling:** The input handling seems correct, as it reads the number of vertices and edges, constructs the tree, and processes each test case.

### Conclusion

Given the provided code and the problem description, the logic of the main functions (`func_3` and `func_4`) seems correct. However, the critical part is the implementation of the `Tree` class, which is not provided. If the `Tree` class is correctly implemented to manage the tree structure and relationships, the program should work as intended.

Since the `Tree` class implementation is not provided, we cannot definitively state the correctness of the program. However, assuming the `Tree` class is correctly implemented, the logic in the provided functions is correct.

**Correctness: True** (assuming correct `Tree` class implementation)
