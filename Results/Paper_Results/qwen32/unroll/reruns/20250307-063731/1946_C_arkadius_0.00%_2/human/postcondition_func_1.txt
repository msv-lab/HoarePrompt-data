The function `func_2` evaluates a tree structure to determine the number of "good" components in the subtree rooted at a given vertex `v`. A "good" component is defined as a subtree whose size is at least `x`. The function returns a tuple containing the count of such good components and the total size of the remaining components that are smaller than `x`.
