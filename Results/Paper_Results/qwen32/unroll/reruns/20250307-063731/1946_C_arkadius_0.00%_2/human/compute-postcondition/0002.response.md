To determine the state required for the for loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The loop variable `i` is initialized to `1` and increments by `1` until it reaches `n-1`. Before the loop starts, `i` does not need to be explicitly set because the `range` function in Python will automatically start `i` at `1`.
2. **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute `n-1` times if `n` is greater than `1`. Since `n` is already given as the first integer read from the input and it is specified that `1 <= k < n`, we need to ensure that `n` is at least `2` for the loop to execute at least once.

### State Adjustment:
- `n` must be greater than `1` to ensure the loop executes.
- `i` does not need to be set before the loop starts as it is controlled by the `range` function.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, and `1 <= k < n`; `tree` is an instance of `Tree` initialized with `n`.**

This state ensures that the for loop will execute as intended.
