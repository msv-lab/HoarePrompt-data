You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

def func_2(tree: Tree, v: int, x: int) -> (int, int):

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function reads the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges `k` to be removed from the input. It constructs a tree with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges based on the subsequent input pairs. After rooting the tree, it calculates and prints the number of connected components in the tree after removing `k` edges.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given Python program correctly solves the problem, let's break down the logic and verify each function step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
The task is to find the maximum number `x` such that after removing exactly `k` edges from the tree, each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Tree Representation:**
   - The program uses a custom `Tree` class to represent the tree structure.
   - Each vertex in the tree has a list of children and keeps track of the number of good components and the remaining size.

2. **DFS Traversal:**
   - `func_1` and `func_2` perform a depth-first search (DFS) to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size for each subtree.
   - `func_1` uses an iterative approach with a stack to avoid recursion depth issues.
   - `func_2` is a recursive version of the DFS traversal.

3. **Feasibility Check:**
   - `func_3` checks if it's possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `x` vertices.
   - It uses the results from `func_1` to determine the number of good components and the remaining size.

4. **Binary Search:**
   - `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.
   - It uses `func_3` to check the feasibility of each midpoint value during the binary search.

5. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_5` reads the input, constructs the tree, roots the tree, and then calls `func_4` to find the result for each test case.

### Verification:
- The program correctly uses a binary search to find the maximum `x`.
- The DFS traversal (`func_1` and `func_2`) correctly calculates the number of good components and the remaining size for each subtree.
- The feasibility check (`func_3`) correctly determines if it's possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `x` vertices.
- The tree is correctly constructed and rooted before the binary search is performed.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It efficiently uses binary search and DFS to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.
