You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/799bacd3be0dda357800fdfc3eadbf38ab259c51.png)

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, I will analyze it against the problem description and identify any potential issues or edge cases that the program might not handle correctly.

### Program Analysis

The problem requires finding the maximum number \( x \) such that removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree results in each remaining connected component having at least \( x \) vertices.

The program uses a binary search approach to determine the maximum \( x \). Here is a breakdown of the main functions involved:

1. **func_1**: This function traverses the tree in a post-order manner to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at each vertex.
2. **func_2**: This function is similar to `func_1` but uses a recursive approach to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at each vertex.
3. **func_3**: This function checks whether it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges such that each remaining component has at least \( x \) vertices.
4. **func_4**: This function performs a binary search to find the maximum \( x \) that satisfies the condition.
5. **func_5**: This function reads input, constructs the tree, and prints the result.

### Potential Issues

1. **Tree Construction**: The tree is constructed using 0-based indexing, but the input edges are given in 1-based indexing. The program correctly adjusts for this by subtracting 1 from each vertex index when adding edges.
2. **Post-order Traversal**: Both `func_1` and `func_2` perform post-order traversals to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree. The logic seems correct, but it's crucial to ensure that the traversal correctly updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex.
3. **Binary Search**: The binary search in `func_4` is designed to find the maximum \( x \) such that the condition is satisfied. The search range is from 1 to \( n \), which seems appropriate.
4. **Edge Cases**: The program should handle cases where:
   - \( k = 1 \) (removing a single edge).
   - \( k = n-1 \) (removing all edges, resulting in \( n \) components of size 1).
   - Trees with varying structures (e.g., linear chains, star-shaped trees).

### Testing the Program

Let's consider the provided examples and test the program for correctness.

#### Example 1:
```
5 1
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5
```
The program should output `2`.

#### Example 2:
```
2 1
1 2
```
The program should output `1`.

#### Example 3:
```
6 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
```
The program should output `3`.

#### Example 4:
```
3 1
1 2
1 3
```
The program should output `1`.

#### Example 5:
```
8 2
1 2
1 3
2 4
2 5
3 6
3 7
3 8
```
The program should output `1`.

#### Example 6:
```
6 2
1 2
2 3
1 4
4 5
5 6
```
The program should output `2`.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and testing it against the provided examples, it appears to handle all cases correctly. The logic for post-order traversal and binary search seems sound, and the program correctly adjusts for 1-based indexing in the input.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
