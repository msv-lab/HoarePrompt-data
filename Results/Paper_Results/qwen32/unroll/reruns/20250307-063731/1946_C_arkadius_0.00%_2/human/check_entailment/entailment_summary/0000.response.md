### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided functions and their roles in solving the problem:

1. **TreeNode Class**:
   - Represents each vertex in the tree.
   - Contains attributes to store edges, children, subtree size, parent, good components, and remaining size.

2. **Tree Class**:
   - Represents the entire tree.
   - Methods include `add_edge` to add edges between vertices, `root_tree` to root the tree recursively, and `root_tree_non_recursive` to root the tree iteratively.

3. **Function 1 (func_1)**:
   - Uses a stack to perform a post-order traversal of the tree.
   - Updates `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex based on the minimum size `x` for connected components.
   - Returns the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at vertex `s`.

4. **Function 2 (func_2)**:
   - Recursively evaluates the subtree rooted at vertex `v`.
   - Determines the number of good components and the total size of remaining components smaller than `x`.
   - Returns these values as a tuple.

5. **Function 3 (func_3)**:
   - Uses `func_1` to determine if it's possible to remove `k` edges such that all remaining connected components have at least `x` vertices.
   - Returns `True` if the condition is met; otherwise, `False`.

6. **Function 4 (func_4)**:
   - Implements a binary search to find the maximum `x` such that `func_3` returns `True`.
   - Returns this maximum `x`.

7. **Function 5 (func_5)**:
   - Reads input values for `n` and `k`.
   - Constructs the tree and roots it.
   - Uses `func_4` to find and print the maximum `x` for the given tree and `k`.

### Analysis:
- **TreeNode and Tree Classes**: These classes are correctly implemented to represent and manipulate the tree structure.
- **Function 1 (func_1)**: This function correctly performs a post-order traversal to update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex.
- **Function 2 (func_2)**: This function correctly performs a recursive post-order traversal to determine the number of good components and the total size of remaining components smaller than `x`.
- **Function 3 (func_3)**: This function correctly checks if the conditions are met by using the results from `func_1`.
- **Function 4 (func_4)**: This function correctly implements a binary search to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition checked by `func_3`.
- **Function 5 (func_5)**: This function correctly reads input, constructs the tree, roots it, and finds the maximum `x` using `func_4`.

Given that all functions are correctly implemented and work together to solve the problem as described, the overall program is correct.

### Conclusion:
**Correctness: True**
