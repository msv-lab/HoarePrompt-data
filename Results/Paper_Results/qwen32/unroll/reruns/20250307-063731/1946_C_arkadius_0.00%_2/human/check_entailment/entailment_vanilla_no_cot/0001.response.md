Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the maximum number `x` such that after removing exactly `k` edges from a tree, all remaining connected components have at least `x` vertices.

### Program Analysis

The program consists of five functions and a main function (`func_5`) that orchestrates the process:

1. **func_1**: This function performs a post-order traversal of the tree to calculate the number of "good components" and the remaining size of each subtree. A "good component" is a subtree with at least `x` vertices.
2. **func_2**: This function also performs a post-order traversal to calculate the number of "good components" and the remaining size of each subtree. It is redundant with `func_1` and is not used in the main function.
3. **func_3**: This function checks if it's possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that all remaining connected components have at least `x` vertices. It uses `func_1` for this purpose.
4. **func_4**: This function performs a binary search to find the maximum possible value of `x` by repeatedly checking the feasibility using `func_3`.
5. **func_5**: This function reads input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to find and print the maximum `x`.

### Key Points

- **Tree Construction**: The tree is constructed from the input edges. The `Tree` class (not shown in the provided code) should handle adding edges and rooting the tree.
- **Post-order Traversal**: Both `func_1` and `func_2` perform post-order traversals to calculate the size of each subtree and the number of good components.
- **Binary Search**: `func_4` uses binary search to efficiently find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles the case where `k = 1` and `n` is small, ensuring it can find the correct `x`.

### Issues and Corrections

1. **Redundant Function**: `func_2` is not used and can be removed.
2. **Tree Class**: The `Tree` class is not defined in the provided code, but it should correctly handle tree operations.
3. **Edge Indexing**: The program converts 1-based indices to 0-based indices, which is correct for Python's 0-based indexing.
4. **Binary Search**: The binary search in `func_4` is correctly implemented to find the maximum `x`.

### Conclusion

The program is logically correct and should work as intended based on the provided problem description and input constraints. The redundant function `func_2` can be removed, but it does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
