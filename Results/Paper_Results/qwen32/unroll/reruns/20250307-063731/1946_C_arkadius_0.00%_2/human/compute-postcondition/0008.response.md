Functionality: **The function `func_3` accepts a parameter `tree` representing a tree structure with `n` vertices, an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree, an integer `k` representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, and an integer `x` representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing `k` edges. The function returns `True` if it is possible to remove `k` edges such that all remaining connected components have at least `x` vertices; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
