To determine if the given Python program correctly solves the problem, let's break down the logic and verify each function step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
The task is to find the maximum number `x` such that after removing exactly `k` edges from the tree, each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Tree Representation:**
   - The program uses a custom `Tree` class to represent the tree structure.
   - Each vertex in the tree has a list of children and keeps track of the number of good components and the remaining size.

2. **DFS Traversal:**
   - `func_1` and `func_2` perform a depth-first search (DFS) to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size for each subtree.
   - `func_1` uses an iterative approach with a stack to avoid recursion depth issues.
   - `func_2` is a recursive version of the DFS traversal.

3. **Feasibility Check:**
   - `func_3` checks if it's possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `x` vertices.
   - It uses the results from `func_1` to determine the number of good components and the remaining size.

4. **Binary Search:**
   - `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.
   - It uses `func_3` to check the feasibility of each midpoint value during the binary search.

5. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_5` reads the input, constructs the tree, roots the tree, and then calls `func_4` to find the result for each test case.

### Verification:
- The program correctly uses a binary search to find the maximum `x`.
- The DFS traversal (`func_1` and `func_2`) correctly calculates the number of good components and the remaining size for each subtree.
- The feasibility check (`func_3`) correctly determines if it's possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `x` vertices.
- The tree is correctly constructed and rooted before the binary search is performed.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It efficiently uses binary search and DFS to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.

Correctness: **True**
