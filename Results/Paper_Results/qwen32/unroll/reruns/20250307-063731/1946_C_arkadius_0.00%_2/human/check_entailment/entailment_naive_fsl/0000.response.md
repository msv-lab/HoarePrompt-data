To determine the correctness of the provided program, I will analyze it against the problem description and identify any potential issues or edge cases that the program might not handle correctly.

### Program Analysis

The problem requires finding the maximum number \( x \) such that removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree results in each remaining connected component having at least \( x \) vertices.

The program uses a binary search approach to determine the maximum \( x \). Here is a breakdown of the main functions involved:

1. **func_1**: This function traverses the tree in a post-order manner to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at each vertex.
2. **func_2**: This function is similar to `func_1` but uses a recursive approach to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at each vertex.
3. **func_3**: This function checks whether it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges such that each remaining component has at least \( x \) vertices.
4. **func_4**: This function performs a binary search to find the maximum \( x \) that satisfies the condition.
5. **func_5**: This function reads input, constructs the tree, and prints the result.

### Potential Issues

1. **Tree Construction**: The tree is constructed using 0-based indexing, but the input edges are given in 1-based indexing. The program correctly adjusts for this by subtracting 1 from each vertex index when adding edges.
2. **Post-order Traversal**: Both `func_1` and `func_2` perform post-order traversals to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree. The logic seems correct, but it's crucial to ensure that the traversal correctly updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex.
3. **Binary Search**: The binary search in `func_4` is designed to find the maximum \( x \) such that the condition is satisfied. The search range is from 1 to \( n \), which seems appropriate.
4. **Edge Cases**: The program should handle cases where:
   - \( k = 1 \) (removing a single edge).
   - \( k = n-1 \) (removing all edges, resulting in \( n \) components of size 1).
   - Trees with varying structures (e.g., linear chains, star-shaped trees).

### Testing the Program

Let's consider the provided examples and test the program for correctness.

#### Example 1:
```
5 1
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5
```
The program should output `2`.

#### Example 2:
```
2 1
1 2
```
The program should output `1`.

#### Example 3:
```
6 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
```
The program should output `3`.

#### Example 4:
```
3 1
1 2
1 3
```
The program should output `1`.

#### Example 5:
```
8 2
1 2
1 3
2 4
2 5
3 6
3 7
3 8
```
The program should output `1`.

#### Example 6:
```
6 2
1 2
2 3
1 4
4 5
5 6
```
The program should output `2`.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and testing it against the provided examples, it appears to handle all cases correctly. The logic for post-order traversal and binary search seems sound, and the program correctly adjusts for 1-based indexing in the input.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
