Functionality: **The function reads the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges `k` to be removed from the input. It constructs a tree with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges based on the subsequent input pairs. After rooting the tree, it calculates and prints the number of connected components in the tree after removing `k` edges.**
