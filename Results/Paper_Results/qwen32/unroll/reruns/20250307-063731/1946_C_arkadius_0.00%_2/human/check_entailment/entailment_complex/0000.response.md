### Reasoning:

Let's break down the functions and their roles to verify if the program meets the problem description:

1. **TreeNode Class**:
   - Represents each node in the tree with attributes like edges, children, subtree size, parent, good components, and remaining size.
   
2. **Tree Class**:
   - Represents the entire tree with methods to add edges and root the tree.
   - `add_edge`: Adds an undirected edge between two vertices.
   - `root_tree_non_recursive`: Roots the tree at a given vertex using a non-recursive approach, which is crucial for handling large trees without hitting recursion limits.

3. **func_1**:
   - Performs a post-order traversal of the tree to compute the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each node.
   - `good_components`: Counts the number of subtrees whose size is at least `x`.
   - `remaining_size`: Sums up the sizes of subtrees whose size is less than `x`.

4. **func_2**:
   - Recursively computes the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each subtree rooted at a given vertex.
   - This function is redundant in the context of the program since `func_1` already performs the same task iteratively.

5. **func_3**:
   - Checks if it is possible to remove `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.
   - Uses the results from `func_1` to determine if the condition is met.

6. **func_4**:
   - Implements a binary search to find the maximum value `x` such that `func_3` returns `True`.
   - Searches between `1` and `n` to find the largest `x` that satisfies the condition.

7. **func_5**:
   - Reads input for each test case, constructs the tree, roots it, and then calculates the desired result using `func_4`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly constructs the tree and roots it.
- `func_1` performs a post-order traversal to compute the necessary values for each node.
- `func_3` uses these values to determine if it is possible to remove `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `x` vertices.
- `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum possible `x`.
- The program handles multiple test cases and outputs the correct results for each.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. There are no logical errors or issues that would cause incorrect results.

**Correctness: True**
