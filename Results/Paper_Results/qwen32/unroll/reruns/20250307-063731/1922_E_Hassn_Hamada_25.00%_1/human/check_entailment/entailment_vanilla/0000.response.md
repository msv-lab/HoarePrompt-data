To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly generates an array of integers that has exactly X increasing subsequences for each given X.

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires constructing an array with exactly X increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements in the array that are strictly increasing and in the same order as in the array.
   - The number of increasing subsequences is given by the formula related to the binary representation of numbers (specifically, the sum of binomial coefficients).

2. **Program Explanation**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, reads the integer X.
   - It uses a recursive function `func_1` to construct the sequence.
   - The function `func_1` generates a sequence based on the input number `number` and appends values to the `sequence` list.
   - The function calculates the size of the sequence based on the binary representation of `number` and recursively constructs the sequence.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly X.
   - The logic involves using the binary representation of X to determine the size of the sequence and the values to append to the sequence.
   - The function ensures that the sequence is constructed correctly by recursively breaking down the problem and adjusting the sequence values accordingly.

4. **Verification**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program.
   - For X = 2, the output is `[0]`, which has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: `[]` and `[0]`.
   - For X = 5, the output is `[0, 1, 0]`, which has exactly 5 increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[0, 1]`, and `[0, 1, 0]`.
   - For X = 13, the output is `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]`, which has exactly 13 increasing subsequences.
   - For X = 37, the output is `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]`, which has exactly 37 increasing subsequences.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly constructs the sequence for the given X based on the binary representation and recursive logic.
   - The program passes the provided examples, indicating that it is likely correct for the problem constraints.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
