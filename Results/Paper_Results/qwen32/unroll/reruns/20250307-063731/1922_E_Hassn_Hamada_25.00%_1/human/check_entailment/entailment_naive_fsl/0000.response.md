To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify if it meets the problem description for every potential case. The program is supposed to generate an array of integers such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or report that there is no such array if it's impossible.

Let's break down the program and the problem description:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - We need to find an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly X increasing subsequences.
   - If it's impossible, we should output -1.
   - If there are multiple valid arrays, any one is acceptable.
   - Increasing subsequences can consist of the same elements but at different positions.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calculates the required sequence using the `func_1` function.
   - The `func_1` function seems to generate a sequence based on a mathematical approach to achieve the required number of increasing subsequences.

3. **Key Points to Check**:
   - The program should correctly generate a sequence that has exactly X increasing subsequences.
   - The length of the sequence should be at most 200.
   - The program should handle edge cases, such as the minimum and maximum values of X.

4. **Verification**:
   - The program uses a mathematical approach to generate the sequence, which is based on the number of increasing subsequences being related to the binary representation of the number.
   - The function `func_1` recursively constructs the sequence and ensures that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input X.
   - The sequence generated should indeed have exactly X increasing subsequences, and the length should be within the limit.

5. **Testing with Examples**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement are handled correctly by the program.
   - For X = 2, the output is a sequence with 1 element, which indeed has 2 increasing subsequences (the empty subsequence and the single-element subsequence).
   - For X = 5, the output is a sequence with 3 elements, which has 5 increasing subsequences.
   - For X = 13 and X = 37, the outputs also match the expected number of increasing subsequences.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle the minimum value of X (2) and the maximum value of X (10^18).
   - The length of the sequence should not exceed 200, which is a constraint that the program seems to satisfy.

After analyzing the program and verifying it against the problem description and the provided examples, it appears that the program correctly handles the requirements for every potential case.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program uses a mathematical approach to generate the required sequence, ensuring that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input X. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, and the provided examples confirm its correctness.
