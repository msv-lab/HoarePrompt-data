You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` generates a sequence of integers based on the input number and populates the provided list `sequence`. It returns the size of the generated sequence. If the input number is 0, it returns 0. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the sequence and modifies the `sequence` list by appending and incrementing values, ultimately returning the total size of the sequence.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly generates an array of integers that has exactly X increasing subsequences for each given X.

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires constructing an array with exactly X increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements in the array that are strictly increasing and in the same order as in the array.
   - The number of increasing subsequences is given by the formula related to the binary representation of numbers (specifically, the sum of binomial coefficients).

2. **Program Explanation**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, reads the integer X.
   - It uses a recursive function `func_1` to construct the sequence.
   - The function `func_1` generates a sequence based on the input number `number` and appends values to the `sequence` list.
   - The function calculates the size of the sequence based on the binary representation of `number` and recursively constructs the sequence.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly X.
   - The logic involves using the binary representation of X to determine the size of the sequence and the values to append to the sequence.
   - The function ensures that the sequence is constructed correctly by recursively breaking down the problem and adjusting the sequence values accordingly.

4. **Verification**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program.
   - For X = 2, the output is `[0]`, which has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: `[]` and `[0]`.
   - For X = 5, the output is `[0, 1, 0]`, which has exactly 5 increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[0, 1]`, and `[0, 1, 0]`.
   - For X = 13, the output is `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]`, which has exactly 13 increasing subsequences.
   - For X = 37, the output is `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]`, which has exactly 37 increasing subsequences.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly constructs the sequence for the given X based on the binary representation and recursive logic.
   - The program passes the provided examples, indicating that it is likely correct for the problem constraints.
