### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to generate an array of integers such that the array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The program uses a recursive function `func_1` to construct the sequence.

Let's break down the approach and correctness:

1. **Base Case**:
   - If `number` (which is `X - 1` in the initial call) is `0`, it means there are no more increasing subsequences to account for, so the function returns `0`. This is correct because an empty array has exactly one increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence).

2. **Determine the Size of the Sequence**:
   - The program calculates the largest `size` such that `2^(size + 1) - 1 <= number`. This is because the number of increasing subsequences generated by a sequence of length `size` is `2^(size + 1) - 1`. This part is crucial for determining the structure of the sequence.

3. **Constructing the Sequence**:
   - The program appends integers from `0` to `size - 1` to the sequence. This forms the initial part of the sequence.
   - It then recursively calls `func_1` with the reduced number of increasing subsequences (`number - (1 << size) + 1`), which accounts for the increasing subsequences already formed by the first part of the sequence.
   - The result of the recursive call (`result`) is used to adjust the last `size` elements of the sequence by adding `result` to each of them. This step is critical for ensuring that the number of increasing subsequences matches the desired count `X`.

4. **Return the Size**:
   - The function returns the total size of the sequence, which is the sum of `size` and `result`.

### Analysis:

The logic behind the program is sound and follows the principles of constructing sequences with a specific number of increasing subsequences. The use of binary representation and recursive adjustment ensures that the program can handle the large range of `X` (up to `10^18`).

However, there are a few points to consider:
- The program does not handle the case where `X` is `1` separately. Since the problem specifies `2 <= X <= 10^18`, this is not an issue.
- The program ensures that the sequence length does not exceed `200` by carefully choosing the size and adjusting the elements.

Given the problem constraints and the provided program, the program appears to be correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
