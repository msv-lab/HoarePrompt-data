### Reasoning:

To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to verify whether it correctly generates an array with exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences for each test case, adhering to the constraints and problem requirements.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to find an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
- If it's impossible, we should output -1.
- Increasing subsequences can consist of the same elements but at different positions.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it calculates the required sequence using the `func_1` function.
- The `func_1` function recursively constructs the sequence and ensures that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input \( X \).

#### Key Points to Check:
1. **Correctness of the Mathematical Approach**:
   - The function `func_1` uses a binary representation approach to determine the sequence. Specifically, it calculates the largest integer \( \text{size} \) such that \( 2^{\text{size} + 1} - 1 \leq \text{number} \).
   - It then appends elements from 0 to \( \text{size} - 1 \) to the sequence and recursively processes the remaining number.
   - The recursive call ensures that the sequence is constructed in a way that the number of increasing subsequences matches \( X \).

2. **Verification with Examples**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement are handled correctly by the program.
   - For \( X = 2 \), the output is a sequence with 1 element, which indeed has 2 increasing subsequences (the empty subsequence and the single-element subsequence).
   - For \( X = 5 \), the output is a sequence with 3 elements, which has 5 increasing subsequences.
   - For \( X = 13 \) and \( X = 37 \), the outputs also match the expected number of increasing subsequences.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle the minimum value of \( X \) (2) and the maximum value of \( X \) (\( 10^{18} \)).
   - The length of the sequence should not exceed 200, which is a constraint that the program seems to satisfy.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations confirm the state of the program at key points, verifying that the sequence is correctly constructed and that the number of increasing subsequences matches \( X \).

### Conclusion:
The program uses a well-reasoned mathematical approach to generate the required sequence, ensuring that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input \( X \). The annotations support the correctness of this approach, and the provided examples confirm that the program works as expected.

**Final: True**
