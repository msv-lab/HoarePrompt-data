To determine the output state, let's analyze the given loop and initial state step by step.

The initial state is:
- `number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18.
- `sequence` is an empty list that will store the resulting array.
- `size` is the largest integer such that 2^(size + 1) - 1 <= number.

The loop iterates over the range of `size`, and in each iteration, it appends the loop variable `i` to the `sequence` list.

Let's break down what happens in the loop:
- The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = size - 1`.
- In each iteration, the current value of `i` is appended to the `sequence` list.

After the loop finishes, the `sequence` list will contain the integers from 0 to `size - 1`.

The `number` and `size` variables remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Output State: **number is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, sequence is a list of integers [0, 1, 2, ..., size - 1], size is the largest integer such that 2^(size + 1) - 1 <= number.**
