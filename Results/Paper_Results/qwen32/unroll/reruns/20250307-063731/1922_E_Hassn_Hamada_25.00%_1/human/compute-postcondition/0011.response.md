To determine the output state after the loop completes, we need to analyze the given code and understand how the variables change during each iteration.

### Initial State Recap:
- `number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\).
- `sequence` is a list of integers \([0, 1, 2, \ldots, \text{size} - 1]\).
- `size` is the largest integer such that \(2^{\text{size} + 1} - 1 \leq \text{number}\).
- `result` is the output of `func_1(number - (1 << \text{size}) + 1, \text{sequence})`.

### Loop Code Analysis:
```python
for i in range(size):
    assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1
    sequence[-result - i - 1] += result
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Range**: The loop runs `size` times, with `i` ranging from `0` to `size - 1`.
2. **Assertion**: The assertion `assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1` ensures that the index `-result - i - 1` is within the valid range of indices for the list `sequence`. This means `result + i + 1` should be a positive integer less than or equal to `len(sequence)`.
3. **Index Calculation**: The index used to access `sequence` is `-result - i - 1`. This index starts from the end of the list and moves backward.
4. **Modification**: During each iteration, the element at the calculated index is incremented by `result`.

### Effect on `sequence`:
- The loop modifies the elements of `sequence` starting from the end and moving backward.
- Each element at the index `-result - i - 1` is incremented by `result` for each iteration of the loop.

### Output State:
After the loop completes, the `sequence` list will have been modified such that several elements at the end of the list have been incremented by `result`.

### Final Output State:
- `number` remains unchanged.
- `sequence` will have its last `size` elements incremented by `result`.
- `size` remains unchanged.
- `result` remains unchanged.

### Human-readable Output State:
The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: the `sequence` list will have its last `size` elements incremented by `result`, while other variables remain unchanged.

### Final Format:
Output State: **`number` is unchanged, `sequence` has its last `size` elements incremented by `result`, `size` is unchanged, `result` is unchanged.**
