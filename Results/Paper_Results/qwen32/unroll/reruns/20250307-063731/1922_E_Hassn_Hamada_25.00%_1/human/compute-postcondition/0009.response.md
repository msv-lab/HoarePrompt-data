Output State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers [0, 1, 2, ..., size - 1], `size` is the largest integer such that 2^(size + 1) - 1 <= number, `result` is the output of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`**.

In simple terms, the Output State is: `number` remains the same, `sequence` remains the same list of integers [0, 1, 2, ..., size - 1], `size` remains the same, and `result` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_1` when called with the arguments `number - (1 << size) + 1` and `sequence`.
