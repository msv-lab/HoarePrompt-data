The given loop increments the `size` variable until the condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1` (which is equivalent to \(2^{(\text{size} + 1)} - 1\)) exceeds the given `number`. This essentially finds the largest `size` such that the sum of a binary number with `size + 1` ones (i.e., \(2^{(\text{size} + 1)} - 1\)) is less than or equal to `number`.

Let's break down the loop's behavior:

1. Initially, `size` is set to 1.
2. The loop continues as long as \(2^{(\text{size} + 1)} - 1 \leq \text{number}\).
3. Each iteration increments `size` by 1.

The loop stops when \(2^{(\text{size} + 1)} - 1\) becomes greater than `number`. At this point, `size` will be the largest integer such that \(2^{(\text{size} + 1)} - 1 \leq \text{number}\).

Therefore, the output state will be:

- `number` remains unchanged.
- `sequence` remains unchanged (as it is not modified in the loop).
- `size` will be the largest integer such that \(2^{(\text{size} + 1)} - 1 \leq \text{number}\).

Output State: **number is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, sequence is a list of integers that will be used to store the resulting array of length at most 200, size is the largest integer such that 2^(size + 1) - 1 <= number.**
