You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` generates a sequence of integers based on the input number and populates the provided list `sequence`. It returns the size of the generated sequence. If the input number is 0, it returns 0. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the sequence and modifies the `sequence` list by appending and incrementing values, ultimately returning the total size of the sequence.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify if it meets the problem description for every potential case. The program is supposed to generate an array of integers such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or report that there is no such array if it's impossible.

Let's break down the program and the problem description:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - We need to find an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly X increasing subsequences.
   - If it's impossible, we should output -1.
   - If there are multiple valid arrays, any one is acceptable.
   - Increasing subsequences can consist of the same elements but at different positions.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calculates the required sequence using the `func_1` function.
   - The `func_1` function seems to generate a sequence based on a mathematical approach to achieve the required number of increasing subsequences.

3. **Key Points to Check**:
   - The program should correctly generate a sequence that has exactly X increasing subsequences.
   - The length of the sequence should be at most 200.
   - The program should handle edge cases, such as the minimum and maximum values of X.

4. **Verification**:
   - The program uses a mathematical approach to generate the sequence, which is based on the number of increasing subsequences being related to the binary representation of the number.
   - The function `func_1` recursively constructs the sequence and ensures that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input X.
   - The sequence generated should indeed have exactly X increasing subsequences, and the length should be within the limit.

5. **Testing with Examples**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement are handled correctly by the program.
   - For X = 2, the output is a sequence with 1 element, which indeed has 2 increasing subsequences (the empty subsequence and the single-element subsequence).
   - For X = 5, the output is a sequence with 3 elements, which has 5 increasing subsequences.
   - For X = 13 and X = 37, the outputs also match the expected number of increasing subsequences.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle the minimum value of X (2) and the maximum value of X (10^18).
   - The length of the sequence should not exceed 200, which is a constraint that the program seems to satisfy.

After analyzing the program and verifying it against the problem description and the provided examples, it appears that the program correctly handles the requirements for every potential case.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program uses a mathematical approach to generate the required sequence, ensuring that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input X. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, and the provided examples confirm its correctness.
