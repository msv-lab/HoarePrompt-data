The provided code snippet is a function definition, but it does not include the actual implementation of the function. Therefore, based on the given information, the function `Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number` is not executed, and the `sequence` list and `number` variable remain unchanged. 

Since there is no code inside the function to modify `number` or `sequence`, the output state will be the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and `sequence` is a list of integers that will be used to store the resulting array of length at most 200.**
