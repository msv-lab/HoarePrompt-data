To determine the state adjustments needed for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to ensure that the condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number` evaluates to `True`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Expression Analysis**:
   - The expression `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is a bit manipulation that generates a number with `size + 1` bits all set to 1.
   - For example, if `size` is 1, `(1 << 1 + 1) - 1` becomes `(1 << 2) - 1` which is `4 - 1 = 3` (binary: `11`).
   - If `size` is 2, `(1 << 2 + 1) - 1` becomes `(1 << 3) - 1` which is `8 - 1 = 7` (binary: `111`).

2. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The loop will execute if `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is less than or equal to `number`.
   - Given `size` is initially 1, we need to check if `(1 << 1 + 1) - 1` (which is 3) is less than or equal to `number`.

3. **Adjustments**:
   - Since `number` is already given as an integer such that `2 <= number <= 10^18`, it is guaranteed that `number` is at least 2.
   - The value of `(1 << 1 + 1) - 1` when `size` is 1 is 3, which is greater than 2 but less than or equal to `number` (since `number` is at least 2).
   - Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the initial value of `number` or `size` for the loop to execute at least once.

Thus, the state right before the loop can remain unchanged.

**State:** **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers that will be used to store the resulting array of length at most 200, `size` is 1**
