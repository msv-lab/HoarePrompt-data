Postcondition: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and `sequence` is a list of integers that will be used to store the resulting array of length at most 200. The current value of `number` is 0.**

Note: The given if condition `(number == 0)` contradicts the precondition `2 <= number <= 10^18`. However, the task is to describe the postcondition as if the if condition is true. Thus, the postcondition reflects that `number` is 0, despite the precondition.
