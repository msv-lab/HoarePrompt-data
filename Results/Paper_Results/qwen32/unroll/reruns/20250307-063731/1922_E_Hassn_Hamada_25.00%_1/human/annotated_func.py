#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` generates a sequence of integers based on the input number and populates the provided list `sequence`. It returns the size of the generated sequence. If the input number is 0, it returns 0. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the sequence and modifies the `sequence` list by appending and incrementing values, ultimately returning the total size of the sequence.
