The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `size`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `size`. If `size` is at least 1, the loop can execute. 

To ensure the loop executes, `size` must be greater than 0. The initial value of `i` before the loop starts does not affect the execution of the loop, but it should be initialized to 0 as it is the starting index for the loop.

The states of `number`, `sequence`, and `result` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers [0, 1, 2, ..., size - 1], `size` is the largest integer such that 2^(size + 1) - 1 <= number and size must be greater than 0, `result` is the output of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence), `i` is 0**
