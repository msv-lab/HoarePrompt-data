The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `size`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `size`. If `size` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Given that `size` is defined as the largest integer such that \(2^{(\text{size} + 1)} - 1 \leq \text{number}\), and since `number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `size` must be at least 1 because \(2^{(1 + 1)} - 1 = 3\), which is greater than 2, and thus `size` must be at least 1 for any valid `number` in the given range.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `size` must be at least 1, and `i` should be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers that will be used to store the resulting array of length at most 200, `size` is the largest integer such that 2^(size + 1) - 1 <= number and size must be at least 1, `i` is 0**
