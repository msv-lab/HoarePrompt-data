The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `size`. The values of `number` and `sequence` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers that will be used to store the resulting array of length at most 200, `size` is 1.**
