You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input('')
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [1000]
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])
        a = a[::-1]
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n-1` integers. It computes and prints an array `a` of length `n` for each test case, where each element of `a` is derived from the input integers in a specific manner.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to determine if a given Python program correctly constructs an array `a` based on the given array `x` such that:
- `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9` for all `1 ≤ i ≤ n`.
- `x_i = a_i mod a_(i-1)` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`.

### Program Analysis
The provided program does not seem to correctly solve the problem. Let's break down the logic and see why:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes the array `a` with `[1000]`. This is not a valid starting point because the problem does not specify a fixed starting value and the value `1000` does not necessarily satisfy the conditions for all test cases.

2. **Building the Array `a`**:
   - The program iterates through the array `x` and constructs the array `a` by appending `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]` to `a`. This is incorrect because it does not guarantee that `a_i mod a_(i-1) = x_i` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`. The subtraction operation does not inherently satisfy the modulo condition.

3. **Reversing the Array**:
   - The program reverses the array `a` before printing it. This step is unnecessary and does not correct any issues in the construction of the array.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that `a_i mod a_(i-1) = x_i` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`. One simple way to do this is to set `a_1` to a sufficiently large number (e.g., `10^9`) and then set `a_i = a_(i-1) + x_i` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`. This guarantees that `a_i mod a_(i-1) = x_i` because `a_i` is constructed to be exactly `x_i` more than `a_(i-1)`.

### Corrected Program Example
Here is an example of a corrected program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input('')
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [10**9]  # Set a_1 to a large number
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])  # Ensure a_i mod a_(i-1) = x_i
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure that `a_i mod a_(i-1) = x_i` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`.
