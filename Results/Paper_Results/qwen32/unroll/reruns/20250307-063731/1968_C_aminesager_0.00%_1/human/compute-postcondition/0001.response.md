In the given task, the `while` loop condition is `while t:`. In Python, a non-zero integer is considered `True` in a boolean context, and a zero is considered `False`. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `t` is not zero.

Given that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10,000, it is already in a state that satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. There is no need to adjust `t` because any value within the specified range (1 to 10,000) will ensure that the loop can execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10,000**
