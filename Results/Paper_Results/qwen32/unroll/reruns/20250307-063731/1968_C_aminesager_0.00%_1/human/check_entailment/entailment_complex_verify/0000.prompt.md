You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input('')
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [1000]
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])
        a = a[::-1]
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the number of elements in the array a. The second line contains n-1 integers x_2, x_3, ..., x_n (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500) representing the elements of the array x. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        line = input('')
        
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        
        a = [1000]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])
        
        a = a[::-1]
        
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        
        print(result)
        
    #State: t is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n-1` integers. It computes and prints an array `a` of length `n` for each test case, where each element of `a` is derived from the input integers in a specific manner.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly generate the array \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) that satisfies the condition \( x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \). Let's analyze the program and identify the issues:

1. **Initialization of `a`**: The array `a` is initialized with a single element `[1000]`. This is not a valid starting point because the problem requires `a` to have `n` elements, where `n` is the number of elements in the input array plus one.

2. **Generating the array `a`**: The program attempts to generate the array `a` by iterating from the second element to the last and setting `a[i] = a[i-1] - T[i-1]`. This logic is incorrect for two reasons:
   - The subtraction operation does not guarantee that `a[i]` will be greater than or equal to `T[i]`, which is necessary for the modulo operation to produce `T[i]`.
   - The subtraction operation does not ensure that `a[i]` remains within the required range \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \).

3. **Reversing the array `a`**: The program reverses the array `a` before printing, which does not make sense in the context of the problem. The array should be constructed in the correct order from the start.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to construct the array `a` in such a way that the modulo condition is satisfied. Here's a possible way to do it:

1. Start with an arbitrary value for `a_1` that is greater than all `x_i` (e.g., \( 10^{10} \)).
2. For each subsequent element, set `a_i` to `a_{i-1} + x_i`.

This ensures that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` because `x_i` is the remainder when `a_i` is divided by `a_{i-1}`. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        T = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [10**10]  # Start with a large number
        for x in T:
            a.append(a[-1] + x)
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
