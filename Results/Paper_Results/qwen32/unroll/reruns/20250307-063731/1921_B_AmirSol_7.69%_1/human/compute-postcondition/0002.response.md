To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `i < n` is satisfied right before the loop starts. Let's analyze the given state:

- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5.
- `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters.
- `counter` is 0.
- `i` is 0.

The loop condition is `i < n`. Given that `i` is 0, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. However, the problem statement already specifies that `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, which means `n` is guaranteed to be greater than 0.

Since `i` is 0 and `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1, the condition `i < n` is already satisfied. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `counter` is 0, `i` is 0**
