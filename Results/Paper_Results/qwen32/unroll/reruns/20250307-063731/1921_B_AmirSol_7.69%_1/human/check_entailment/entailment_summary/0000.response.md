Reasoning:  
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by counting the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of boxes (`s1`) into the desired state (`s2`). It does this by iterating through the strings and counting differing positions, applying a special rule to potentially skip over pairs of differing positions under specific conditions.

However, the logic within the `func_1` function is flawed. The condition `if i < n - 1 and s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1] and (s1[i] != s1[i + 1])` is not correctly capturing the minimal number of operations needed to transform `s1` into `s2`. This rule does not properly account for the optimal way to move cats between boxes or to add/remove cats to achieve the desired state.

For example, consider the test case:
```
3
000
111
```
The correct answer is 3, as we need to add a cat to each box. However, the given code might not correctly account for this scenario due to the logic in the while loop.

Another example:
```
4
0101
1010
```
The correct answer is 2, as we can swap the cats between the boxes. The given code might not correctly account for this scenario either.

The correct approach would involve counting the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, and then determining the number of mismatches that need to be corrected by either moving cats or adding/removing cats.

Correctness: **False**
