You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In order to test the hypothesis about the cats, the scientists must arrange
the cats in the boxes in a specific way. Of course, they would like to test
the hypothesis and publish a sensational article as quickly as possible,
because they are too engrossed in the next hypothesis about the phone's
battery charge.

Scientists have n boxes in which cats may or may not sit. Let the current
state of the boxes be denoted by the sequence b_1, \dots, b_n : b_i = 1 if
there is a cat in box number i , and b_i = 0 otherwise.

Fortunately, the unlimited production of cats has already been established, so
in one day, the scientists can perform one of the following operations:

  * Take a new cat and place it in a box (for some i such that b_i = 0 , assign b_i = 1 ). 
  * Remove a cat from a box and send it into retirement (for some i such that b_i = 1 , assign b_i = 0 ). 
  * Move a cat from one box to another (for some i, j such that b_i = 1, b_j = 0 , assign b_i = 0, b_j = 1 ). 

It has also been found that some boxes were immediately filled with cats.
Therefore, the scientists know the initial position of the cats in the boxes
s_1, \dots, s_n and the desired position f_1, \dots, f_n .

Due to the large amount of paperwork, the scientists do not have time to solve
this problem. Help them for the sake of science and indicate the minimum
number of days required to test the hypothesis.

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of boxes.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

The third line of each test case contains a string f of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the minimum
number of operations required to obtain the desired position from the initial
position. It can be shown that a solution always exists.

Note

In the first test case, you can first move the cat from the first box to the
fifth, and then remove the cat from the fourth box.

In the second test case, there is nothing to do — the only cat is already
sitting in the correct box.

In the third test case of input data, it takes three days to place a cat in
each box.

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s1 = input()

    while i < n:
        if s1[i] != s2[i]:
            if i < n - 1 and s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1] and (s1[i] != s1[i + 1]):

    s1 = input()
    s2 = input()
    print(func_1(n, s1, s2))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters.

    counter = 0

            i += 1
        
    #State: i = n, counter = number of differing character pairs with the special rule applied.
    return counter
    #The program returns counter which is the number of differing character pairs with the special rule applied.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s1` into the desired state `s2`. Let's analyze why:

The program uses a greedy approach where it iterates through the boxes and counts the number of mismatches. If there is a mismatch at position `i` and the next position `i+1` also has a mismatch, it assumes that a swap can fix both mismatches in one operation. However, this approach is flawed because it does not consider the optimal sequence of operations to minimize the total number of operations.

Consider the following counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
6
101001
010110
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- We need to move the cat from the first box to the second box.
- We need to move the cat from the third box to the fourth box.
- We need to move the cat from the sixth box to the fifth box.

**Program Output:**
```
4
```

**Explanation of Program Output:**
- The program will see the mismatch at position 0 and 1, and assume it can fix both with one operation (which is incorrect in this case).
- It will then see the mismatch at position 2 and 3, and assume it can fix both with one operation (which is incorrect in this case).
- Finally, it will see the mismatch at position 5 and assume it needs one operation to fix it.

The program does not correctly account for the optimal sequence of operations, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

If you need a more rigorous proof or additional test cases, feel free to ask!
