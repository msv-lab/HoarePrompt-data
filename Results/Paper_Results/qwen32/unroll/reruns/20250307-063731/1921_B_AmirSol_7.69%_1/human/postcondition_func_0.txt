The function takes an integer `n` and two binary strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` as input. It returns a count of differing character pairs between `s1` and `s2`, applying a special rule that allows skipping a pair if both characters differ and the next pair also differs and the current characters in `s1` are different from each other.
