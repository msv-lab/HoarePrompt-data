You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In order to test the hypothesis about the cats, the scientists must arrange
the cats in the boxes in a specific way. Of course, they would like to test
the hypothesis and publish a sensational article as quickly as possible,
because they are too engrossed in the next hypothesis about the phone's
battery charge.

Scientists have n boxes in which cats may or may not sit. Let the current
state of the boxes be denoted by the sequence b_1, \dots, b_n : b_i = 1 if
there is a cat in box number i , and b_i = 0 otherwise.

Fortunately, the unlimited production of cats has already been established, so
in one day, the scientists can perform one of the following operations:

  * Take a new cat and place it in a box (for some i such that b_i = 0 , assign b_i = 1 ). 
  * Remove a cat from a box and send it into retirement (for some i such that b_i = 1 , assign b_i = 0 ). 
  * Move a cat from one box to another (for some i, j such that b_i = 1, b_j = 0 , assign b_i = 0, b_j = 1 ). 

It has also been found that some boxes were immediately filled with cats.
Therefore, the scientists know the initial position of the cats in the boxes
s_1, \dots, s_n and the desired position f_1, \dots, f_n .

Due to the large amount of paperwork, the scientists do not have time to solve
this problem. Help them for the sake of science and indicate the minimum
number of days required to test the hypothesis.

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of boxes.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

The third line of each test case contains a string f of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the minimum
number of operations required to obtain the desired position from the initial
position. It can be shown that a solution always exists.

Note

In the first test case, you can first move the cat from the first box to the
fifth, and then remove the cat from the fourth box.

In the second test case, there is nothing to do — the only cat is already
sitting in the correct box.

In the third test case of input data, it takes three days to place a cat in
each box.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s1 = input()
    s2 = input()
    print(func_1(n, s1, s2))

def func_1(n: int, s1: str, s2: str) -> int:
    counter = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if s1[i] != s2[i]:
            if i < n - 1 and s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1] and (s1[i] != s1[i + 1]):
                counter += 1
                i += 2
            else:
                counter += 1
                i += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    return counter



- Function Summary: 
The function takes an integer `n` and two binary strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` as input. It returns a count of differing character pairs between `s1` and `s2`, applying a special rule that allows skipping a pair if both characters differ and the next pair also differs and the current characters in `s1` are different from each other.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the provided example.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to transform an initial configuration of cats in boxes (`s1`) to a desired configuration (`s2`). We can perform three types of operations: adding a cat, removing a cat, or moving a cat from one box to another. The objective is to find the minimum number of such operations required.

### Program Analysis
The provided program uses a function `func_1` which iterates through each box and counts the number of operations needed to transform `s1` to `s2`. The logic it uses to count the operations is as follows:
1. If the current box in `s1` and `s2` differ (`s1[i] != s2[i]`):
   - If the next box also differs (`s1[i+1] != s2[i+1]`) and the two boxes have different states (`s1[i] != s1[i+1]`), it counts it as one operation and skips the next box (`i += 2`).
   - Otherwise, it counts it as one operation and moves to the next box (`i += 1`).
2. If the current box in `s1` and `s2` are the same (`s1[i] == s2[i]`), it simply moves to the next box (`i += 1`).

### Correctness Evaluation
Let's evaluate the program with the given example:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - `s1 = "10010"`
   - `s2 = "00001"`
   - The program will count the operations as follows:
     - `i = 0`: `s1[0] != s2[0]` and `s1[1] != s2[1]` and `s1[0] != s1[1]` → count = 1, `i = 2`
     - `i = 2`: `s1[2] != s2[2]` and `s1[3] != s2[3]` and `s1[2] != s1[3]` → count = 2, `i = 4`
     - `i = 4`: `s1[4] != s2[4]` → count = 3, `i = 5`
     - However, the correct operations would be to move the cat from box 1 to box 5 (1 operation) and then remove the cat from box 4 (1 operation) → total = 2 operations.
   - The program incorrectly counts 3 operations instead of 2.

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - `s1 = "1"`
   - `s2 = "1"`
   - The program correctly counts 0 operations.

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - `s1 = "000"`
   - `s2 = "111"`
   - The program will count the operations as follows:
     - `i = 0`: `s1[0] != s2[0]` and `s1[1] != s2[1]` and `s1[0] != s1[1]` → count = 1, `i = 2`
     - `i = 2`: `s1[2] != s2[2]` → count = 2, `i = 3`
     - However, the correct operations would be to add a cat to each box (3 operations) → total = 3 operations.
   - The program correctly counts 3 operations.

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - `s1 = "0101"`
   - `s2 = "1010"`
   - The program will count the operations as follows:
     - `i = 0`: `s1[0] != s2[0]` and `s1[1] != s2[1]` and `s1[0] != s1[1]` → count = 1, `i = 2`
     - `i = 2`: `s1[2] != s2[2]` and `s1[3] != s2[3]` and `s1[2] != s1[3]` → count = 2, `i = 4`
     - The correct operations would be to move the cat from box 1 to box 0 (1 operation) and then move the cat from box 3 to box 2 (1 operation) → total = 2 operations.
   - The program correctly counts 2 operations.

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - `s1 = "100"`
   - `s2 = "101"`
   - The program will count the operations as follows:
     - `i = 0`: `s1[0] == s2[0]` → `i = 1`
     - `i = 1`: `s1[1] != s2[1]` and `s1[2] != s2[2]` and `s1[1] != s1[2]` → count = 1, `i = 3`
     - The correct operations would be to add a cat to box 2 (1 operation) → total = 1 operation.
   - The program correctly counts 1 operation.

6. **Sixth Test Case:**
   - `s1 = "10011001"`
   - `s2 = "11111110"`
   - The program will count the operations as follows:
     - `i = 0`: `s1[0] == s2[0]` → `i = 1`
     - `i = 1`: `s1[1] != s2[1]` and `s1[2] != s2[2]` and `s1[1] != s1[2]` → count = 1, `i = 3`
     - `i = 3`: `s1[3] != s2[3]` and `s1[4] != s2[4]` and `s1[3] != s1[4]` → count = 2, `i = 5`
     - `i = 5`: `s1[5] != s2[5]` and `s1[6] != s2[6]` and `s1[5] != s1[6]` → count = 3, `i = 7`
     - `i = 7`: `s1[7] != s2[7]` → count = 4, `i = 8`
     - However, the correct operations would be to move the cat from box 1 to box 1 (0 operations), move the cat from box 3 to box 2 (1 operation), move the cat from box 4 to box 3 (1 operation), move the cat from box 5 to box 4 (1 operation), and move the cat from box 7 to box 6 (1 operation) → total = 4 operations.
   - The program correctly counts 4 operations.

### Conclusion
From the analysis, it is clear that the program does not always provide the correct minimum number of operations. Specifically, it fails in the first test case where it incorrectly counts 3 operations instead of 2. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
