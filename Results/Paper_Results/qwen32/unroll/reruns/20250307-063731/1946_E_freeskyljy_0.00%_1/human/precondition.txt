Each test case consists of three integers n, m1, and m2 (1 ≤ m1, m2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively. The next line contains m1 integers p1 < p2 < ... < pm1 (1 ≤ pi ≤ n) representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order. The following line contains m2 integers s1 < s2 < ... < sm2 (1 ≤ si ≤ n) representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order. The sum of the values of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
