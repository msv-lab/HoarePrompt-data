Postcondition: **`N` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, `M1` is an integer greater than 1, `M2` is an integer greater than 1, and `L` is a list of integers obtained from the next line of input where the first element is 1 and the last element is equal to the first element of `R`. `R` is a list of integers obtained from the subsequent line of input where the first element is equal to `N`. Additionally, the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`.**
