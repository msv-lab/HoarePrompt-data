Functionality: **The function accepts three integers `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2`, representing the length of a permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively. It also accepts two lists of integers: the first list of length `m_1` contains the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, and the second list of length `m_2` contains the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order. The function checks if the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums are consistent with a valid permutation of length `n`. If they are consistent, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns 0.**
