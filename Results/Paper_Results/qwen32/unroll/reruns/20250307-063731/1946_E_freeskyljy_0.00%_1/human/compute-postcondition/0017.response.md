The `while` loop condition is `i > 1`. To ensure that the first iteration of the loop can proceed, the variable `i` must be greater than 1. 

Given the state right before the loop:
- `N` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input.
- `M1` is assigned the value of the second integer from the input and is greater than 1.
- `M2` is assigned the value of the third integer from the input.
- `L` is a list of integers obtained from the next line of input.
- `R` is a list of integers obtained from the subsequent line of input.
- The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`.
- The first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`.
- `M2` is not greater than 1, or the second element of `R` is not equal to the second-to-last element of `L`.
- `ans` is 1.
- `cur` is `M1 - 2`.
- `nums_left` is `N - 2`.
- `i` is `N - 1`.

The only variable in the loop head is `i`. To ensure the loop executes, `i` must be greater than 1. Given that `i` is `N - 1`, `N` must be greater than 2 to satisfy `i > 1`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `N` is greater than 2.

State: **`N` is greater than 2, `M1` is assigned the value of the second integer from the input and is greater than 1, `M2` is assigned the value of the third integer from the input; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the next line of input; `R` is a list of integers obtained from the subsequent line of input. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`. `M2` is not greater than 1, or the second element of `R` is not equal to the second-to-last element of `L`. `ans` is 1; `cur` is `M1 - 2`. `nums_left` is `N - 2`. `i` is `N - 1`.**
