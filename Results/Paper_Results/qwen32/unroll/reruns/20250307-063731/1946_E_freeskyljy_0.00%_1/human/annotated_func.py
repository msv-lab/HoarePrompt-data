#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of three integers n, m_1, and m_2 (1 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively. The next line contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_{m_1} (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) which are the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order. The following line contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_{m_2} (1 ≤ s_i ≤ n) which are the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order. The sum of the values of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three integers `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2`, representing the length of a permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively. It also accepts two lists of integers: the first list of length `m_1` contains the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, and the second list of length `m_2` contains the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order. The function checks if the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums are consistent with a valid permutation of length `n`. If they are consistent, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns 0.
