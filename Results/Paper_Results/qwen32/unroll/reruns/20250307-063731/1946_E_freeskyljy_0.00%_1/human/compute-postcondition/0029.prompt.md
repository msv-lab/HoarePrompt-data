You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of three integers n, m_1, and m_2 (1 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively. The next line contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_{m_1} (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) which are the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order. The following line contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_{m_2} (1 ≤ s_i ≤ n) which are the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order. The sum of the values of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #The program returns 1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three integers `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2`, representing the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively. It also accepts two lists of integers: the first list of length `m_1` contains the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, and the second list of length `m_2` contains the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order. The function returns 1 if the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums are consistent with a valid permutation of length `n`; otherwise, it returns 0.
