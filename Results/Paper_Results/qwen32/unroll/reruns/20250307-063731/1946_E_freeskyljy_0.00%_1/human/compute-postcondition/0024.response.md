To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `i < N`.

### Current State:
- `N` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input.
- `i` is `N + 1`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop will execute if `i < N`.

### Analysis:
- Right before the loop, `i` is `N + 1`.
- For the loop to execute, `i` needs to be less than `N`.

### Adjustment:
- We need to adjust `i` so that `i < N`. The simplest way to do this is to set `i` to a value less than `N`.

### Conclusion:
The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`. We need to set `i` to a value less than `N` to ensure the loop can execute.

### Adjusted State:
State: **`N` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, `M1` is assigned the value of the second integer from the input, `M2` is assigned the value of the third integer from the input, and `M2` is greater than 1. `L` is a list of integers obtained from the next line of input, `R` is a list of integers obtained from the subsequent line of input. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`. Either `M1` is not greater than 1, or the second element of `R` is not equal to the second-to-last element of `L`. If `M1` is greater than 1, `ans` is the product of all `nums_left` values from `N-2` down to 1, modulo `MOD`, except where `i` matches `L[cur]`; `i` is 1; `nums_left` is 1; `cur` is some value depending on the matches with `L[cur]`. If `M1` is not greater than 1, `ans` remains 1 and `cur` is `M1 - 2`. `nums_left` is `-1`. `cur` is 1. `i` is less than `N`**.

Since we need to specify a concrete value for `i` that is less than `N`, let's set `i` to 1 (the smallest positive integer):

State: **`N` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, `M1` is assigned the value of the second integer from the input, `M2` is assigned the value of the third integer from the input, and `M2` is greater than 1. `L` is a list of integers obtained from the next line of input, `R` is a list of integers obtained from the subsequent line of input. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`. Either `M1` is not greater than 1, or the second element of `R` is not equal to the second-to-last element of `L`. If `M1` is greater than 1, `ans` is the product of all `nums_left` values from `N-2` down to 1, modulo `MOD`, except where `i` matches `L[cur]`; `i` is 1; `nums_left` is 1; `cur` is some value depending on the matches with `L[cur]`. If `M1` is not greater than 1, `ans` remains 1 and `cur` is `M1 - 2`. `nums_left` is `-1`. `cur` is 1. `i` is 1**.
