The code snippet provided calculates the value of `nums_left` based on the initial state variables. Specifically, `nums_left` is assigned the value `N - R[0] - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input.
- `M1` is assigned the value of the second integer from the input.
- `M2` is assigned the value of the third integer from the input.
- `L` is a list of integers obtained from the next line of input.
- `R` is a list of integers obtained from the subsequent line of input.
- The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`.
- The first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`.
- Either `M1` is not greater than 1, or `M2` is not greater than 1, or the second element of `R` is not equal to the second-to-last element of `L`.
- If `M1` is greater than 1, `ans` is the product of all `nums_left` values from `N-2` down to 1, modulo `MOD`, except where `i` matches `L[cur]`; `i` is 1; `nums_left` is 1; `cur` is some value depending on the matches with `L[cur]`.
- If `M1` is not greater than 1, `ans` remains 1 and `cur` is `M1 - 2`.

The line of code `nums_left = N - R[0] - 1` modifies the value of `nums_left` based on the values of `N` and `R[0]`. Since `R[0]` is equal to `N` (as per the initial state), the expression simplifies to `N - N - 1`, which equals `-1`.

Output State: **`N` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, `M1` is assigned the value of the second integer from the input, `M2` is assigned the value of the third integer from the input; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the next line of input; `R` is a list of integers obtained from the subsequent line of input. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`. Either `M1` is not greater than 1, or `M2` is not greater than 1, or the second element of `R` is not equal to the second-to-last element of `L`. If `M1` is greater than 1, `ans` is the product of all `nums_left` values from `N-2` down to 1, modulo `MOD`, except where `i` matches `L[cur]`; `i` is 1; `nums_left` is 1; `cur` is some value depending on the matches with `L[cur]`. If `M1` is not greater than 1, `ans` remains 1 and `cur` is `M1 - 2`. `nums_left` is `-1`.**
