To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's break down the loop and how it affects the variables involved.

### Initial Conditions:
- `N` is the first integer from the input.
- `M1` is the second integer from the input.
- `M2` is the third integer from the input, and it is greater than 1.
- `L` is a list of integers from the next line of input.
- `R` is a list of integers from the subsequent line of input.
- The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`.
- The first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`.
- Either `M1` is not greater than 1, or the second element of `R` is not equal to the second-to-last element of `L`.
- If `M1` is greater than 1, `ans` is the product of all `nums_left` values from `N-2` down to 1, modulo `MOD`, except where `i` matches `L[cur]`; `i` is 1; `nums_left` is 1; `cur` is some value depending on the matches with `L[cur]`.
- If `M1` is not greater than 1, `ans` remains 1 and `cur` is `M1 - 2`. `nums_left` is `-1`. `cur` is 1. `i` is `N + 1`.

### Loop Code:
```python
while i < N:
    if i == R[cur]:
        cur += 1
    else:
        ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
    nums_left -= 1
    i += 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - If `M1 > 1`, `ans` is initialized to a product of `nums_left` values, `cur` is initialized based on matches with `L[cur]`, `i` is initialized to 1, and `nums_left` is initialized to 1.
   - If `M1 <= 1`, `ans` is initialized to 1, `cur` is initialized to `M1 - 2`, `i` is initialized to `N + 1`, and `nums_left` is initialized to -1.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs while `i < N`.
   - If `i` matches an element in `R` (specifically `R[cur]`), `cur` is incremented.
   - If `i` does not match `R[cur]`, `ans` is updated by multiplying it with `nums_left` and taking modulo `MOD`.
   - `nums_left` is decremented by 1.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Termination:**
   - The loop terminates when `i` reaches `N`.

### Output State:
- **`i`**: After the loop, `i` will be equal to `N`.
- **`cur`**: `cur` will be incremented each time `i` matches an element in `R`. The final value of `cur` depends on how many elements in `R` are matched during the loop.
- **`ans`**: `ans` will be the product of `nums_left` values, adjusted by the matches with `R[cur]`, modulo `MOD`.
- **`nums_left`**: `nums_left` will be decremented each time the loop runs, so its final value will be `1 - (N - 1) = 1 - N + 1 = 2 - N`.

### Final Output State:
- `i` will be `N`.
- `cur` will be the number of elements in `R` that were matched (this is dependent on the input and cannot be generalized without the specific input).
- `ans` will be the final product modulo `MOD`.
- `nums_left` will be `2 - N`.

Output State: **`i` is `N`, `cur` is the number of elements in `R` matched, `ans` is the final product modulo `MOD`, `nums_left` is `2 - N`.**
