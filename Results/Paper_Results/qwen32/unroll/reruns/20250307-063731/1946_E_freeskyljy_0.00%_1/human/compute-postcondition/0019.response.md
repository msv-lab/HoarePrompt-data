Postcondition: **`N` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, `M1` is assigned the value of the second integer from the input, and `M2` is assigned the value of the third integer from the input; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the next line of input; `R` is a list of integers obtained from the subsequent line of input. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`. Either `M1` is not greater than 1, or `M2` is not greater than 1, or the second element of `R` is not equal to the second-to-last element of `L`. If `M1` is greater than 1, `ans` is the product of all `nums_left` values from `N-2` down to 1, modulo `MOD`, except where `i` matches `L[cur]`; `i` is 1; `nums_left` is 1; `cur` is some value depending on the matches with `L[cur]`. If `M1` is not greater than 1, `ans` remains 1 and `cur` is `M1 - 2`.**
