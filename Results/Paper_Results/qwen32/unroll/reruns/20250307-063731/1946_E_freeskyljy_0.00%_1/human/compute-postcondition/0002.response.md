The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `R`. The other variables (`N`, `M1`, `M2`, and `L`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, `M1` is assigned the value of the second integer from the input, and `M2` is assigned the value of the third integer from the input; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the next line of input; `R` is a list of integers obtained from the subsequent line of input.**
