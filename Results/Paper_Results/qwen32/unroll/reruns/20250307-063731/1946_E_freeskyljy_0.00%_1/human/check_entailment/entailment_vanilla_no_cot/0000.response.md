Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not fully account for the constraints and properties of prefix and suffix maximums in permutations. 

Here are some specific issues:
1. The program does not correctly handle the case where there are more than one prefix and suffix maximums that overlap in a way that is not allowed.
2. The program does not correctly calculate the number of valid permutations when there are multiple prefix and suffix maximums.
3. The program does not handle the cases where the prefix and suffix maximums do not form a valid permutation structure.

For example, in the test case:
```
5 3 4
1 2 3
2 3 4 5
```
The program incorrectly returns `0`, but there are valid permutations that satisfy the conditions.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, which involves dynamic programming or combinatorial mathematics to count the number of valid permutations given the constraints on prefix and suffix maximums. The current program's logic is insufficient to handle all test cases as specified in the problem description.
