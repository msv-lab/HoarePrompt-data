The code snippet `i = L[-1] - 1` assigns the value of the last element of the list `L` minus 1 to the variable `i`. Given that the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`, we can deduce that `L[-1]` is equal to `N`. Therefore, `i` is assigned the value of `N - 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged by this code snippet.

So, the Output State is:
Output State: **`N` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, `M1` is assigned the value of the second integer from the input and is greater than 1, `M2` is assigned the value of the third integer from the input; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the next line of input; `R` is a list of integers obtained from the subsequent line of input. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`. `M2` is not greater than 1, or the second element of `R` is not equal to the second-to-last element of `L`. `ans` is 1; `cur` is `M1 - 2`. `nums_left` is `N - 2`. `i` is `N - 1`.**
