Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `N` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, `M1` is assigned the value of the second integer from the input, `M2` is assigned the value of the third integer from the input, and `M2` is greater than 1. `L` is a list of integers obtained from the next line of input, `R` is a list of integers obtained from the subsequent line of input. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`. Either `M1` is not greater than 1, or the second element of `R` is not equal to the second-to-last element of `L`. If `M1` is greater than 1, `ans` is the product of all `nums_left` values from `N-2` down to 1, modulo `MOD`, except where `i` matches `L[cur]`; `i` is 1; `nums_left` is 1; `cur` is some value depending on the matches with `L[cur]`. If `M1` is not greater than 1, `ans` remains 1 and `cur` is `M1 - 2`. `nums_left` is `-1`. `cur` is 1. `i` is `N + 1`.
Code of the loop:
while i < N:
    if i == R[cur]:
        cur += 1
    else:
        ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
    nums_left -= 1
    i += 1



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
