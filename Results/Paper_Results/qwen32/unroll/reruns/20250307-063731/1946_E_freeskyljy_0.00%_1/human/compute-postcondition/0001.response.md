The code provided reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `L`. The initial state specifies that `N`, `M1`, and `M2` have already been assigned values from the input. These initial values are not affected by the new code snippet, which introduces a new list `L`.

Output State: **`N` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, `M1` is assigned the value of the second integer from the input, and `M2` is assigned the value of the third integer from the input; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the next line of input.**
