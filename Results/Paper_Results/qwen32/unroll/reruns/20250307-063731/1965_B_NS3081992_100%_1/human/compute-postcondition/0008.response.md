To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which includes the variable `i` and the range `2, l`. The loop will execute if `l` is greater than 2 because the loop starts at 2 and continues as long as `i` is less than `l`.

Let's analyze the given state and identify the necessary adjustments:

1. **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`:** We don't have control over the values returned by `func_7()`, but we know that `k` is set to 1. This part of the state cannot be adjusted.

2. **`b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix:** This is derived from `n` and cannot be adjusted directly.

3. **`l` is the length of `b`:** This is derived from `b`, which is derived from `n`. We need to ensure that `l` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute.

4. **`k` is equal to 1:** This is already given and does not need adjustment.

5. **`n` is not equal to 2:** This is a condition that must be met, but it does not directly affect the loop execution. We need to ensure that `l` is greater than 2.

6. **`ans` is `[2, 3]`:** This is unrelated to the loop execution and does not need adjustment.

To ensure the loop executes, we need `l` to be greater than 2. Since `l` is the length of the binary string representation of `n` (without the '0b' prefix), we need `n` to be a number whose binary representation has more than 2 digits.

For example, if `n` is 5, its binary representation is '101', which has a length of 3. This would satisfy the condition `l > 2`.

Therefore, we need to adjust `n` such that its binary representation has more than 2 digits.

State: **`n` is a number whose binary representation has more than 2 digits, `k` is 1, `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b` and must be greater than 2, `ans` is `[2, 3]`**
