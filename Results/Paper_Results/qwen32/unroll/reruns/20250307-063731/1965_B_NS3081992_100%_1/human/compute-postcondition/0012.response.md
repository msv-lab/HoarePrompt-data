The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `ans`. None of the existing variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, and `bk` remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is an empty list.**
