The code snippet provided initializes a list `ans` with the values `[2, 3]`. This operation does not affect the variables `n`, `k`, `b`, or `l`. The variable `ans` is newly introduced and set to the specified list.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, and `k` is equal to 1. Additionally, `n` is not equal to 2; `ans` is `[2, 3]`.**
