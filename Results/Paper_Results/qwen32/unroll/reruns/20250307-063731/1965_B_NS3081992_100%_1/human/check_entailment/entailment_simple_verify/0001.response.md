### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the provided program by analyzing the logic in `func_14` and verifying if it meets the problem requirements.

#### Problem Recap:
1. We need to create a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
2. No subsequence of `a` should sum up to `k`.
3. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums up to `v`.

#### Code Analysis:

The function `func_14` is the core of the solution. Let's break it down and verify its correctness:

```python
def func_14():
    (n, k) = func_7()
    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)
    if k == 1:
        if n == 2:
            return '1\n2'
        ans = [2, 3]
        for i in range(2, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
    else:
        bk = bin(k)[2:]
        ans = []
        lk = len(bk)
        for i in range(lk - 1):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
        ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))
        ans.append(k + 1)
        ans.append(2 * k + 1)
        for i in range(lk, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
    return str(len(ans)) + '\n' + ' '.join(map(str, ans))
```

**Case 1:** When `k == 1`
- If `n == 2`, it returns `[2]` as the sequence.
- Otherwise, it creates a sequence starting with `[2, 3]` and then adds powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

**Case 2:** When `k != 1`
- It calculates the binary representation of `k` and `n`.
- It starts by adding powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k` minus one.
- It then adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to the sequence, which ensures that the sum of the sequence so far does not reach `k`.
- It adds `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to the sequence to cover sums greater than `k`.
- Finally, it adds powers of 2 from the length of the binary representation of `k` to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

#### Verification:

- **No Subsequence Should Sum to `k`:**
  - For `k == 1`:
    - The sequence is `[2, 3, 4, 8, ...]`, which does not include `1` or any combination that sums to `1`.
  - For `k != 1`:
    - The sequence includes `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1`, ensuring no combination sums to `k`.

- **All `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k` Should Have a Subsequence Sum:**
  - The sequence includes powers of 2 and strategically chosen numbers to ensure all sums from `1` to `n` (except `k`) can be formed.
  - For example, `k - 1 - sum(ans)` ensures that sums just below `k` can be formed.
  - Powers of 2 allow for forming a wide range of sums.

- **Sequence Size Constraint:**
  - The sequence is constructed to be of size at most 25, given the constraints.

#### Annotations and State Analysis:

The annotations provided give a clear state of the program at key points, which align with the logic described above. Here are some key points:
- For `k == 1`, the sequence is correctly formed to avoid summing to `1` and includes necessary powers of 2.
- For `k != 1`, the sequence includes strategic elements to avoid summing to `k` while covering all other sums up to `n`.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to generate the required sequence for each test case, ensuring that no subsequence sums to `k` and all other sums from `1` to `n` (except `k`) can be formed. The sequence size constraint is also respected.

**Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
