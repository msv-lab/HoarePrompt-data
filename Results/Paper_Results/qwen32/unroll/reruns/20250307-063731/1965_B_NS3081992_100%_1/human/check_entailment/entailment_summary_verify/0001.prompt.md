You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 15 : The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters. It writes the string representation of the value returned by `func_14()` to the standard output, followed by a newline character, for a number of times equal to the value returned by `func_10()`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

#### Problem Recap:
1. We need to create a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
2. No subsequence of `a` should sum up to `k`.
3. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums up to `v`.

#### Code Analysis:
The code defines 15 functions, but only `func_10`, `func_14`, and `func_15` are relevant to solving the problem.

1. **`func_10`:** Reads a single integer from the input.
2. **`func_14`:** This function seems to be the core logic for generating the sequence `a` based on the input `n` and `k`.
3. **`func_15`:** This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_14` for each test case and prints the results.

Let's break down `func_14`:

```python
def func_14():
    (n, k) = func_7()
    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)
    if k == 1:
        if n == 2:
            return '1\n2'
        ans = [2, 3]
        for i in range(2, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
    else:
        bk = bin(k)[2:]
        ans = []
        lk = len(bk)
        for i in range(lk - 1):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
        ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))
        ans.append(k + 1)
        ans.append(2 * k + 1)
        for i in range(lk, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
    return str(len(ans)) + '\n' + ' '.join(map(str, ans))
```

**Case 1:** When `k == 1`
- If `n == 2`, it returns `[2]` as the sequence.
- Otherwise, it creates a sequence starting with `[2, 3]` and then adds powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

**Case 2:** When `k != 1`
- It calculates the binary representation of `k` and `n`.
- It starts by adding powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k` minus one.
- It then adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to the sequence, which ensures that the sum of the sequence so far does not reach `k`.
- It adds `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to the sequence to cover sums greater than `k`.
- Finally, it adds powers of 2 from the length of the binary representation of `k` to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

#### Verification:

- **No Subsequence Should Sum to `k`:**
  - In the first case, the sequence is `[2, 3, 4, 8, ...]`, which does not include `1` or any combination that sums to `1`.
  - In the second case, the sequence includes `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1`, ensuring no combination sums to `k`.

- **All `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k` Should Have a Subsequence Sum:**
  - The sequence includes powers of 2 and strategically chosen numbers to ensure all sums from `1` to `n` (except `k`) can be formed.
  - For example, `k - 1 - sum(ans)` ensures that sums just below `k` can be formed.
  - Powers of 2 allow for forming a wide range of sums.

- **Sequence Size Constraint:**
  - The sequence is constructed to be of size at most 25, given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided code seems to correctly implement the logic to generate the required sequence for each test case.

**Correctness: **True**
