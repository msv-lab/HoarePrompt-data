The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `lk`, and `l`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `lk` and `l`. Specifically, the loop will execute if `lk` is less than `l`.

Given the state before the loop starts, the only variables we can adjust are `lk` and `l`. The variable `i` is initialized within the loop and does not need to be set before the loop starts. To ensure that the loop executes, we need to make sure that `lk` is less than `l`.

State: **`ans` is a list `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^{(lk-2)}, k - 2^{(lk-1)}, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]`; `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, and `lk` remain unchanged, `lk` must be less than `l`**
