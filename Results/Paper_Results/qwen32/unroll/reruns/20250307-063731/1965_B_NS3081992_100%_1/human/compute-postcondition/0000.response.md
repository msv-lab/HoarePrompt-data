In the given task, the for loop's execution depends on the return value of the function `func_10()`. The loop will execute if `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0. The loop head only involves the underscore `_` (which is a conventional throwaway variable) and the range determined by `func_10()`. Therefore, the only thing we can adjust is the return value of `func_10()`.

Since the loop body is omitted, we cannot derive any state from it. The only state we can control is the return value of `func_10()`.

Considering the loop head, the state needs to ensure that `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0**
