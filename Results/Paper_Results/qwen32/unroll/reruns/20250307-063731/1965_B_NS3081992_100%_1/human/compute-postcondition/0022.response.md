Given the initial state, we need to determine the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, and `ans` before calculating the final output of the provided code snippet.

From the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`.
- If `k` is 1, then `n` is 10, `b` is '1010', `l` is 4, and `ans` is `[2, 3, 4, 8]`.
- Otherwise, `ans` is calculated based on the formula provided.

Since `k` is specified to be 1, we can directly use the provided values:
- `n` is 10.
- `b` is '1010'.
- `l` is 4.
- `ans` is `[2, 3, 4, 8]`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
return str(len(ans)) + '\n' + ' '.join(map(str, ans))
```

Let's calculate the output:
- `len(ans)` is the length of the list `ans`, which is 4.
- `' '.join(map(str, ans))` converts each element of `ans` to a string and joins them with a space, resulting in the string `'2 3 4 8'`.

Thus, the final output is:
Output State: **4
2 3 4 8**
