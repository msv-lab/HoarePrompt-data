The code appends the value `k + 1` to the list `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the new state of `ans` will include the additional element `k + 1` at the end.

Output State: **`ans` is a list `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^{(lk-2)}, k - 2^{(lk-1)}, k + 1]`; `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, and `lk` remain unchanged.**
