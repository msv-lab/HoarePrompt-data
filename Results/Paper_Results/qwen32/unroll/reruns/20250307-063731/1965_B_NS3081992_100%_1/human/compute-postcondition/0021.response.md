Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`. If `k` is 1, then `n` is 10, `b` is '1010', `l` is 4, and `ans` is `[2, 3, 4, 8]`. Otherwise, `ans` is `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^{(lk-2)}, k - 2^{(lk-1)}, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2^{lk}, 2^{(lk+1)}, ..., 2^{(l-1)}]`.**
