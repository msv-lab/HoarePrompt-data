To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to analyze the provided code snippet:

```python
for _ in range(func_10()):
    sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')
```

The loop runs for a number of iterations determined by the return value of `func_10()`. In each iteration, it writes the string representation of the return value of `func_14()` followed by a newline character to the standard output.

Since the exact values returned by `func_10()` and `func_14()` are not provided, we can describe the output state in terms of these functions' behavior:

- `func_10()` determines the number of times the loop will execute.
- `func_14()` provides the value that will be printed in each iteration.

Therefore, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **The function writes the string representation of the value returned by `func_14()` to the standard output, followed by a newline character, for `func_10()` number of times.**
