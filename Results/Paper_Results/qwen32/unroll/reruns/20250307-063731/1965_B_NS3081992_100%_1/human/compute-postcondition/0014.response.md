To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for i in range(lk - 1):`. This means we need to ensure that `lk - 1` is greater than 0 so that the loop can execute at least once.

Let's break down the variables:
- `lk` is the length of the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.

For the loop to execute, `lk - 1` must be greater than or equal to 1, which implies that `lk` must be greater than or equal to 2. This means `k` must be a number that has at least two bits in its binary representation.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`.
- `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.
- `l` is the length of `b`.
- `k` is not equal to 1.
- `bk` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- `lk` is the length of `bk`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure `lk` is at least 2. Therefore, `k` must be a number that has at least two bits in its binary representation.

State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `k` is not equal to 1 and must have at least two bits in its binary representation, `bk` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix and must have a length of at least 2, `ans` is an empty list, `lk` is the length of `bk` and must be at least 2**.
