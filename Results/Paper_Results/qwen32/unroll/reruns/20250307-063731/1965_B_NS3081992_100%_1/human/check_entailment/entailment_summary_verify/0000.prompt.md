You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 15 : The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters. It writes the string representation of the value returned by `func_14()` to the standard output, followed by a newline character, for a number of times equal to the value returned by `func_10()`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Given two integers `n` and `k`, find a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
1. There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The program consists of several functions, but the main logic is in `func_14()` which constructs the sequence `a` based on the input values `n` and `k`.

#### Key Points:
1. **Binary Representation**:
   - The program converts `n` and `k` to their binary representations.
   - It uses these binary representations to construct the sequence `a`.

2. **Handling `k == 1`**:
   - If `k == 1`, the program constructs a sequence that excludes the sum `1` but includes all other sums from `2` to `n`.
   - The sequence starts with `[2, 3]` and then appends powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

3. **Handling `k != 1`**:
   - The program constructs a sequence that excludes the sum `k` but includes all other sums from `1` to `n`.
   - It starts with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k`.
   - It then adds specific values to ensure the sum `k` is not achievable but all other sums are.

### Correctness Evaluation:
Let's check if the program handles all edge cases and meets the problem requirements.

#### Case 1: `k == 1`
- The program correctly constructs a sequence that excludes the sum `1` but includes all other sums from `2` to `n`.
- Example: For `n = 2` and `k = 1`, the sequence `[2]` is correct.
- Example: For `n = 6` and `k = 1`, the sequence `[2, 3]` is correct.

#### Case 2: `k != 1`
- The program constructs a sequence that excludes the sum `k` but includes all other sums from `1` to `n`.
- It uses a combination of powers of 2 and specific values to ensure the sum `k` is not achievable but all other sums are.
- Example: For `n = 8` and `k = 8`, the sequence `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` is correct.
- Example: For `n = 9` and `k = 3`, the sequence `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` is correct.
- Example: For `n = 10` and `k = 7`, the sequence `[1, 2, 8, 3]` is correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided program handles the problem requirements correctly for all given examples and edge cases. It constructs sequences that meet the criteria of excluding the sum `k` while including all other sums from `1` to `n`.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly constructs sequences that meet the problem's requirements for all provided examples and edge cases. It handles both scenarios (`k == 1` and `k != 1`) appropriately.
