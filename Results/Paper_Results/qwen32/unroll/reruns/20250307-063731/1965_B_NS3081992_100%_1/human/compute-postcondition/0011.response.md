The code snippet assigns the binary string representation of `k` (without the '0b' prefix) to the variable `bk`. The values of `n` and `k` are initially the values returned by `func_7()`, `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, and `l` is the length of `b`. The condition that `k` is not equal to 1 remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, and `bk` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**
