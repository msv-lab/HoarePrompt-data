Functionality: **The function `func_14` generates and returns a string based on the values of `n` and `k` returned by `func_7()`. If `k` is 1 and `n` is 2, it returns the string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list of integers and returns a string starting with the length of the list followed by the integers in the list separated by spaces.**
