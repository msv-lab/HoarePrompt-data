d is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, k) representing the parameters for each test case, with 1 ≤ len(d) ≤ 1000, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7. processing, da, and rank are additional parameters that are not specified in the problem description and do not affect the precondition for the input values n and k.
