Output State: **`ans` is a list `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^{(lk-2)}, k - 2^{(lk-1)}, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]`; `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, and `lk` remain unchanged.**

Natural language: The list `ans` has been updated to include an additional element `2 * k + 1` at the end. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, and `lk`) retain their initial values.
