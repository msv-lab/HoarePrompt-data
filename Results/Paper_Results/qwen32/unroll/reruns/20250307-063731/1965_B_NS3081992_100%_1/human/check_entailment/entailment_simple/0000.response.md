### Reasoning:

The given problem requires constructing a sequence of non-negative integers such that no subsequence sums to a given integer \( k \), but every other integer from 1 to \( n \) (except \( k \)) can be formed by some subsequence of the sequence.

The program provided defines several utility functions for input reading and processing but the core logic for generating the sequence is contained in `func_14`. Here's a detailed analysis of `func_14`:

1. **Binary Representation**: The program converts both \( n \) and \( k \) to their binary representations. This is likely to help in constructing the sequence efficiently.

2. **Handling \( k = 1 \)**:
    - If \( k = 1 \), the program ensures that \( 1 \) cannot be formed by any subsequence. It constructs the sequence starting from 2 and includes powers of 2 until the length of the binary representation of \( n \). This ensures that all sums from 2 to \( n \) can be formed but not 1.

3. **Handling \( k \neq 1 \)**:
    - For \( k \neq 1 \), the program constructs the sequence starting with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of \( k \) minus one. It then adds \( k-1 \) minus the sum of the already added numbers to ensure \( k \) cannot be formed. It also adds \( k+1 \) and \( 2k+1 \) to the sequence. Finally, it continues adding powers of 2 from the length of the binary representation of \( k \) to that of \( n \).

4. **Output**: The function returns the size of the sequence and the sequence itself, ensuring that all conditions are met.

### Verification with Examples:

- **Example 1**: For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 2 \), the output is `1\n1`. The sequence `[1]` ensures that 1 can be formed but 2 cannot.
- **Example 2**: For \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 1 \), the output is `5\n2 3 4 5 6`. The sequence ensures that 1 cannot be formed but all other numbers from 2 to 6 can.
- **Example 3**: For \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 8 \), the output is `7\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1`. The sequence ensures that 8 cannot be formed but all other numbers from 1 to 7 can.
- **Example 4**: For \( n = 9 \) and \( k = 3 \), the output is `4\n7 1 4 1`. The sequence ensures that 3 cannot be formed but all other numbers from 1 to 9 can.
- **Example 5**: For \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 7 \), the output is `4\n1 2 8 3`. The sequence ensures that 7 cannot be formed but all other numbers from 1 to 10 can.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the sequence for each test case as per the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
