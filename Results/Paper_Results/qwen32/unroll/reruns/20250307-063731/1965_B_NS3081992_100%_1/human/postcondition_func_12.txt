The function `func_13` computes and returns a tuple `(y, x - a // b * y, g)` where `a` and `b` are integers, with `a` as the dividend and `b` as the divisor. If `b` is 0, it returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calculates values based on the Euclidean algorithm, ultimately returning the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.
