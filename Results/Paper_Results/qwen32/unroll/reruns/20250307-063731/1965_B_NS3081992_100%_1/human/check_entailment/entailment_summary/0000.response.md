### Reasoning:

The main function of the program, `func_15()`, handles multiple test cases. For each test case, it calls `func_14()`, which constructs a sequence based on the values of `n` and `k` read from the input. The goal is to create a sequence `a` that satisfies the conditions outlined in the problem statement.

Let's analyze the logic in `func_14()`:

1. **Binary Representation**: The function converts `n` and `k` to their binary representations.
2. **Handling k=1**: If `k` is 1, the function handles this as a special case:
   - If `n` is 2, the sequence is simply `[2]`.
   - Otherwise, the sequence starts with `[2, 3]` and continues with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
3. **General Case (k != 1)**:
   - The sequence starts with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k` minus one.
   - It then appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1` to the sequence.
   - Finally, it continues appending powers of 2 from the length of the binary representation of `k` up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

The constructed sequence is intended to ensure that:
- There is no subsequence summing to `k`.
- For all `1 <= v <= n` where `v != k`, there is a subsequence summing to `v`.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:
- **No Subsequence Summing to `k`**: The sequence is constructed such that no combination of its elements sums to `k`. This is achieved by carefully choosing the elements and ensuring that the specific value `k` cannot be formed.
- **Subsequences for All Other Values**: The inclusion of powers of 2 and specific values ensures that all sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed through appropriate subsequences. The powers of 2 allow for the formation of a wide range of sums through binary combinations.

### Conclusion:
The sequence generation logic in `func_14()` appears to meet the problem's requirements. The handling of multiple test cases in `func_15()` ensures that the program can process several inputs as specified.
