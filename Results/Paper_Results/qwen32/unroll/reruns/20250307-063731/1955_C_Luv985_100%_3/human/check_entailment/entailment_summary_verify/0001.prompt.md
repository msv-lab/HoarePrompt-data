You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, a long integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of pairs of elements from the list `a` that can be reduced to zero by subtracting equal values from both elements, with the total subtraction not exceeding `k`. If there is a single element left, it checks if `k` is sufficient to reduce it to zero.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the provided Python program is correct, let's analyze the logic step by step based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Initial Setup**: We have `n` ships with varying durability `a_i`. The Kraken attacks in a specific order: first, the first ship, then the last ship, and continues this pattern until all ships have sunk or the Kraken's attacks are exhausted.
2. **Attack Pattern**:
   - Each attack reduces the durability of the targeted ship by 1.
   - If a ship's durability reaches 0, it sinks and is no longer targeted.
   - The Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ships until all ships have sunk or the number of attacks is exhausted.
3. **Objective**: Determine the number of ships that sink after `k` attacks.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of ships) and `k` (number of attacks).
   - It also reads the list of ship durabilities `a`.

2. **Logic for Attacks**:
   - Two pointers `l` and `r` are used to track the first and last ships that are not yet sunk.
   - The program enters a loop that continues as long as there are ships left to attack (`l < r`) and attacks are remaining (`k > 0`).
   - Inside the loop, it calculates the minimum durability between the first and last ships (`mi`).
   - If `mi * 2` (the number of attacks needed to sink both the first and last ships completely) is less than or equal to `k`, it reduces the durability of both ships by `mi` and decrements `k` by `mi * 2`.
   - If a ship's durability reaches 0, it increments the count of sunk ships (`ans`) and moves the corresponding pointer (`l` or `r`).
   - If `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, it means the Kraken does not have enough attacks to sink both ships completely. The program then calculates how many attacks are left (`k`) and determines if the first ship will sink (`a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`). If it does, it increments the count of sunk ships (`ans`). The loop then breaks.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If `l == r`, it means there is only one ship left. The program checks if the remaining attacks (`k`) are enough to sink this ship and increments the count of sunk ships (`ans`) accordingly.

### Correctness Verification:
- The program correctly handles the alternating attack pattern.
- It efficiently reduces the number of attacks by considering the minimum durability of the first and last ships.
- It correctly updates the count of sunk ships and handles the edge case where only one ship is left.
- The program's logic aligns with the problem description and handles all specified constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
