You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Input:**
  - `t`: Number of test cases.
  - For each test case:
    - `n`: Number of ships.
    - `k`: Number of attacks by the Kraken.
    - `a`: List of integers representing the durability of each ship.
- **Output:**
  - For each test case, output the number of ships that were sunk after the Kraken's attacks.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The program iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it processes the Kraken's attacks in the specified order (first, last, first, last, etc.). It keeps track of the number of attacks (`k`) and the current durability of the ships. The program attempts to handle the attacks by reducing the durability of the first and last ships alternately until either all ships are sunk or there are no more attacks left.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Handling of `k` Attacks:**
   - The program uses a while loop to handle the attacks, but it does not correctly account for the scenario where `k` is very large compared to the sum of the durabilities of the ships. Specifically, the logic for reducing `k` by `mi * 2` and then checking if the ships are sunk is not fully correct.
   - The program incorrectly breaks the loop when `mi * 2 > k` without correctly handling the remaining attacks.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the case where `k` is zero correctly. If `k` is zero, no attacks should occur, and the number of sunk ships should be zero.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is one (only one ship). It should handle this scenario without entering the loop.

### Specific Example Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
1 10
5
```
- **Expected Output:** `1` (The ship will be sunk after 5 attacks, and the remaining 5 attacks will have no effect since the ship is already sunk.)
- **Actual Output:** The program does not correctly handle this case and might output `0` or incorrect results due to the loop breaking condition.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program does not handle all edge cases and potential scenarios correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The program fails to handle cases where `k` is larger than the total durability of the ships and does not correctly manage the loop when `k` is reduced to zero or when there is only one ship. The logic for reducing `k` and checking if ships are sunk is not fully correct, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios.
