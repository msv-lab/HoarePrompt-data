The provided code snippet is just a comment block and does not contain any executable Python code. Therefore, the execution of this "code" does not change any of the variables or the program state. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15. a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
