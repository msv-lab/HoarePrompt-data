Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15. `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `T` is assigned the value of the integer input, which represents the number of test cases. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`) remain as they were in the initial state since they are not modified by the provided code snippet.
