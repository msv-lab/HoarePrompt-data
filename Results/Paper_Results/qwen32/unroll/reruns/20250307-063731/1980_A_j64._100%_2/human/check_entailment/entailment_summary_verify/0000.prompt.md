You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    print(func_1(n, m, a))

def func_1(n, m, a):
    count = [0] * 7
    for char in a:
        count[ord(char) - ord('A')] += 1
    needed_problems = 0
    for i in range(7):
        if count[i] < m:
            needed_problems += m - count[i]
    return needed_problems



- Function Summary: 
The function calculates the total number of additional problems needed to ensure that each character from 'A' to 'G' appears at least `m` times in the given string `a`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads `n` (number of problems in the bank) and `m` (number of upcoming rounds). It also reads the string `a` which represents the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

2. **Counting Difficulties**: The `func_1` function initializes a list `count` of size 7 (representing the difficulties 'A' to 'G') to zero. It then iterates through the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in the `count` list based on the ASCII value of the character.

3. **Calculating Needed Problems**: For each difficulty level, the program checks if the count of problems for that difficulty is less than `m`. If it is, the program adds the difference (`m - count[i]`) to `needed_problems`, which is the number of additional problems needed for that difficulty level.

4. **Output**: The program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

The code handles all edge cases, such as:
- When `m` is 1, it checks if each difficulty is present at least once.
- When `m` is greater than 1, it ensures that each difficulty is present at least `m` times.
- When `n` is 0, it correctly calculates that all `m * 7` problems are needed.

Given the constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ m ≤ 5), the program efficiently computes the result within the limits. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases based on the provided problem description.
