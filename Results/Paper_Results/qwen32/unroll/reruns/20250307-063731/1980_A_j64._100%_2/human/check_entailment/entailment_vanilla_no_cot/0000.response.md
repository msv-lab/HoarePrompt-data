Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case. The issue lies in the fact that it only checks if the number of problems for each difficulty level is less than `m` and adds the difference to the total needed problems. However, it does not account for the fact that Vlad needs one problem of each difficulty level per round. Therefore, for `m` rounds, he needs `m` problems of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. 

Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a):
    count = [0] * 7
    for char in a:
        count[ord(char) - ord('A')] += 1
    needed_problems = 0
    for i in range(7):
        if count[i] < m:
            needed_problems += m - count[i]
    return needed_problems
```

This function is actually correct in terms of logic, but the overall program structure is a bit off. The function `func_1` should be defined before it is called. Here is the corrected program structure:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a):
    count = [0] * 7
    for char in a:
        count[ord(char) - ord('A')] += 1
    needed_problems = 0
    for i in range(7):
        if count[i] < m:
            needed_problems += m - count[i]
    return needed_problems

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    print(func_1(n, m, a))
```

Since the logic in `func_1` is correct and the program structure is now proper, the program should work as intended. Thus, the original logic of `func_1` was correct, but the overall program structure needed adjustment. Given the original submission structure, the response should be:

Correctness: **False**
