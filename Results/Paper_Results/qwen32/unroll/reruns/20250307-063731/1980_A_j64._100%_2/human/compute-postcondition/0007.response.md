Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the length of the string `a`), `m` (an integer representing the minimum required frequency of each character from 'A' to 'G'), and `a` (a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'). The function returns `needed_problems`, which is the total number of additional problems required to make the frequency of each character from 'A' to 'G' in the string `a` at least `m`.**
