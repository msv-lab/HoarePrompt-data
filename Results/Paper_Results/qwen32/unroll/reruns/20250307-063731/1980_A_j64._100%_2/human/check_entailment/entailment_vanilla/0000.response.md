### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Vlad needs to organize `m` rounds, each containing exactly one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
   - He currently has `n` problems, each with a specific difficulty level given by the string `a`.
   - The task is to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to meet the requirement for `m` rounds.

2. **Approach in the Provided Program:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of problems), `m` (number of rounds), and the string `a` (difficulty levels of the problems).
   - The function `func_1` is called with these parameters.
   - Inside `func_1`, an array `count` of size 7 is initialized to zero. This array will store the count of problems for each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').
   - The program then iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in the `count` array based on the difficulty level of each problem.
   - It then calculates the number of additional problems needed by iterating over the `count` array. If the count of problems for any difficulty level is less than `m`, it adds the difference (`m - count[i]`) to `needed_problems`.
   - Finally, the function returns the total number of additional problems needed.

3. **Verification Against the Example:**
   - **First Test Case (m=1, n=10, a='BGECDCBDED'):**
     - Count of problems: [0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1] (for 'A' to 'G').
     - Problems needed: 1 (for 'A') + 0 (for 'B') + 0 (for 'C') + 0 (for 'D') + 0 (for 'E') + 1 (for 'F') + 0 (for 'G') = 2.
   - **Second Test Case (m=2, n=10, a='BGECDCBDED'):**
     - Count of problems: [0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1].
     - Problems needed: 2 (for 'A') + 1 (for 'B') + 1 (for 'C') + 1 (for 'D') + 0 (for 'E') + 0 (for 'F') + 1 (for 'G') = 5.
   - **Third Test Case (m=1, n=9, a='BBCDEFFGG'):**
     - Count of problems: [0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2].
     - Problems needed: 1 (for 'A') + 0 (for 'B') + 0 (for 'C') + 0 (for 'D') + 0 (for 'E') + 0 (for 'F') + 0 (for 'G') = 1.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case as per the provided examples.

### Correctness: **True**
