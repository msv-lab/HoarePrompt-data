Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads `n` (number of problems in the bank) and `m` (number of upcoming rounds). It also reads the string `a` which represents the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

2. **Counting Difficulties**: The `func_1` function initializes a list `count` of size 7 (representing the difficulties 'A' to 'G') to zero. It then iterates through the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in the `count` list based on the ASCII value of the character.

3. **Calculating Needed Problems**: For each difficulty level, the program checks if the count of problems for that difficulty is less than `m`. If it is, the program adds the difference (`m - count[i]`) to `needed_problems`, which is the number of additional problems needed for that difficulty level.

4. **Output**: The program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

The code handles all edge cases, such as:
- When `m` is 1, it checks if each difficulty is present at least once.
- When `m` is greater than 1, it ensures that each difficulty is present at least `m` times.
- When `n` is 0, it correctly calculates that all `m * 7` problems are needed.

Given the constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ m ≤ 5), the program efficiently computes the result within the limits. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases based on the provided problem description.
