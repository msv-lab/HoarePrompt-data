### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Vlad needs to hold `m` rounds, each requiring one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
   - He has `n` problems with given difficulty levels in the string `a`.
   - The task is to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to meet the requirement for `m` rounds.

2. **Approach in the Provided Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and the string `a`.
   - The function `func_1` is called with these parameters.
   - Inside `func_1`, an array `count` of size 7 is initialized to zero to count the occurrences of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
   - The program iterates over the string `a` and updates the `count` array accordingly.
   - It then calculates the number of additional problems needed by iterating over the `count` array. If the count of problems for any difficulty level is less than `m`, it adds the difference (`m - count[i]`) to `needed_problems`.
   - Finally, the function returns the total number of additional problems needed.

3. **Verification Against the Example**:
   - **First Test Case (m=1, n=10, a='BGECDCBDED'):**
     - Count of problems: [0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1] (for 'A' to 'G').
     - Problems needed: 1 (for 'A') + 0 (for 'B') + 0 (for 'C') + 0 (for 'D') + 0 (for 'E') + 1 (for 'F') + 0 (for 'G') = 2.
   - **Second Test Case (m=2, n=10, a='BGECDCBDED'):**
     - Count of problems: [0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1].
     - Problems needed: 2 (for 'A') + 1 (for 'B') + 1 (for 'C') + 1 (for 'D') + 0 (for 'E') + 0 (for 'F') + 1 (for 'G') = 5.
   - **Third Test Case (m=1, n=9, a='BBCDEFFGG'):**
     - Count of problems: [0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2].
     - Problems needed: 1 (for 'A') + 0 (for 'B') + 0 (for 'C') + 0 (for 'D') + 0 (for 'E') + 0 (for 'F') + 0 (for 'G') = 1.

4. **Function Summary**:
   - The function correctly calculates the total number of additional problems needed to ensure that each character from 'A' to 'G' appears at least `m` times in the given string `a`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case as per the provided examples.
   - The function summary aligns with the program's behavior and the problem requirements.

### Final: **True**
