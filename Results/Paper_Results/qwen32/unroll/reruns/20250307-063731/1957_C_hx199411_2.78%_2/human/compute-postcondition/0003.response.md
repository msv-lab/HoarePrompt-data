To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to analyze the given code snippet and understand how it processes each test case.

The code performs the following steps for each test case:
1. Reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, which represent the size of the board and the number of moves made, respectively.
3. For each move, it increments `num` by 1 if the move is on the diagonal (i.e., `c == r`), otherwise, it increments `num` by 2.
4. It calculates `m` as `n - num`, which represents the number of remaining cells that need to be filled.
5. Depending on the value of `m`, it either prints 0, 1, or computes the number of ways to fill the remaining cells using dynamic programming.

The output for each test case is printed based on the value of `m` and the computed number of ways to fill the remaining cells.

Since the code processes each test case independently, the output state after all iterations will be a series of printed values, one for each test case.

Given the format constraints, we can summarize the output state as a sequence of printed values corresponding to each test case.

Let's assume the input for `t` test cases is provided, and we process each test case as described. The output state will be the concatenation of the results for each test case.

For example, if the input is:
```
2
3 1
1 1
4 2
1 1
2 2
```

The output would be:
```
2
0
```

This output corresponds to the results of the two test cases.

Thus, the output state after all executions of the loop have finished will be a series of printed values, one for each test case.

Output State: **the series of printed values for each test case, based on the input provided.**
