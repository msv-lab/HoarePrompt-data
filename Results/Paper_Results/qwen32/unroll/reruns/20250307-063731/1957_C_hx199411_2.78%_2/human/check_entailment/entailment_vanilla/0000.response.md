Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves placing rooks on an `n x n` chessboard under specific rules. The player and the computer take turns placing white and black rooks, respectively. The game ends when no more valid moves can be made. The task is to determine the number of different final configurations possible after `k` moves (both player and computer).

### Key Points

1. **Valid Moves**: No two rooks (regardless of color) can be in the same row or column.
2. **Mirroring**: After the player places a rook at `(r, c)`, the computer places a rook at `(c, r)`. If `r == c`, the computer skips its turn.
3. **Final Configurations**: Calculate the number of different configurations possible when the game ends.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the program to see if it correctly implements the solution.

1. **Initialization**:
    - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads `n` (size of the board) and `k` (number of moves already made).

2. **Processing Moves**:
    - For each move `(r, c)`, it checks if `r == c`. If true, it increments `num` by 1 (indicating a move where the computer skips its turn).
    - If `r != c`, it increments `num` by 2 (indicating a move where both the player and the computer place rooks).

3. **Remaining Slots**:
    - `m = n - num` represents the number of remaining slots that can be filled with rooks.

4. **Dynamic Programming**:
    - If `m == 0`, there are no valid configurations, so it prints `0`.
    - If `m == 1`, there is exactly one configuration, so it prints `1`.
    - For `m >= 2`, it uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of configurations:
        - `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to fill `i` remaining slots.
        - The recurrence relation is `dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2`, which accounts for placing a rook in one slot and then filling the remaining slots in different ways.

5. **Output**:
    - The program prints the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Verification

The program seems to correctly implement the solution based on the problem description. It correctly handles the mirroring rule and calculates the number of configurations using dynamic programming. The recurrence relation used in the dynamic programming step is also correct for this problem.

### Conclusion

The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the logic implemented.

Correctness: **True**
