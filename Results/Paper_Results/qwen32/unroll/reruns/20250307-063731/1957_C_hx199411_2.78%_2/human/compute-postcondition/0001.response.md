The `while` loop in the given code snippet is `while t:`. This loop will execute as long as `t` is a non-zero value. Since `t` is defined as an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, it is guaranteed to be non-zero before the loop starts. Therefore, no adjustment is needed to ensure that the loop can execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 3 * 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 <= `k` <= `n`. Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 <= `r_i`, `c_i` <= `n`. It is guaranteed that the `k` moves and the implied computer moves are valid, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
