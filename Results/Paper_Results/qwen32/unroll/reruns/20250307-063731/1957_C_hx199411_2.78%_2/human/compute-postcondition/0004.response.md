Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the size of the board, and an integer `k` representing the number of moves made. It also accepts `k` pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)` representing the coordinates of each move. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given moves, ensuring that all moves are valid and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
