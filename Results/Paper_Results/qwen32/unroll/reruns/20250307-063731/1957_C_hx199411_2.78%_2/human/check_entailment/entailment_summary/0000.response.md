### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the number of valid final configurations of a chessboard after a series of moves by a player and the computer. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played by the player.
   - It then reads the coordinates of the `k` moves.

2. **Processing Moves:**
   - It initializes a counter `num` to keep track of the number of positions that are already occupied after `k` moves.
   - For each move, if the move is on the main diagonal (i.e., `c == r`), it increments `num` by 1 because the computer skips its turn.
   - If the move is not on the main diagonal, it increments `num` by 2 because both the player and the computer place rooks.

3. **Calculating Remaining Positions:**
   - It calculates the number of remaining positions `m` on the board that are not occupied (`m = n - num`).

4. **Dynamic Programming for Configurations:**
   - If `m` is 0, there are no remaining positions, so the number of configurations is 0.
   - If `m` is 1, there is only one position left, so the number of configurations is 1.
   - For `m > 1`, it uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions. The recurrence relation used is:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
     This relation considers placing a rook in the current position and then placing the remaining rooks in the remaining positions.

5. **Output:**
   - For each test case, it prints the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Verification:

The logic aligns with the problem description. The dynamic programming approach correctly calculates the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions, considering the constraints and the mirroring behavior of the computer.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the given problem and produces the expected output based on the provided examples.
