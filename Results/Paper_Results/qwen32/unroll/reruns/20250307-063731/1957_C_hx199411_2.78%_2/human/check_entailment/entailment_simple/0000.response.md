### Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the number of different final configurations of a chessboard after a certain number of moves, given the constraints and rules provided.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the size of the chessboard) and `k` (the number of moves already made).
   - It then reads the next `k` lines, each containing the coordinates `(r_i, c_i)` of the moves.

2. **Counting Moves**:
   - The variable `num` is initialized to 0, and for each move `(c, r)`, it checks whether `c == r`.
     - If `c == r`, it means the computer skips its turn, so `num` is incremented by 1.
     - Otherwise, both the player and the computer make a move, so `num` is incremented by 2.

3. **Calculating Remaining Moves**:
   - The remaining number of moves `m` is calculated as `n - num`. This represents the number of moves that can still be made after accounting for the initial `k` moves.

4. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - If `m == 0`, there are no more moves to be made, so the number of configurations is 0.
   - If `m == 1`, there is only one move left, and the number of configurations is 1.
   - For `m > 1`, the program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
     - `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks in `i` remaining positions.
     - The base cases are `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
     - For `i >= 3`, the recurrence relation is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. This formula accounts for the different ways to place rooks in the remaining positions, considering both the player's and the computer's moves.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem based on the rules provided. It handles all edge cases, such as when there are no remaining moves (`m == 0`), when there is only one move left (`m == 1`), and when there are multiple remaining moves (`m > 1`). The dynamic programming approach ensures that the number of configurations is calculated efficiently, even for large values of `n` and `k`.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
