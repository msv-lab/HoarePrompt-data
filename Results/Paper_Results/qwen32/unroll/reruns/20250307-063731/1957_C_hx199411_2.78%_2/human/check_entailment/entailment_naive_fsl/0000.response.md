Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of different final configurations possible. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Counting Moves Incorrectly**: The program counts the number of moves (`num`) in a way that does not correctly reflect the number of positions left on the board after `k` moves. Specifically, it increments `num` by 2 when `c != r` and by 1 when `c == r`. This counting logic is flawed because it doesn't correctly account for the positions that are blocked due to the rooks placed.

2. **Dynamic Programming Logic**: The dynamic programming part of the program is attempting to calculate the number of ways to place the remaining rooks. However, the logic inside the loop:
   ```python
   dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
   ```
   is not correct for this problem. The formula does not correctly represent the number of ways to place the remaining rooks without them attacking each other.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, when `n = 1` and `k = 0`, there should be exactly 1 configuration, but the program might not handle this correctly due to the flawed logic.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
1
2 1
1 2
```
Expected Output:
```
1
```
Explanation:
- After placing the white rook at (1, 2), the black rook is placed at (2, 1).
- There is only one way to place the remaining rook at (1, 1).

However, the provided program might not correctly compute this because of the issues mentioned above.

Given these points, the program is incorrect.
