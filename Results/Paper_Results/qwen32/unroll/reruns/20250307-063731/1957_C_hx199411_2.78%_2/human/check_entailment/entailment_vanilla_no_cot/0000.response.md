Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a mistake in the calculation of the number of possible final configurations. Specifically, the dynamic programming (DP) approach used in the program is incorrect for this problem.

The problem involves placing rooks on a chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other. The chessboard is symmetric, and the number of configurations depends on how many positions are left to place rooks after k moves. The DP approach in the code does not correctly account for the constraints and the symmetry of the problem.

The DP transition formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is incorrect for this problem. The correct approach involves using combinatorial mathematics to count the number of ways to place the remaining rooks on the board.

A correct approach would involve calculating the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining positions, considering the symmetry and the constraints of the problem. This typically involves using factorials and combinations to count the number of valid configurations.

Given the complexity of the problem, a correct implementation would require a more sophisticated combinatorial approach, which is not present in the provided code. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.
