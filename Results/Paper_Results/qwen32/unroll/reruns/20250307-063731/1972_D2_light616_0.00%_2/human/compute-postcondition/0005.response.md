To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the code snippet. Here is the given initial state:

- `n`, `m`, `x` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`.
- `y` is the last value it had in the inner loop.
- `cnt` is the total count calculated.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(cnt)
```

Given the initial state, we know the following:
- `n` is some integer.
- `m` is some integer.
- `x` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`. This means `x = ceil(sqrt(n))`.
- `y` is the last value from the inner loop. However, the inner loop is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value.
- `cnt` is the total count calculated. Again, the exact calculation or the context of how `cnt` is calculated is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact numerical value.

Since the exact value of `cnt` is not provided, we can only describe it as the total count calculated based on the given conditions and loops in the program.

Therefore, the output of the `print(cnt)` statement will be the value of `cnt`, which is the total count calculated in the program.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the total count calculated in the program)**
