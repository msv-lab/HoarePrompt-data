You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

#Function 1:

    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: `n`, `m`, `x` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`, `y` is the last value it had in the inner loop, `cnt` is the total count calculated.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: cnt (where cnt is the total count calculated in the program)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):

    #State: t is the same integer value provided by the user, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for a given `n` and `m`.
   - The loop iterates over `x` and `y` such that `x * x <= n` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and then increments the count by `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.
   - However, this logic is not sufficient to cover all possible pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The provided program does not handle cases where `a` and `b` are not coprime (i.e., `gcd(a, b) != 1`). The program only considers pairs where `gcd(x, y) == 1`.
   - The program also does not iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b` within the given ranges. It only considers pairs where `x` and `y` satisfy the specific conditions in the nested loops, which is not comprehensive.

3. **Example of Incorrectness**:
   - Consider the test case `n = 2` and `m = 2`. The valid pairs are `(1, 1)` and `(2, 2)`.
     - For `(1, 1)`, `b * gcd(a, b) = 1 * gcd(1, 1) = 1` and `a + b = 1 + 1 = 2`. Since `1 % 2 != 0`, this pair does not satisfy the condition.
     - For `(2, 2)`, `b * gcd(a, b) = 2 * gcd(2, 2) = 2` and `a + b = 2 + 2 = 4`. Since `2 % 4 != 0`, this pair does not satisfy the condition.
   - However, the function `func_1` does not correctly handle this case and may not count the pairs as valid or invalid correctly.

Given these points, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases and therefore is incorrect.
