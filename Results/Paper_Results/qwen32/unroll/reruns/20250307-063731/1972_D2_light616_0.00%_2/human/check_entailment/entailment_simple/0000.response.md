### Reasoning:

The given program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. The program is designed to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

Here's a detailed analysis of the program:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is responsible for reading the number of test cases \(t\).
   - It then iterates \(t\) times, calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - The state before calling `func_2` is that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \le t \le 10^4\).
   - The state after execution is that all test cases have been processed.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads the input values \(n\) and \(m\) for a single test case.
   - It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
   - It then uses a nested loop to iterate over possible values of `x` and `y` such that \(x \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
   - Inside the inner loop, it checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If true, it increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).
   - The state before calling `func_1` is that `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\).
   - The state after execution is that the count `cnt` of valid pairs for the current test case is printed.

### Issues in the Program:

The program logic has a critical flaw. The current implementation does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\). The nested loop iterates over `x` and `y` but does not consider all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given ranges. Specifically, the loop conditions and the way `cnt` is incremented do not accurately reflect the problem's requirements. The program only checks pairs where \(a\) and \(b\) are multiples of \(x\) and \(y\) respectively, which is not sufficient to cover all valid pairs.

### Correctness:

Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case.

**Correctness: False**
