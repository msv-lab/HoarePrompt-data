In the provided for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is the number of iterations specified by the user.

Given that `t` is already described as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the loop will definitely execute as long as `t` is within this range. Therefore, no adjustment to `t` is necessary to ensure that the loop executes. 

The state before the loop starts only needs to ensure that `t` is a positive integer within the specified range.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
