### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the provided function summaries.

#### Problem Recap
The task is to determine the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the following conditions for given integers \(n\) and \(m\):
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

#### Program Analysis

#### Function `func_1()`
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `x = 1` and `cnt = 0` are initialized. `x` will iterate over possible values of `a`, and `cnt` will keep track of the number of valid pairs.
   - The function reads a pair of integers `n` and `m` from the input.

2. **Outer Loop**:
   - The outer loop runs while \(x \cdot x \leq n\). This loop iterates over possible values of `a` (denoted as `x` in the code).
   - The condition \(x \cdot x \leq n\) is intended to limit the number of iterations, but it only covers values of `a` up to \(\sqrt{n}\). This is a significant limitation because it does not consider all possible values of `a` up to `n`.

3. **Inner Loop**:
   - The inner loop runs while \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\). This loop iterates over possible values of `b` (denoted as `y` in the code).
   - The conditions \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\) are restrictive and do not cover all possible values of `b` for a given `a`. Specifically, they limit `y` based on both `n` and `m` in a way that does not ensure all pairs \((a, b)\) are checked.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - Inside the inner loop, the code checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If true, it increments the count `cnt` by the minimum of \(\frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x}\) and \(\frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y}\).
   - This logic is incorrect. The problem condition is that \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) must be a multiple of \(a + b\). The provided code does not check this condition directly. Instead, it incorrectly increments the count based on the gcd being 1 and the calculated minimum.

5. **Output**:
   - After the loops complete, the function prints the count `cnt` of valid pairs for the given `n` and `m`.

#### Function `func_2()`
- This function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly solve the problem because:
- The loops do not cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\).
- The condition check for valid pairs is incorrect.
- The logic for counting valid pairs is flawed.

### Correctness
Based on the analysis, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
