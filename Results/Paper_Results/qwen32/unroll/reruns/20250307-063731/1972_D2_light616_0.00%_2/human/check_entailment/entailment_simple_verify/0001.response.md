### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

#### Problem Recap
The task is to determine the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

#### Program Analysis

#### Function `func_1()`
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `x = 1` and `cnt = 0` are initialized. `x` will iterate over possible values of `a`, and `cnt` will keep track of the number of valid pairs.
   - The function reads a pair of integers `n` and `m` from the input.

2. **Outer Loop**:
   - The outer loop runs while \(x \cdot x \leq n\). This loop iterates over possible values of `a` (denoted as `x` in the code).
   - The condition \(x \cdot x \leq n\) is too restrictive. It only covers values of `a` up to the square root of `n`, missing many possible values of `a` up to `n`.

3. **Inner Loop**:
   - The inner loop runs while \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\). This loop iterates over possible values of `b` (denoted as `y` in the code).
   - The conditions \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\) are too restrictive. They limit the values of `y` based on both `n` and `m` in a way that does not cover all possible valid pairs.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - Inside the inner loop, the code checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If true, it increments the count `cnt` by the minimum of \(\frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x}\) and \(\frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y}\).
   - This logic does not correctly implement the problem's condition that \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\). The logic should check whether \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\) for each pair \((a, b)\).

5. **Output**:
   - After the loops complete, the function prints the count `cnt` of valid pairs for the given `n` and `m`.

#### Function `func_2()`
- This function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem because:
- The loops do not cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\).
- The condition check for valid pairs is incorrect.
- The logic for counting valid pairs is flawed.

### Correctness
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the final evaluation should be **False**.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
