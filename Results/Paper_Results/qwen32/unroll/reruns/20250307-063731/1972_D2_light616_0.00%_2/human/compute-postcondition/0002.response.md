To determine the output state, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and the function `func_1()`. Since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the provided code snippet, we can only make assumptions based on the loop structure.

The loop `for _ in range(t):` will execute `func_1()` exactly `t` times, where `t` is the initial integer value provided by the user. The variable `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use. This means that the loop simply counts down from `t` to 0, executing `func_1()` in each iteration.

Since we do not have any information about what `func_1()` does, we can only state that it will be called `t` times. The value of `t` itself does not change during the execution of the loop.

Therefore, the only variable that is affected by the loop is the implicit loop variable `_`, which is not relevant to the output state as it is not used within the loop body. The variable `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **t is the same integer value provided by the user, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.**
