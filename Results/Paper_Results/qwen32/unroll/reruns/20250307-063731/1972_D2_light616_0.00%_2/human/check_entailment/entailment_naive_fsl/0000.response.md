Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for a given `n` and `m`.
   - The loop iterates over `x` and `y` such that `x * x <= n` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and then increments the count by `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.
   - However, this logic is not sufficient to cover all possible pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The provided program does not handle cases where `a` and `b` are not coprime (i.e., `gcd(a, b) != 1`). The program only considers pairs where `gcd(x, y) == 1`.
   - The program also does not iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b` within the given ranges. It only considers pairs where `x` and `y` satisfy the specific conditions in the nested loops, which is not comprehensive.

3. **Example of Incorrectness**:
   - Consider the test case `n = 2` and `m = 2`. The valid pairs are `(1, 1)` and `(2, 2)`.
     - For `(1, 1)`, `b * gcd(a, b) = 1 * gcd(1, 1) = 1` and `a + b = 1 + 1 = 2`. Since `1 % 2 != 0`, this pair does not satisfy the condition.
     - For `(2, 2)`, `b * gcd(a, b) = 2 * gcd(2, 2) = 2` and `a + b = 2 + 2 = 4`. Since `2 % 4 != 0`, this pair does not satisfy the condition.
   - However, the function `func_1` does not correctly handle this case and may not count the pairs as valid or invalid correctly.

Given these points, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases and therefore is incorrect.
