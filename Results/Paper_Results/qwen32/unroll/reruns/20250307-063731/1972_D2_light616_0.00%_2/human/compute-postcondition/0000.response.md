The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, then assigns this integer value to the variable `t`. Since the initial state already specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, the input operation will overwrite the previous value of `t` with the new integer value provided by the user. The other preconditions remain valid as no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the user, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.**
