Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

Let's analyze the provided functions and their execution summaries.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function reads two integers `n` and `m`.
   - It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
   - It iterates through values of `x` such that \(x^2 \le n\).
   - For each `x`, it iterates through values of `y` such that \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
   - If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).
   - Finally, it prints the value of `cnt`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It calls `func_1` exactly `t` times.

The logic in `func_1` seems to be an attempt to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) by iterating through potential values of `x` and `y` and checking the condition involving the GCD. However, the logic does not correctly account for all possible pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the problem's condition. Specifically, the iteration constraints and the way `cnt` is incremented do not cover all valid pairs.

The provided execution summary for `func_1` does not indicate that it correctly implements the problem's requirements. The function does not seem to handle all cases correctly, especially when `x` and `y` are not coprime, or when the values of `a` and `b` do not fit the specific form assumed in the iteration.

Given the constraints and the problem's requirements, the provided functions do not seem to correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
