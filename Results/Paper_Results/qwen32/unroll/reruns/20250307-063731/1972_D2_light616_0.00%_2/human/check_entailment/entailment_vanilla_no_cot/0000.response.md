Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not properly count the number of valid pairs (a, b) for each test case. Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Loop Conditions**: The loops in `func_1` do not correctly cover all possible pairs (a, b). The loop for `x` only goes up to the square root of `n`, and the loop for `y` depends on the condition `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. These conditions are not sufficient to explore all pairs (a, b) within the given ranges.

2. **Incorrect Counting Logic**: The line `cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is incorrect. The intention seems to be counting pairs, but the formula does not correctly account for the number of valid pairs (a, b) satisfying the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0`.

3. **Single Function Call**: `func_2` calls `func_1` once for each test case, but `func_1` is not designed to handle multiple test cases correctly. It should be modified to process a single test case and then called for each test case in `func_2`.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) within the given ranges and check if they satisfy the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0`. A more efficient approach would involve using properties of the gcd and possibly precomputing some values, but the provided code does not implement such a solution.
