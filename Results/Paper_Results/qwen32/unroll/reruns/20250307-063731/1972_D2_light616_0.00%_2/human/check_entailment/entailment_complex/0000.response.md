### Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

Let's analyze the provided functions:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - Reads two integers `n` and `m`.
    - Initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
    - Iterates over possible values of `x` up to the square root of `n`.
    - For each `x`, iterates over possible values of `y` such that \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
    - Checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
    - If true, increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).
    - Prints the final count `cnt`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
    - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - Calls `func_1` `t` times to handle each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The function `func_1` is designed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given `n` and `m`.
- It uses a nested loop to iterate over possible values of `x` and `y`, and checks the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\).
- The condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) simplifies the problem significantly because it ensures that the pairs \((x, y)\) are coprime, which can be leveraged to count valid pairs efficiently.
- The use of the floor division to update `cnt` ensures that the count reflects the number of valid pairs within the given bounds.

### Correctness:
The provided functions seem to follow the problem description accurately. The logic for counting valid pairs and handling multiple test cases appears to be correct. The program efficiently handles the constraints and correctly implements the required logic.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program should be correct for the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
