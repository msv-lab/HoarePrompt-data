Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the dynamic programming approach used in the code does not accurately reflect the problem's requirements.

The key issue lies in the way the number of possible configurations is calculated. The code uses a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` is supposed to represent the number of ways to place `i` rooks on the board without any two rooks attacking each other. However, the formula used to compute `dp[i]` is incorrect and does not account for the constraints of the problem accurately.

Here's a breakdown of why the code is incorrect:
1. **Initialization**: The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` are correct for small values of `m`, but the recursive formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is not derived from the correct combinatorial logic for placing rooks on a chessboard.
2. **Mirroring Rule**: The code does not correctly handle the mirroring rule. When a rook is placed at `(r, c)` and `r != c`, a black rook is placed at `(c, r)`. However, the code does not ensure that these placements do not interfere with future placements.
3. **Diagonal Case**: When `r == c`, the computer skips its turn. The code correctly increments `num` by 1 in this case, but the logic for calculating the number of configurations is still flawed.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to use a different approach that accurately counts the number of valid configurations given the constraints of the problem. The dynamic programming approach used in the code does not correctly account for the mirroring rule and the constraints of placing rooks on a chessboard.

A correct solution would involve a more sophisticated combinatorial approach or a different algorithm that accurately reflects the problem's constraints.

Here is an example where the code does not work correctly:
For the input:
```
1
4 2
1 2
2 1
```
The code will output `1`, but the correct output should be `0` because the board is already fully occupied by the initial moves, and no further valid moves are possible. The code does not handle this case correctly.
