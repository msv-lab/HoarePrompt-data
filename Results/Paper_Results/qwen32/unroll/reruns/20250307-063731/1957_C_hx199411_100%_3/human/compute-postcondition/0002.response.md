To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand how the code processes each test case and what it outputs for each.

Given:
- `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each test case, we have `n` (the size of the grid) and `k` (the number of moves).
- For each move, we have `r_i` and `c_i` (the row and column of the move).

The code performs the following steps for each test case:
1. Initializes `num` to 0.
2. For each move, checks if `r_i` is equal to `c_i` (i.e., if the move is on the main diagonal).
   - If true, increments `num` by 1.
   - If false, increments `num` by 2.
3. Computes `m` as `n - num`.
4. If `m` is 0 or 1, prints 1.
5. Otherwise, computes the number of ways to arrange `m` non-attacking rooks on an `m x m` chessboard using dynamic programming and prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Let's consider a possible initial state with a few test cases to illustrate the output state:

### Example Initial State:
- `t = 3`
- Test Case 1: `n = 3`, `k = 2`, Moves: (1, 1), (2, 2)
- Test Case 2: `n = 4`, `k = 3`, Moves: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)
- Test Case 3: `n = 5`, `k = 0`

### Processing Each Test Case:
1. **Test Case 1:**
   - `n = 3`, `k = 2`
   - Moves: (1, 1), (2, 2)
   - `num = 1 + 1 = 2`
   - `m = 3 - 2 = 1`
   - Since `m = 1`, output is `1`.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - `n = 4`, `k = 3`
   - Moves: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)
   - `num = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
   - `m = 4 - 3 = 1`
   - Since `m = 1`, output is `1`.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - `n = 5`, `k = 0`
   - Moves: None
   - `num = 0`
   - `m = 5 - 0 = 5`
   - Since `m = 5`, compute the number of ways to arrange 5 non-attacking rooks on a 5x5 board using dynamic programming.

Let's compute the dynamic programming part for `m = 5`:
- Initialize `dp = [0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0]`
- For `i = 3`: `dp[3] = (dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) = (3 + 4) % (10^9 + 7) = 7`
- For `i = 4`: `dp[4] = (dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) = (7 + 18) % (10^9 + 7) = 25`
- For `i = 5`: `dp[5] = (dp[4] + 4 * dp[3] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) = (25 + 56) % (10^9 + 7) = 81`

So, the output for `m = 5` is `81`.

### Final Output:
- Test Case 1: Output is `1`
- Test Case 2: Output is `1`
- Test Case 3: Output is `81`

Output State: **1 1 81**

This means that after all the iterations of the loop, the outputs for the test cases are `1`, `1`, and `81` respectively.
