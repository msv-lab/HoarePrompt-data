You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

    90 91

Output

    3

    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves a game on an n x n chessboard where you and the computer take turns placing rooks. You start first, and the computer mirrors your move unless you place a rook on a diagonal (r = c), in which case the computer skips its turn. Given k initial moves, we need to determine the number of different final configurations possible when the game continues until no more valid moves can be made.

### Key Points:
1. **Initial Moves**: You have already played k moves, and the computer has responded where possible.
2. **Mirroring Rule**: The computer mirrors your move unless you place a rook on a diagonal.
3. **Final Configurations**: We need to count the number of different final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Strategy:
1. **Counting Moves**: For each of the k moves, if the move is on a diagonal (r = c), it doesn't create a mirrored move. Otherwise, it creates one. Thus, each non-diagonal move effectively reduces the number of available positions by 2 (one for you and one for the computer), while each diagonal move reduces it by 1.
2. **Remaining Positions**: After processing the k moves, we calculate the number of remaining positions (m) on the board where rooks can still be placed.
3. **Dynamic Programming**: We use dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining positions. The state `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks on i remaining positions.

### Dynamic Programming Transition:
- **Base Cases**: 
  - `dp[1] = 1`: One way to place a rook on a single position.
  - `dp[2] = 3`: Three ways to place rooks on two positions (two non-diagonal placements and one diagonal placement).
- **Transition**: For `i > 2`, `dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2`. This accounts for placing a rook in one of the i positions and then placing the remaining rooks in the remaining positions, considering the mirroring rule.

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the program to see if it correctly implements the above strategy:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Move Counting**: For each move, it checks if it's a diagonal move (r = c) and adjusts the count of remaining positions accordingly.
3. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: It initializes the `dp` array and sets the base cases.
4. **Dynamic Programming Calculation**: It calculates the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining positions using the transition formula.
5. **Output**: It prints the result for each test case modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the strategy and handles all edge cases as described. It efficiently calculates the number of final configurations using dynamic programming and outputs the correct results for the given examples.

Thus, the program is correct.
