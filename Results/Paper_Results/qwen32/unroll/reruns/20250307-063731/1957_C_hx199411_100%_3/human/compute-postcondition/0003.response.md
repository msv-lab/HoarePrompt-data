Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the size of a grid and an integer `k` representing the number of moves. Additionally, for each of the `k` moves, it receives integers `r_i` and `c_i` representing the row and column of a move on the grid. The function processes these inputs and returns the result for each test case.**
