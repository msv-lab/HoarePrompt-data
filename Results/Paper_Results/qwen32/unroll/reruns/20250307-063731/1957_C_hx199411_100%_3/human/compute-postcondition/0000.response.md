`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables (`n`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`) are not affected, so their initial conditions remain valid.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Additionally, for each of the `k` moves, `r_i` and `c_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
