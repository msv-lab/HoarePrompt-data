For the given task, the `while` loop condition is `while t:`. In Python, a non-zero integer is considered `True` in a boolean context, and zero is considered `False`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, the variable `t` must be a non-zero integer.

Given the state right before the `while` loop:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n
- For each of the `k` moves, `r_i` and `c_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n

The only variable in the loop head is `t`. Since `t` is already specified to be in the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, it is guaranteed to be a non-zero integer, which means the loop can certainly execute one time. Therefore, no adjustment to the state is necessary to ensure the first iteration of the loop can proceed.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Additionally, for each of the `k` moves, `r_i` and `c_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
