### Reasoning:

The given problem involves calculating the number of possible final configurations of a chessboard after a series of moves by two players, where each player places rooks such that no two rooks attack each other. The problem specifies a particular rule for the computer's move (mirroring the player's move unless the move is on the diagonal).

The provided code seems to correctly implement the logic to solve this problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the size of the board `n` and the number of moves `k` already played. It then reads `k` pairs of integers representing the positions of the rooks placed by the player.

2. **Counting Moves**: For each move, the code checks if the move is on the diagonal (i.e., `r == c`). If it is, the move is counted once (`num += 1`), because the computer skips its turn. If it's not on the diagonal, the move is counted twice (`num += 2`), because the computer places a rook in response.

3. **Calculating Remaining Positions**: After counting the moves, the code calculates the number of remaining positions `m` on the board that are not occupied by rooks.

4. **Dynamic Programming for Configurations**:
   - If there are no remaining positions (`m == 0`), there's only one configuration (the current configuration).
   - If there's only one remaining position (`m == 1`), there's also only one configuration.
   - For more than one remaining position, the code uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations. The DP array `dp` is used where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place `i` non-attacking rooks on an `i x i` board. The recurrence relation `dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2` is used, representing the two choices (either place a rook in the last row/column or not).

5. **Output**: For each test case, the code prints the number of possible configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Correctness:

The code correctly implements the logic described above, and the dynamic programming approach ensures that the solution is computed efficiently even for large board sizes. The provided example inputs and outputs match the expected results based on the problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is verified.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
