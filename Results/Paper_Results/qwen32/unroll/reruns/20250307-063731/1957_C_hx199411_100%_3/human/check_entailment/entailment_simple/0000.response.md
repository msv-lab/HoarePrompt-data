### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the number of different final configurations of a chessboard after a series of moves in a game involving white and black rooks. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played. It then reads the `k` moves.

2. **Counting Moves**: The program counts how many of the `k` moves result in the computer skipping its turn (i.e., when `r == c`). For each such move, it increments a counter `num` by 1. For all other moves, it increments `num` by 2 because each of these moves results in both a white and a black rook being placed on the board.

3. **Calculating Remaining Slots**: The variable `m` is calculated as `n - num`, representing the number of remaining slots on the board where additional rooks can be placed.

4. **Base Cases**: 
   - If `m == 0`, it means there are no more slots available, and there is only one possible configuration (the one already achieved). Hence, the program prints `1`.
   - If `m == 1`, it means there is only one slot left, and the configuration is uniquely determined (either a white or a black rook can be placed, but since it's a single slot, it's still considered one configuration). Hence, the program prints `1`.

5. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: For `m > 1`, the program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations. The `dp` array is initialized with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` (since with 2 slots, there are 3 ways to place rooks: (W,B), (B,W), and (W/W or B/B on the same slot)). The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is used to fill the `dp` array up to `dp[m]`. This relation ensures that all possible configurations are counted correctly, considering the constraints of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of different final configurations of the chessboard after the given moves. It handles all edge cases and uses an efficient dynamic programming approach for larger values of `m`.

**Correctness: True**
