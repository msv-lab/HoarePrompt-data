### Reasoning:
The provided Python program appears to be solving the problem by calculating the number of possible final configurations of rooks on an n x n chessboard after k initial moves, with the constraint that no two rooks can attack each other. The program processes each test case individually, using dynamic programming to compute the number of valid configurations.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the board size `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads `k` pairs of integers representing the positions of the rooks.

2. **Counting Moves:**
   - It counts how many moves are on the diagonal (`c == r`) and how many are off the diagonal (`c != r`).
   - For each off-diagonal move, the computer will make a mirrored move, effectively using two positions.
   - For each diagonal move, the computer skips its turn, using only one position.
   - The variable `num` keeps track of the total number of positions used after `k` moves.

3. **Calculating Remaining Positions:**
   - The remaining positions on the board are calculated as `m = n - num`.

4. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - If `m` is 0 or 1, there is only one possible configuration.
   - For larger values of `m`, the program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of valid configurations.
   - The dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized with base cases:
     - `dp[1] = 1` (one way to place a single rook).
     - `dp[2] = 3` (three ways to place two rooks on a 2x2 board without attacking each other).
   - For `m > 2`, the program iteratively computes the number of configurations using the relation:
     - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
     - This relation accounts for placing the last rook in any of the `i` positions and considering the configurations of the remaining `i-1` positions.

5. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the number of possible final configurations modulo `10^9 + 7`.

The program uses a dynamic programming approach that correctly models the problem's constraints and efficiently computes the number of valid configurations. The logic is consistent with the problem description, and the provided example output matches the expected results.
