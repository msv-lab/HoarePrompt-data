Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a logical error in the calculation of the number of different final configurations. Specifically, the dynamic programming (DP) approach used in the program does not correctly account for the number of valid configurations after the initial k moves.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Initial Moves Consideration**: The program correctly counts the number of moves where `r == c` and where `r != c` to determine `num`, which represents the number of positions already occupied by rooks after k moves and their mirrored counterparts.

2. **Remaining Positions**: The variable `m` is calculated as `n - num`, which is the number of positions left on the board that are unoccupied.

3. **DP Initialization and Transition**: The DP array `dp` is initialized with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`. The transition formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is intended to calculate the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining `m` positions. However, this formula is incorrect for this problem.

The correct way to calculate the number of valid configurations involves combinatorial mathematics, specifically the calculation of derangements (permutations where no element appears in its original position) and other combinatorial constructs, which the given DP formula does not correctly implement.

The correct approach involves calculating the number of ways to place rooks such that no two rooks attack each other and considering the symmetry introduced by the mirroring rule.

Given the complexity of the problem, a correct solution would involve more sophisticated combinatorial techniques, possibly including the use of inclusion-exclusion principles or advanced dynamic programming methods that correctly account for the constraints and symmetries of the problem.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
