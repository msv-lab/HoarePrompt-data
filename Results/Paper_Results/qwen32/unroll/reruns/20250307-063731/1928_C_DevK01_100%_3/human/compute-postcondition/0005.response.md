The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `i`. The values of `q`, `x`, and `M` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the assignment to `i`.

Output State: **`q` and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < q ≤ 10^9; `M` is a list, and if `w` (the square root of `q`) is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` contains the integer `w`. Otherwise, `M` is an empty list; `i` is 1.**
