Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of valid `k` values for given `n` and `x` as described in the problem statement. The program uses a helper function `func_1` to find divisors, but the logic to determine valid `k` values is not correctly implemented.

Let's analyze the logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.
2. It calculates `y = n + x` and checks if `y` is even. If not, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case.
3. It then calls `func_1` to find divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
4. If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it calls `func_1` again to find divisors of `(n - x) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
5. It removes duplicates from the list of divisors and prints the length of the list.

The issue is that the logic to determine valid `k` values is not correctly implemented. The program does not correctly simulate the "first-k-th" position logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, it does not correctly handle the repeating pattern of the sequence and the constraints on `k`.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
10 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Explanation:**
For `n = 10` and `x = 2`, the valid `k` values are 2, 3, 5, and 6. The program should output 4.

**Actual Output:**
The program might not output 4 for this input because the logic to determine valid `k` values is flawed.

To correctly determine the valid `k` values, the program should simulate the "first-k-th" position logic and check if the `x` value at position `n` matches the expected value for each possible `k`.

Since the program does not correctly implement this logic, it is incorrect.
