Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find the number of possible values of `k` such that the given `n` and `x` fit the described "settling" pattern.
- The pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
- For a given position `n` and number `x` received, we need to find all `k` such that the pattern holds true.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Main Loop:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.
   - It calculates `y = n + x`.
   - If `y` is odd, it prints `0` because the pattern described requires `y` to be even.
   - If `y` is even, it calls `func_1` with `(y - 2) // 2` and `x` to find possible `k` values.
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to `3 * x - 2`, it calls `func_1` again with `(n - x) // 2` and `x` to find additional possible `k` values.
   - It combines the results from both calls, removes duplicates, and prints the count of unique `k` values.

2. **Function `func_1(q, x)`:**
   - This function finds all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` and less than the integer square root of `q`.
   - It first checks if the square root of `q` is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If so, it adds it to the list `M`.
   - Then, it iterates through all integers from `1` to the integer square root of `q`. For each integer `i` that divides `q`, it checks if `i` or `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` and adds them to `M`.
   - Finally, it returns the list `M`.

### Verification:
- The program correctly identifies the conditions under which `k` values are valid.
- It uses the mathematical property of divisors to efficiently find possible `k` values.
- The combination of results from two calls to `func_1` ensures that all possible `k` values are considered.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem description accurately.

**Correctness: True**
