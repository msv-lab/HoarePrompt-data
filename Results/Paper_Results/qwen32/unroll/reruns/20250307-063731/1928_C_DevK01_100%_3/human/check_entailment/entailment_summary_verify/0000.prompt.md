You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = L[0]
    x = L[1]
    ans = 0
    y = n + x
    if y % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    else:
        L1 = func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)
        if n >= 3 * x - 2:
            L1 += func_1((n - x) // 2, x)
        L1 = list(set(L1))
        print(len(L1))
        continue

def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1:
        M += [w]
    i = 1
    while i < w:
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M += [i]
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M += [q // i]
        i += 1
    return M



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two integer parameters `q` and `x` such that 1 ≤ x < q ≤ 10^9. It returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` and less than the integer square root of `q`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of valid `k` values for given `n` and `x` as described in the problem statement. The program uses a helper function `func_1` to find divisors, but the logic to determine valid `k` values is not correctly implemented.

Let's analyze the logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.
2. It calculates `y = n + x` and checks if `y` is even. If not, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case.
3. It then calls `func_1` to find divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
4. If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it calls `func_1` again to find divisors of `(n - x) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
5. It removes duplicates from the list of divisors and prints the length of the list.

The issue is that the logic to determine valid `k` values is not correctly implemented. The program does not correctly simulate the "first-k-th" position logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, it does not correctly handle the repeating pattern of the sequence and the constraints on `k`.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
10 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Explanation:**
For `n = 10` and `x = 2`, the valid `k` values are 2, 3, 5, and 6. The program should output 4.

**Actual Output:**
The program might not output 4 for this input because the logic to determine valid `k` values is flawed.

To correctly determine the valid `k` values, the program should simulate the "first-k-th" position logic and check if the `x` value at position `n` matches the expected value for each possible `k`.

Since the program does not correctly implement this logic, it is incorrect.
