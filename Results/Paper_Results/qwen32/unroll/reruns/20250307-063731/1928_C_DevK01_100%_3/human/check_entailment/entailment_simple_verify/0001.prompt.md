You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the provided program is correct, we need to analyze its logic and compare it with the problem description and the provided examples.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires finding the number of possible values of \( k \) such that when people are lined up in a specific pattern, a person in position \( n \) receives number \( x \).

The pattern is as follows:
- The first \( k \) people get numbers \( 1, 2, ..., k \).
- The next \( k-2 \) people get numbers \( k-1, k-2, ..., 2 \).
- This pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates the number of valid \( k \) values that fit the given position \( n \) and number \( x \).

#### Key Steps in the Program:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then for each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \).
2. **Initial Check**: It checks if \( y = n + x \) is even. If not, it prints 0 because it's impossible for \( x \) to be in position \( n \) with an odd \( y \).
3. **Finding Valid \( k \) Values**:
    - It calls `func_1` to find divisors of \( \frac{y-2}{2} \) that are at least \( x-1 \).
    - If \( n \geq 3x - 2 \), it also calls `func_1` to find divisors of \( \frac{n-x}{2} \) that are at least \( x-1 \).
    - It combines the results, removes duplicates, and prints the count of unique valid \( k \) values.

#### Function `func_1`:
- It finds all divisors of a given number \( q \) that are at least \( x-1 \).
- It includes both the divisor and its complement (i.e., \( q/i \)) if they are at least \( x-1 \).

### Example Verification
Let's verify the program with the provided examples.

#### Example 1:
- Input: \( n = 10 \), \( x = 2 \)
- \( y = 12 \) (even)
- \( q_1 = \frac{12-2}{2} = 5 \)
- Divisors of 5 that are at least 1: 5
- \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) (10 >= 4), so \( q_2 = \frac{10-2}{2} = 4 \)
- Divisors of 4 that are at least 1: 1, 2, 4
- Valid \( k \) values: 2, 3, 5, 6 (from the divisors and the pattern)
- Output: 4

#### Example 2:
- Input: \( n = 3 \), \( x = 1 \)
- \( y = 4 \) (even)
- \( q_1 = \frac{4-2}{2} = 1 \)
- Divisors of 1 that are at least 0: 1
- Valid \( k \) values: 2 (from the divisors and the pattern)
- Output: 1

#### Example 3:
- Input: \( n = 76 \), \( x = 4 \)
- \( y = 80 \) (even)
- \( q_1 = \frac{80-2}{2} = 39 \)
- Divisors of 39 that are at least 3: 3, 13, 39
- \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) (76 >= 10), so \( q_2 = \frac{76-4}{2} = 36 \)
- Divisors of 36 that are at least 3: 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36
- Valid \( k \) values: 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19
- Output: 9

#### Example 4:
- Input: \( n = 100 \), \( x = 99 \)
- \( y = 199 \) (odd)
- Output: 0 (impossible)

#### Example 5:
- Input: \( n = 1000000000 \), \( x = 500000000 \)
- \( y = 1500000000 \) (even)
- \( q_1 = \frac{1500000000-2}{2} = 749999999 \)
- Divisors of 749999999 that are at least 499999999: 749999999
- \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) (1000000000 >= 1499999998), so \( q_2 = \frac{1000000000-500000000}{2} = 250000000 \)
- Divisors of 250000000 that are at least 499999999: None
- Valid \( k \) values: 500000001
- Output: 1

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid \( k \) values for each test case. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.
