Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `y`:** The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`, but it should be related to the pattern of the sequence. Specifically, the value of `k` should be such that the position `n` falls within a repeating sequence of length `2k - 2`.

2. **Logic for Determining `k`:** The logic for determining the valid values of `k` is flawed. The program uses a helper function `func_1` to find divisors of a certain value, but this does not directly correspond to the valid `k` values based on the problem description.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases:** The program does not correctly handle all edge cases, such as when `x` is 1 or when `n` is close to `x`.

4. **Output of Results:** The program outputs the length of a list of potential `k` values, but the logic to generate this list is incorrect.

To correctly solve the problem, one should determine the valid `k` values by iterating through potential `k` values and checking if they satisfy the conditions of the sequence. Specifically, for a given `k`, the position `n` should map to the number `x` according to the described pattern.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def count_valid_ks(n, x):
    count = 0
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        if (n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) < k - 1:
            if (n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) + 1 == x:
                count += 1
        else:
            if 2 * k - 1 - (n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) == x:
                count += 1
    return count

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_ks(n, x))
```

This program correctly iterates through possible values of `k`, checks if they fit the pattern, and counts how many valid `k` values there are for each test case.
