The value of `w` is assigned the square root of `q`. The values of `q` and `x` remain unchanged, and `M` is still an empty list. Therefore, the Output State is that `q` and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < q ≤ 10^9, `M` is an empty list, and `w` is the square root of `q`.

Output State: **`q` and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < q ≤ 10^9; `M` is an empty list; `w` is the square root of `q`**.
