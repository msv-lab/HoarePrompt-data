The code snippet `M += [w]` appends the value of `w` to the list `M`. Since `M` was initially an empty list, after the execution of this code, `M` will contain one element, which is `w`. The values of `q`, `x`, and `w` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < q ≤ 10^9; `M` is a list containing the integer `w`; `w` is the square root of `q`, and `w` is an integer, and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**
