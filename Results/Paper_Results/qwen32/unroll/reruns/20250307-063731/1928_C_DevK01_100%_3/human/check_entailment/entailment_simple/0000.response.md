### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the number of valid values of \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and the number \( x \) Vasya received fit the described pattern. The pattern of settling in "the firstâ€“k -th" position is periodic with a period of \( 2k - 2 \).

The given program attempts to solve this problem by:
1. Checking if \( y = n + x \) is even. If not, it prints 0 because the pattern cannot fit.
2. If \( y \) is even, it calls a function `func_1` to find all divisors of \( \frac{y - 2}{2} \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
3. If \( n \geq 3x - 2 \), it also calls `func_1` on \( \frac{n - x}{2} \).
4. It combines the results from the two calls to `func_1`, removes duplicates, and prints the length of the resulting list.

The `func_1` function:
1. Computes the square root of \( q \).
2. Checks if the square root is an integer and greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \). If so, it adds the square root to the list `M`.
3. Iterates through all integers from 1 to the integer square root of \( q \), adding divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \) to `M`.

However, there are a few issues with the program:
1. The program does not correctly handle the periodic nature of the problem. It only considers the divisors of \( \frac{y - 2}{2} \) and \( \frac{n - x}{2} \), but it needs to consider the periodicity of the pattern, which is \( 2k - 2 \).
2. The program does not correctly account for the range of valid \( k \) values. It should consider the periodicity and the constraints on \( k \) to ensure that the pattern fits within the given position \( n \).

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine the number of valid \( k \) values for all test cases.

### Correctness: **False**
