You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16. The trump suit is a single character from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}. The description of 2n cards is a list of 2n unique two-character strings, where the first character is one of "23456789" and the second character is one of "CDHS".
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: `trumps` is a list of ranks of trump cards; `answers` is a list of sorted pairs of non-trump cards of the same suit; `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values either `None` or a rank of a non-trump card that did not form a pair.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: trumps is [], answers is [('2H', '3H'), 'A C 10S', 'K H JS'], suits is {'C': 'A', 'D': None, 'H': 'K', 'S': 'Q'}
    trumps = sorted(trumps, reverse=True)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: `trumps` is [], `answers` is [('2H', '3H'), 'A C 10S', 'K H JS'], `suits` is {'C': 'A', 'D': None, 'H': 'K', 'S': 'Q'}
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: trumps is [], answers is [('2H', '3H'), 'A C 10S', 'K H JS'], suits is {'C': 'A', 'D': None, 'H': 'K', 'S': 'Q'}
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 16, representing half the number of cards. It also accepts a character `trump_suit` which is one of 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S', indicating the trump suit. Additionally, it accepts a list of 2n unique two-character strings representing the cards, where the first character is a digit from "23456789" and the second character is one of "CDHS". The function returns the highest card based on the given rules: the highest card in the trump suit wins, otherwise, the highest card of the same suit as the first card wins, and if there's a tie, the card appearing first in the input list wins.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
