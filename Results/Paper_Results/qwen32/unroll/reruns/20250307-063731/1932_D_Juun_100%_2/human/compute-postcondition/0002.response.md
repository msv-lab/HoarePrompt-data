The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `trumps`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the `trumps` list being initialized.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; the trump suit is a single character from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'} as input; the description of 2n cards is a list of 2n unique two-character strings, where the first character is one of "23456789" and the second character is one of "CDHS"; `trumps` is an empty list.**
