The function processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of a set of cards and a trump suit. It determines the highest card based on the given rules: the highest card in the trump suit wins, otherwise, the highest card of the same suit as the first card wins, and if there's a tie, the card appearing first in the input list wins. The function outputs pairs of cards according to these rules and prints "IMPOSSIBLE" if it cannot form a valid pair.
