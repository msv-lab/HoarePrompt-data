### Reasoning:

The program aims to reconstruct the rounds of a card game given the discard pile and the trump suit. The approach taken by the program is to first separate the cards into non-trump cards and trump cards. Non-trump cards are paired based on their suits, and trump cards are paired among themselves, with the higher-ranked trump card beating the lower-ranked one.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the number of rounds, the trump suit, and the list of cards.

2. **Sorting and Pairing Non-Trump Cards**: The program iterates through the list of cards. If a card is a trump card, it adds its rank to the `trumps` list. If a card is not a trump card, it checks if there is already a card of the same suit in the `suits` dictionary. If there is, it forms a pair with the current card and the card stored in the dictionary, sorts them, and adds the pair to the `answers` list. If there is no card of the same suit in the dictionary, it stores the current card's rank in the dictionary.

3. **Handling Remaining Non-Trump Cards**: After processing all cards, the program checks if there are any remaining non-trump cards in the `suits` dictionary. If a non-trump card remains unpaired, the program tries to pair it with a trump card. If there are no trump cards available, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE" and exits the function.

4. **Pairing Trump Cards**: The program sorts the `trumps` list in descending order and pairs the trump cards among themselves, printing each pair.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints all the pairs stored in the `answers` list.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Non-Trump Card Pairing**: The program correctly pairs non-trump cards of the same suit. It ensures that each pair is sorted, meaning the higher-ranked card comes second in the pair.

- **Correctness of Trump Card Pairing**: The program correctly pairs trump cards among themselves, ensuring that the higher-ranked card beats the lower-ranked card.

- **Handling Remaining Non-Trump Cards**: The program correctly handles the case where there are remaining non-trump cards by attempting to pair them with trump cards. If no trump cards are available, it correctly identifies the situation as impossible.

- **Output Order**: The program outputs the pairs in the correct order, first the pairs of non-trump cards, then the pairs of trump cards.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to reconstruct the rounds of the card game given the discard pile and the trump suit. It handles all edge cases, such as when it is impossible to pair the remaining non-trump cards, and outputs the correct pairs in the required format.
