The code snippet sorts the `trumps` list in reverse order. Given that the initial state of `trumps` is an empty list `[]`, sorting it in reverse order will still result in an empty list. The other variables (`answers` and `suits`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`trumps` is [], `answers` is [('2H', '3H'), 'A C 10S', 'K H JS'], `suits` is {'C': 'A', 'D': None, 'H': 'K', 'S': 'Q'}**.
