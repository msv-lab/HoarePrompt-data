Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 16, representing half the number of cards. It also accepts a character `trump_suit` which is one of 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S', indicating the trump suit. Additionally, it accepts a list of 2n unique two-character strings representing the cards, where the first character is a digit from "23456789" and the second character is one of "CDHS". The function returns the highest card based on the given rules: the highest card in the trump suit wins, otherwise, the highest card of the same suit as the first card wins, and if there's a tie, the card appearing first in the input list wins.**
