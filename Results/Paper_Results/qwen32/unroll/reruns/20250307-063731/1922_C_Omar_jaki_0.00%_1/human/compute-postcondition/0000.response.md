The provided code snippet defines a lambda function `r` that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer. This function is typically used to read multiple integers from a single line of input.

Given the initial state, the code does not directly modify any of the existing variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `x`, `y`). Instead, it introduces a new function `r` that can be used to read input in a specific format.

Since the code does not alter any of the existing variables and only introduces a new function, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the addition of the function `r`.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; a is a list of n integers such that 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9; m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; and for each query, x and y are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ n and x ≠ y; r is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer.**
