You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

    5 1

Output

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

- Program:
def func():
    r = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    (t,) = r()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        r()
        a = (-1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0)
        b = [0, 0]
        for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
            v = y - x
            b += (b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y))
        print(b, 'B')
        (u,) = r()
        while u:
            u -= 1
            (c, d) = r()
            if c < d:
                print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
            else:
                print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of sorted distances of cities and a series of queries. Each query consists of two city indices, and the function determines the closest city to the first city that is not the second city, based on the precomputed distances. The results of these queries are printed for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of coins required to travel from one city to another based on the given problem description. The program seems to be attempting to precompute some values and then use them to answer queries, but the logic used does not align with the requirements of the problem.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Preprocessing Logic**:
   - The program initializes `a` with some sentinel values and then tries to compute some values in `b` using a loop. The logic inside the loop (`b += (b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y))`) is not clear and does not seem to correctly compute the distances or the closest cities.

2. **Query Handling**:
   - When handling queries, the program simply prints differences from the precomputed `b` array, which does not correspond to the minimum number of coins needed based on the problem description. The problem requires either traveling directly between cities or using the closest city mechanism.

3. **Lack of Closest City Calculation**:
   - The program does not explicitly calculate the closest city for each city, which is a crucial part of the problem. The closest city is defined as the city with the minimum distance, and the problem guarantees that for each city, this closest city is unique.

4. **Incorrect Output**:
   - The program does not handle the closest city mechanism or the direct travel mechanism correctly. It does not provide the minimum number of coins required for each query based on the problem description.

To fix the program, we need to correctly determine the closest city for each city and then use this information to answer each query by either traveling directly or using the closest city mechanism. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        cities = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        m = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        queries = []
        for _ in range(m):
            x, y = map(int, data[index:index + 2])
            queries.append((x, y))
            index += 2
        
        # Determine the closest city for each city
        closest = [0] * n
        for i in range(n):
            if i == 0:
                closest[i] = 1
            elif i == n - 1:
                closest[i] = n - 2
            else:
                if cities[i + 1] - cities[i] < cities[i] - cities[i - 1]:
                    closest[i] = i + 1
                else:
                    closest[i] = i - 1
        
        # Process each query
        for x, y in queries:
            x -= 1
            y -= 1
            cost = 0
            while x != y:
                if abs(cities[x] - cities[y]) <= 1:
                    cost += abs(cities[x] - cities[y])
                    x = y
                else:
                    cost += 1
                    if closest[x] < x:
                        x = closest[x]
                    else:
                        x = closest[x]
            results.append(cost)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected program calculates the closest city for each city and then uses this information to answer each query correctly.
