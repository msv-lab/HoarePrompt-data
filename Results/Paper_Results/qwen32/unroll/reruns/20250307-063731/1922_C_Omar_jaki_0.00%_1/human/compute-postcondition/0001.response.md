Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; and for each query, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ n and x ≠ y; `r` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer.**

In simple terms, `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer read from the input, while all other variables remain as they were initially described.
