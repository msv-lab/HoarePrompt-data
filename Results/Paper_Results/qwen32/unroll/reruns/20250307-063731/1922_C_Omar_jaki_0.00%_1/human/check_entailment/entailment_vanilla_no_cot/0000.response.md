Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. Here are some key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities**: The program does not correctly determine the closest city for each city based on the given criteria. The closest city for each city is not calculated, and the logic for determining it is not present.

2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate some values in `b` using a complex formula involving powers, but this does not correspond to the correct way to compute the minimum cost of traveling between cities. The cost calculation should involve checking the cost of moving to the closest city versus moving directly to the target city.

3. **Incorrect Query Handling**: The program does not correctly handle the queries. It attempts to use the precomputed values in `b` to answer the queries, but these values are not meaningful in the context of the problem.

4. **Output Mismatch**: The program prints intermediate values during the execution, which is not part of the expected output. It should only print the minimum number of coins for each query.

To solve the problem correctly, the program should:
- Determine the closest city for each city.
- For each query, compute the minimum cost of traveling between the two cities, considering the option of moving to the closest city versus moving directly.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.
