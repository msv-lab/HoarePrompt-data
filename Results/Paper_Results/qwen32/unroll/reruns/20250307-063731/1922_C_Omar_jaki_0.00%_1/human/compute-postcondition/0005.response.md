Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of sorted distances of cities and a series of queries. Each query consists of two city indices, and the function determines the closest city to the first city that is not the second city, based on the precomputed distances. The results of these queries are printed for each test case.**
