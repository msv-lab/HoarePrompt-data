Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of cities, a list `a` of `n` integers representing the unique, sorted distances of these cities, an integer `m` representing the number of queries, and for each query, two integers `x` and `y` representing the indices of two different cities. The function processes each query to determine the closest city to city `x` that is not city `y`. The function returns a list of results corresponding to each query, where each result indicates the index of the closest city to city `x` that is not city `y`.**
