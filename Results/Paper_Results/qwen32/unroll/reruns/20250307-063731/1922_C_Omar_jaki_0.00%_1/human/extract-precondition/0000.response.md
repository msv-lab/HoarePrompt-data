Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; a is a list of n integers such that 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9; m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; and for each query, x and y are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ n and x ≠ y. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. Additionally, for each city in each test case, the closest city is uniquely determined.**
