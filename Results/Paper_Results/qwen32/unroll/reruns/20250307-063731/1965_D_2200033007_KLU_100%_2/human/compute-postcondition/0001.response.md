To determine the output state, let's analyze the loop and its effects on `bigList` and `smallList`.

The loop runs as long as `smallList` is not empty and the last element of `bigList` matches the last element of `smallList`. In each iteration, it removes the last element from both `bigList` and `smallList`.

This means that the loop will continue to remove elements from the end of `bigList` (and `smallList`) as long as they match. Once a mismatch is found, or `smallList` becomes empty, the loop terminates.

**Output State: **The last common elements of `bigList` and `smallList` (from the end) are removed. The remaining elements in `bigList` are those that do not match the end elements of `smallList` in sequence. `smallList` will be empty if all its elements matched the end of `bigList`.**

In simpler terms, the loop removes the trailing elements from `bigList` that exactly match the trailing elements of `smallList`. Once all matching elements are removed, `smallList` will be empty, and `bigList` will have the trailing matching elements removed as well.
