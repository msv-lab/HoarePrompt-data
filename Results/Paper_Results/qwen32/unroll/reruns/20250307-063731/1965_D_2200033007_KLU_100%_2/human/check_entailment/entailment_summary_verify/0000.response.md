### Reasoning:

The provided program consists of four functions intended to solve the problem of reconstructing a palindrome array from given subarray sums. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness using the provided function summaries and the problem description.

#### Function Analysis:

1. **`func_1(a)`**:
   - **Purpose**: Generates all subarray sums of the array `a` and returns them sorted.
   - **Functionality**: Correctly generates all subarray sums and sorts them. This is necessary for identifying the unique sums that appear an odd number of times.

2. **`func_2(cts)`**:
   - **Purpose**: Processes the sorted subarray sums to identify the unique sums that appear an odd number of times.
   - **Functionality**: Correctly identifies the unique sums that appear an odd number of times. Since each subarray sum appears an even number of times except for the missing one, this function should correctly identify the missing subarray sum.

3. **`func_3(odds, n)`**:
   - **Purpose**: Constructs the palindrome array `a` using the unique sums.
   - **Functionality**: Constructs the palindrome array using the unique sums. It correctly assigns values to the array such that it remains a palindrome. The logic is based on the idea that the difference between consecutive sums in the `odds` list corresponds to the elements of the palindrome array.

4. **`func_4(bigList, smallList)`**:
   - **Purpose**: Finds the missing subarray sum by removing common elements from the end of `bigList` and `smallList`.
   - **Functionality**: Correctly identifies the missing subarray sum by removing common elements from the end of `bigList` and `smallList`. However, this function is not used in the provided code.

#### Verification:

Let's verify the program's correctness by analyzing the logic and ensuring it aligns with the problem requirements.

1. **Generating Subarray Sums (`func_1`)**:
   - The function correctly generates all possible subarray sums and sorts them. This is a necessary step for identifying the unique sums that appear an odd number of times.

2. **Identifying Unique Sums (`func_2`)**:
   - The function correctly identifies the unique sums that appear an odd number of times. Since each subarray sum appears an even number of times except for the missing one, this function should correctly identify the missing subarray sum.

3. **Constructing the Palindrome Array (`func_3`)**:
   - The function constructs the palindrome array using the unique sums. It correctly assigns values to the array such that it remains a palindrome. The logic is based on the idea that the difference between consecutive sums in the `odds` list corresponds to the elements of the palindrome array. This is a valid approach because the subarray sums of a palindrome have specific properties that allow us to reconstruct the array.

4. **Finding the Missing Sum (`func_4`)**:
   - Although `func_4` is not used in the provided code, if it were, it would correctly identify the missing subarray sum by removing common elements from the end of `bigList` and `smallList`.

### Testing the Program:

Let's test the program with the provided examples to ensure it works as expected.

1. **First Example**:
   - Input: `3`, `1 2 3 4 1`
   - Expected Output: `1 2 1`
   - The program should correctly identify the missing subarray sum and construct the palindrome array.

2. **Second Example**:
   - Input: `4`, `18 2 11 9 7 11 7 2 9`
   - Expected Output: `7 2 2 7`
   - The program should correctly identify the missing subarray sum and construct the palindrome array.

3. **Third Example**:
   - Input: `4`, `5 10 5 16 3 3 13 8 8`
   - Expected Output: `3 5 5 3`
   - The program should correctly identify the missing subarray sum and construct the palindrome array.

4. **Fourth Example**:
   - Input: `4`, `8 10 4 6 4 20 14 14 6`
   - Expected Output: `6 4 4 6`
   - The program should correctly identify the missing subarray sum and construct the palindrome array.

5. **Fifth Example**:
   - Input: `5`, `1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 2 1`
   - Expected Output: `1 1 1 1 1`
   - The program should correctly identify the missing subarray sum and construct the palindrome array.

6. **Sixth Example**:
   - Input: `5`, `1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 4 5 5 6 8`
   - Expected Output: `2 1 2 1 2`
   - The program should correctly identify the missing subarray sum and construct the palindrome array.

7. **Seventh Example**:
   - Input: `3`, `500000000 1000000000 500000000 500000000 1000000000`
   - Expected Output: `500000000 500000000 500000000`
   - The program should correctly identify the missing subarray sum and construct the palindrome array.

### Conclusion:
