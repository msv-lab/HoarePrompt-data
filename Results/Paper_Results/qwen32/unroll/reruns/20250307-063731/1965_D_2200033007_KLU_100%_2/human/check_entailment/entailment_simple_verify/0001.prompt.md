You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Palindrome Array**: The array `a` is a palindrome, meaning `a[i] = a[n - 1 - i]` for all `i`.
2. **Subarray Sums**: We are given all but one of the subarray sums of `a`. We need to find the missing subarray sum and then reconstruct the array `a`.
3. **Reconstruction**: The input guarantees that there is always at least one valid solution.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function 1: `func_1(a)`**
   - This function generates all possible subarray sums of the array `a` and returns them in sorted order.
   - It iterates through each starting index `i` and calculates the sum of subarrays starting from `i` to the end of the array.
   - The subarray sums are stored in the list `cts` and then sorted.

2. **Function 2: `func_2(cts)`**
   - This function processes the sorted list of subarray sums `cts` to find the subarray sum that appears an odd number of times.
   - It uses a list `odds` to keep track of subarray sums that appear an odd number of times.
   - If a subarray sum appears twice consecutively in the sorted list, it removes the last occurrence from `odds`.
   - The remaining elements in `odds` are the subarray sums that appear an odd number of times.

3. **Function 3: `func_3(odds, n)`**
   - This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the list of subarray sums that appear an odd number of times.
   - It initializes an array `a` of size `n` with zeros.
   - It uses a variable `prev` to keep track of the previous subarray sum and an index `idx` to place elements in the middle of the array.
   - For each subarray sum `x` in `odds`, it calculates the value to place in the array `a` and its mirror position.
   - It updates `prev` and `idx` accordingly.

4. **Function 4: `func_4(bigList, smallList)`**
   - This function finds the missing subarray sum by comparing the sorted list of all possible subarray sums (`bigList`) with the sorted list of given subarray sums (`smallList`).
   - It removes the common elements from the end of both lists and returns the last element of `bigList`, which is the missing subarray sum.

### Verification:
- **Generating Subarray Sums**: `func_1(a)` correctly generates all subarray sums.
- **Finding Odd Occurrences**: `func_2(cts)` correctly identifies the subarray sums that appear an odd number of times.
- **Reconstructing the Array**: `func_3(odds, n)` correctly reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the identified subarray sums.
- **Finding the Missing Sum**: `func_4(bigList, smallList)` correctly identifies the missing subarray sum.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by generating all subarray sums, identifying the odd occurrences, reconstructing the palindrome array, and finding the missing subarray sum. Given the constraints and the problem guarantees, the program should work as expected.
