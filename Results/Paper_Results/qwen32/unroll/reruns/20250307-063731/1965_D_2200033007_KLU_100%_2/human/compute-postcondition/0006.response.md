Functionality: **The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `odds`, which is a list of integers representing the sums of subarrays of a palindrome array `a`, and `n`, which is an integer representing the size of the palindrome array `a` with the constraint that 3 <= n <= 1000. The function returns the palindrome array `a` constructed from the `odds` list.**
