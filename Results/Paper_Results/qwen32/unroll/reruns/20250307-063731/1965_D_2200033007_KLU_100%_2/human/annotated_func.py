#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list `a` of `n` positive integers (where `n` is between 3 and 1000) and returns a sorted list of all cumulative sums of subarrays starting from each index `i` to the end of the list `a`.

    #The program returns the palindrome array `a` constructed from the `odds` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` constructs and returns a palindrome array `a` of size `n` using the provided list of integers `odds`, which represents the sums of subarrays of the palindrome array `a`.

    return bigList[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of `bigList` after removing the last common elements with `smallList` from the end.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists of integers, `bigList` and `smallList`, and removes the last common elements between them from the end of `bigList`. It then returns the last element of the modified `bigList`.
