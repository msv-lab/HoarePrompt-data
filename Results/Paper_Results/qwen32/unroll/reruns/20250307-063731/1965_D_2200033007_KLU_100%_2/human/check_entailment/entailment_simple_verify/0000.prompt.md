You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    500000000 1000000000 500000000 500000000 1000000000

Output

    1 2 1 
    7 2 2 7 
    3 5 5 3 
    6 4 4 6 
    1 1 1 1 1 
    2 1 2 1 2 
    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to recover a palindrome array `a` of size `n` given `n*(n+1)/2 - 1` subarray sums.
- The array `a` is a palindrome, meaning `a[i] = a[n+1-i]` for all `1 <= i <= n`.
- The input consists of multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` and a list of `n*(n+1)/2 - 1` subarray sums.
- The output should be a valid palindrome array `a` for each test case.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of four functions:
1. `func_1(a)`: Generates all subarray sums of the array `a` and returns them sorted.
2. `func_2(cts)`: Processes the sorted subarray sums to identify the unique sums that appear an odd number of times.
3. `func_3(odds, n)`: Constructs the palindrome array `a` using the unique sums.
4. `func_4(bigList, smallList)`: This function seems to be unused in the provided code and likely intended for finding the missing subarray sum.

### Verification:
Let's verify if the program correctly handles the problem requirements:

1. **Generating Subarray Sums (`func_1`)**: This function correctly generates all subarray sums of the array `a` and sorts them. This is a necessary step to identify the unique sums that appear an odd number of times.

2. **Identifying Unique Sums (`func_2`)**: This function correctly identifies the unique sums that appear an odd number of times. Since each subarray sum appears an even number of times except for the missing one, this function should correctly identify the missing subarray sum.

3. **Constructing the Palindrome Array (`func_3`)**: This function constructs the palindrome array using the unique sums. It correctly assigns values to the array such that it remains a palindrome.

4. **Finding the Missing Sum (`func_4`)**: This function is not used in the provided code, but if it were, it would correctly identify the missing subarray sum.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with the provided examples to ensure it works as expected.

### Example Test Cases:
1. **First Example**:
   - Input: `3`, `1 2 3 4 1`
   - Expected Output: `1 2 1`

2. **Second Example**:
   - Input: `4`, `18 2 11 9 7 11 7 2 9`
   - Expected Output: `7 2 2 7`
   - The program should correctly identify the missing subarray sum and construct the palindrome array.

3. **Third Example**:
   - Input: `4`, `5 10 5 16 3 3 13 8 8`
   - Expected Output: `3 5 5 3`
   - The program should correctly identify the missing subarray sum and construct the palindrome array.

4. **Fourth Example**:
   - Input: `4`, `8 10 4 6 4 20 14 14 6`
   - Expected Output: `6 4 4 6`
   - The program should correctly identify the missing subarray sum and construct the palindrome array.

5. **Fifth Example**:
   - Input: `5`, `1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 2 1`
   - Expected Output: `1 1 1 1 1`
   - The program should correctly identify the missing subarray sum and construct the palindrome array.

6. **Sixth Example**:
   - Input: `5`, `1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 4 5 5 6 8`
   - Expected Output: `2 1 2 1 2`
   - The program should correctly identify the missing subarray sum and construct the palindrome array.

7. **Seventh Example**:
   - Input: `3`, `500000000 1000000000 500000000 500000000 1000000000`
   - Expected Output: `500000000 500000000 500000000`
   - The program should correctly identify the missing subarray sum and construct the palindrome array.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and testing, the program appears to correctly solve the problem for the provided examples. The program generates all subarray sums, identifies the unique sums that appear an odd number of times, and constructs a valid palindrome array using these sums.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
