Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Palindrome Array**: The array `a` is a palindrome, meaning `a[i] = a[n - 1 - i]` for all `i`.
2. **Subarray Sums**: We are given all but one of the subarray sums of `a`. We need to find the missing subarray sum and then reconstruct the array `a`.
3. **Reconstruction**: The input guarantees that there is always at least one valid solution.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function 1: `func_1(a)`**
   - This function generates all possible subarray sums of the array `a` and returns them in sorted order.
   - It iterates through each starting index `i` and calculates the sum of subarrays starting from `i` to the end of the array.
   - The subarray sums are stored in the list `cts` and then sorted.

2. **Function 2: `func_2(cts)`**
   - This function processes the sorted list of subarray sums `cts` to find the subarray sum that appears an odd number of times.
   - It uses a list `odds` to keep track of subarray sums that appear an odd number of times.
   - If a subarray sum appears twice consecutively in the sorted list, it removes the last occurrence from `odds`.
   - The remaining elements in `odds` are the subarray sums that appear an odd number of times.

3. **Function 3: `func_3(odds, n)`**
   - This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the list of subarray sums that appear an odd number of times.
   - It initializes an array `a` of size `n` with zeros.
   - It uses a variable `prev` to keep track of the previous subarray sum and an index `idx` to place elements in the middle of the array.
   - For each subarray sum `x` in `odds`, it calculates the value to place in the array `a` and its mirror position.
   - It updates `prev` and `idx` accordingly.

4. **Function 4: `func_4(bigList, smallList)`**
   - This function finds the missing subarray sum by comparing the sorted list of all possible subarray sums (`bigList`) with the sorted list of given subarray sums (`smallList`).
   - It removes the common elements from the end of both lists and returns the last element of `bigList`, which is the missing subarray sum.

### Verification:
- **Generating Subarray Sums**: `func_1(a)` correctly generates all subarray sums.
- **Finding Odd Occurrences**: `func_2(cts)` correctly identifies the subarray sums that appear an odd number of times.
- **Reconstructing the Array**: `func_3(odds, n)` correctly reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the identified subarray sums.
- **Finding the Missing Sum**: `func_4(bigList, smallList)` correctly identifies the missing subarray sum.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by generating all subarray sums, identifying the odd occurrences, reconstructing the palindrome array, and finding the missing subarray sum. Given the constraints and the problem guarantees, the program should work as expected.

Correctness: **True**
