### Reasoning:

Let's analyze each function to see if they collectively meet the problem description.

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function takes a list `a` and returns a sorted list of all subarray sums.
   - This is correct and necessary to generate all possible subarray sums from a given array `a`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function is supposed to remove consecutive duplicates from a list.
   - However, the provided description and implementation are incorrect. The function is described to always return `[1, 3, 5]` regardless of the input, which is not the intended behavior. The function should remove consecutive duplicates and return the modified list.
   - The current implementation does not meet the problem's requirements.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function constructs a palindrome array `a` from a list of subarray sums `odds`.
   - The logic seems correct for constructing a palindrome array from the provided subarray sums. It correctly handles the construction by ensuring symmetry around the center.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - This function removes the last common elements from the end of `bigList` and `smallList` and returns the last element of the modified `bigList`.
   - This function seems to correctly identify the missing subarray sum by comparing the generated subarray sums with the provided ones.

### Conclusion:

The main issue is with `func_2`. The function is described to always return `[1, 3, 5]`, which is incorrect. The function should properly remove consecutive duplicates from the list of subarray sums.

Given the description and the provided code, `func_2` is not implemented correctly according to the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program as a whole does not meet the problem description.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
