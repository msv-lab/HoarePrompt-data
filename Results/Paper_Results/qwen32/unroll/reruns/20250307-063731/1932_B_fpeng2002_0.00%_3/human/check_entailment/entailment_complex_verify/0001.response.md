### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to verify the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Breakdown
The problem requires us to determine the year when the n-th sign will occur, given that each sign i occurs every `a_i` years, and each subsequent sign can only occur after the previous one has occurred. Essentially, we need to find the first year where each sign can occur sequentially according to their given periodicities.

#### Program Analysis
The program follows these steps:
1. **Input Reading**: It reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, reads the number of signs and their periodicities.
2. **Logic to Find the Year**:
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by:
     - Adding 1 to `start_year` to move to the next year after the current `start_year`.
     - Dividing by the periodicity `nums[x]` to find the number of full cycles that have passed.
     - Adding 1 to the result to account for the next cycle.
     - Multiplying back by `nums[x]` to get the actual year of the next occurrence.
   - This process is repeated for all signs.

#### Detailed Calculation Example
Let's verify the logic with the first example from the problem statement:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - `n = 6`
  - `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - **Step-by-step Calculation**:
    - `start_year = 0`
    - For the first sign (periodicity 3):
      - `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
    - For the second sign (periodicity 2):
      - `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
    - For the third sign (periodicity 4):
      - `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
    - For the fourth sign (periodicity 5):
      - `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
    - For the fifth sign (periodicity 9):
      - `start_year = ((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
    - For the sixth sign (periodicity 18):
      - `start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`

The result matches the expected output, which is 36.

#### Additional Test Cases
Let's verify a couple more test cases to ensure the logic is correct:

- **Test Case 2**:
  - `n = 5`
  - `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - **Step-by-step Calculation**:
    - `start_year = 0`
    - For the first sign (periodicity 1):
      - `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2`
    - For the second sign (periodicity 2):
      - `start_year = ((2 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
    - For the third sign (periodicity 3):
      - `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 6`
    - For the fourth sign (periodicity 4):
      - `start_year = ((6 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
    - For the fifth sign (periodicity 5):
      - `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`

The result does not match the expected output, which is 5. Let's re-evaluate the logic:

The correct logic should be:
- `start_year = 0`
- For the first sign (periodicity 1):
  - `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 1) * 1 = 1`
- For the second sign (periodicity 2):
  - `start_year = ((1 + 1) // 2) * 2 = 2`
- For the third sign (periodicity 3):
  - `start_year = ((2 + 1) // 3) * 3 = 3`
- For the fourth sign (periodicity 4):
  - `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 4) * 4 = 4`
- For the fifth sign (periodicity 5):
  - `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 5) * 5 = 5`

The correct logic should be:
- `start_year = 0`
- For each sign, calculate the next occurrence year by:
  - Finding the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.

The correct formula should be:
- `start_year = ((start_year + nums[x] - 1) // nums[x]) * nums[x]`

#### Corrected Program
Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + nums[x] - 1) // nums[x]) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)
```

#### Conclusion
The original program logic was incorrect. The corrected logic ensures that the next occurrence year is the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year + 1`.

### Final Evaluation
