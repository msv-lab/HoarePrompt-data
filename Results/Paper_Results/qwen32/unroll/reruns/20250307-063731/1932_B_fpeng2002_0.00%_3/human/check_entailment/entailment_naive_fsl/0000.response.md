Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur given the periodicity of each sign. The signs must occur sequentially, and once a sign occurs, the tribe waits for the next sign to occur strictly after the year of the previous sign.

### Program Analysis

The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of signs and their respective periodicities. It then calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur using the following logic:

1. Initialize `start_year` to 0.
2. For each sign, calculate the next occurrence year as follows:
   - `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`
3. Print the final `start_year` which represents the year the n-th sign will occur.

### Code Review

Let's break down the logic of the code:
- `start_year` starts at 0.
- For each sign, the next occurrence year is calculated by finding the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.
- This is done by the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

### Testing the Program

Let's test the program with the provided example inputs to see if it produces the correct outputs:

#### Example Input 1
```
4
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
5
1 2 3 4 5
5
1 1 1 1 1
6
50 30 711 200 503 1006
```

#### Expected Output
```
36
5
5
2012
```

#### Program Output
Let's simulate the program to verify the output:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Signs: [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]
   - Year 1: Next multiple of 3 is 3
   - Year 4: Next multiple of 2 is 4
   - Year 8: Next multiple of 4 is 8
   - Year 10: Next multiple of 5 is 10
   - Year 18: Next multiple of 9 is 18
   - Year 36: Next multiple of 18 is 36
   - Output: 36 (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Signs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   - Year 1: Next multiple of 1 is 1
   - Year 2: Next multiple of 2 is 2
   - Year 3: Next multiple of 3 is 3
   - Year 4: Next multiple of 4 is 4
   - Year 5: Next multiple of 5 is 5
   - Output: 5 (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Signs: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
   - Year 1: Next multiple of 1 is 1
   - Year 2: Next multiple of 1 is 2
   - Year 3: Next multiple of 1 is 3
   - Year 4: Next multiple of 1 is 4
   - Year 5: Next multiple of 1 is 5
   - Output: 5 (Correct)

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Signs: [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]
   - Year 1: Next multiple of 50 is 50
   - Year 80: Next multiple of 30 is 90
   - Year 1611: Next multiple of 711 is 2133
   - Year 2333: Next multiple of 200 is 2400
   - Year 2836: Next multiple of 503 is 3036
   - Year 4042: Next multiple of 1006 is 5036
   - Output: 2012 (Incorrect, should be 5036)

### Conclusion

The program does not produce the correct output for the fourth test case. The logic seems to be incorrect in handling the calculation of the next occurrence year.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation
The program fails to produce the correct output for at least one of the test cases (the fourth one). The logic for calculating the next occurrence year seems to be flawed, leading to incorrect results.
