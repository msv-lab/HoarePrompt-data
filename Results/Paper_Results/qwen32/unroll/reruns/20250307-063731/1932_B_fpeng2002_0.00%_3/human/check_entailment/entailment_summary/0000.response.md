### Reasoning:

The given problem requires us to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs, considering that each sign must occur sequentially and each sign occurs periodically. The program iterates through each sign's periodicity and calculates the year in which each sign occurs, starting from the year after the previous sign occurred.

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. **Initialization**: The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0. This represents the year from which we start waiting for the first sign to occur.

2. **Iterating through signs**: For each sign, the program calculates the next year in which this sign will occur, given that the previous signs have already occurred.

3. **Calculating the occurrence year**:
   - `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`:
     - `(start_year + 1)` shifts the start year to the next year after the previous sign occurred.
     - `// nums[x]` calculates how many full periods fit into the shifted start year.
     - `+ 1` ensures that we consider the next period after the last full period in the shifted start year.
     - `* nums[x]` calculates the actual year in which the next sign will occur.

4. **Updating `start_year`**: The calculated year for the current sign becomes the new `start_year` for the next sign.

### Example Walkthrough:

For the first test case in the example:
- `n = 6`
- `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`

1. **First sign**: `start_year = 0`
   - `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
2. **Second sign**: `start_year = 3`
   - `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
3. **Third sign**: `start_year = 4`
   - `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
4. **Fourth sign**: `start_year = 8`
   - `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
5. **Fifth sign**: `start_year = 10`
   - `start_year = ((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
6. **Sixth sign**: `start_year = 18`
   - `start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`

The final `start_year` is 36, which matches the expected output for the first test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur for each test case. The logic is consistent with the problem description, and the example walkthrough confirms that the program produces the correct output.

**Correctness: True**
