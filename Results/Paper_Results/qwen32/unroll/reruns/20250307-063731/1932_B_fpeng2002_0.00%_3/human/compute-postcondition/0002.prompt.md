Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num_tests` is an input integer between 1 and 1000; the input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) indicating the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs.
Code of the loop:
while num_tests > 0:
    num_tests -= 1
    n = int(input())
    nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    start_year = 0
    for x in range(0, len(nums)):
        start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
    print(start_year)



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
