The provided Python code processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves finding the earliest common year when all signs (with given periodicities) will be active simultaneously. The loop processes each test case individually, and the output for each test case is the earliest common year.

Since the loop processes each test case independently and outputs the result immediately after processing each one, the state of `num_tests` is decremented until it reaches zero, meaning all test cases have been processed. The variables `n`, `nums`, and `start_year` are local to each iteration of the outer while loop and do not persist between different test cases.

### Output State Explanation:
- `num_tests` will be **0** after all test cases have been processed.
- The variables `n`, `nums`, and `start_year` will not have a consistent state outside the loop since they are redefined in each iteration.
- The output for each test case (the earliest common year) is printed as soon as it is computed, so there is no stored output in the variables after the loop ends.

Output State: **num_tests is 0.**
