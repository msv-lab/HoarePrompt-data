### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse occurs, given the periodicity of each sign. The program processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of signs and their respective periodicities.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic in the program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The number of test cases (`t`) is read first.
   - For each test case, the number of signs (`n`) is read.
   - The periodicities of the signs (`a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) are read into a list.

2. **Calculation of the Year for Each Test Case:**
   - The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0. This variable will keep track of the current year as we wait for each sign to occur.
   - For each sign in the list, the program calculates the next occurrence of the sign based on the current `start_year`.
   - The formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` ensures that the program finds the smallest year greater than `start_year` that is a multiple of the current sign's periodicity (`nums[x]`).
   - This calculated year becomes the new `start_year` for the next sign.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the final `start_year` is printed, which represents the year when the n-th sign occurs, leading to the apocalypse.

### Analysis of the Formula:
- The formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` works as follows:
  - `(start_year + 1) // nums[x]` calculates the number of complete cycles of the current sign's periodicity that have passed up to `start_year`.
  - Adding `1` to this value ensures that we are looking for the next cycle.
  - Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the exact year in which the next occurrence of the sign will happen.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the year when the n-th sign occurs, taking into account the sequential nature of the signs' occurrences. The provided example outputs match the expected results based on the problem description, indicating that the program is functioning as intended.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
