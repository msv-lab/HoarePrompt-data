Let's carefully analyze the given problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to determine if the program is indeed correct.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given that each i-th sign occurs every a_i years, and the signs must occur sequentially. This means that after the i-th sign occurs in year x, the (i+1)-th sign can only occur in a year y where y > x.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of signs and their respective periodicities. It then calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur using the following logic:

1. Initialize `start_year` to 0.
2. For each sign, update `start_year` as follows:
   - Add 1 to `start_year` to move to the next year after the current `start_year`.
   - Divide by the periodicity `nums[x]` to find the number of full cycles that have passed.
   - Add 1 to the result to account for the next cycle.
   - Multiply back by `nums[x]` to get the actual year of the next occurrence.

### Detailed Calculation Example
Let's verify the logic with the first example from the problem statement:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - `n = 6`
  - `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - **Step-by-step Calculation**:
    - `start_year = 0`
    - For the first sign (periodicity 3):
      - `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
    - For the second sign (periodicity 2):
      - `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 6` (incorrect, should be 4)
    - For the third sign (periodicity 4):
      - `start_year = ((6 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8` (incorrect, should be 8 if starting from 4)
    - For the fourth sign (periodicity 5):
      - `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10` (correct if starting from 4)
    - For the fifth sign (periodicity 9):
      - `start_year = ((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18` (correct if starting from 10)
    - For the sixth sign (periodicity 18):
      - `start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36` (correct if starting from 18)

The calculation for the second sign is incorrect. The correct calculation should be:
- `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly calculate the year in which the n-th sign will occur for all given test cases due to an error in the logic. Specifically, the logic for calculating the next occurrence year is flawed. The formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` does not correctly account for the sequential occurrence of signs.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in calculating the next occurrence year of each sign.
