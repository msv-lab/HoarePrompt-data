Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to verify the correctness of the given solution.

### Problem Analysis Recap

The problem requires us to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicity of each sign. The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the next sign can only occur after the previous one has occurred.

### Program Analysis

The provided program reads the input test cases and for each test case, it calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur using the following logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `start_year` is initialized to 0.

2. **Iterate through each sign**:
   - For each sign with periodicity `nums[x]`:
     - The next occurrence year is calculated using the formula:
       ```python
       start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
       ```
     - This formula is intended to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.

### Detailed Calculation Example

Let's verify the logic with the first example from the problem statement:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - `n = 6`
  - `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - **Step-by-step Calculation**:
    - `start_year = 0`
    - For the first sign (periodicity 3):
      - `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
    - For the second sign (periodicity 2):
      - `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
    - For the third sign (periodicity 4):
      - `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
    - For the fourth sign (periodicity 5):
      - `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
    - For the fifth sign (periodicity 9):
      - `start_year = ((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
    - For the sixth sign (periodicity 18):
      - `start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`

The result matches the expected output, which is 36.

### Annotation Analysis

The annotations provided seem to describe the state of the program correctly, but let's re-evaluate the formula used in the program:

The formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is intended to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`. However, let's verify if this formula is correct by considering another test case:

- **Test Case 2**:
  - `n = 5`
  - `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - **Step-by-step Calculation**:
    - `start_year = 0`
    - For the first sign (periodicity 1):
      - `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2` (Incorrect, should be 1)
    - For the second sign (periodicity 2):
      - `start_year = ((2 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 6` (Incorrect, should be 2)
    - For the third sign (periodicity 3):
      - `start_year = ((6 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 12` (Incorrect, should be 3)
    - For the fourth sign (periodicity 4):
      - `start_year = ((12 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 20` (Incorrect, should be 4)
    - For the fifth sign (periodicity 5):
      - `start_year = ((20 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 25` (Incorrect, should be 5)

Clearly, the formula is incorrect. The correct formula should find the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`. The correct formula should be:

```python
start_year = ((start_year // nums[x]) + 1) * nums[x]
```

### Conclusion

The provided program is incorrect due to the wrong formula used to calculate the next occurrence year. The correct formula should be `((start_year // nums[x]) + 1) * nums[x]`.

Final: **False**
