Output State: **`num_tests` is an input integer between 1 and 1000; the input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) indicating the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs.**
