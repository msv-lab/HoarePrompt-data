### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur based on the periodicity of each sign. The program iterates through the list of periodicities and calculates the year for each sign to occur sequentially.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities.

2. **Calculation of the Year for Each Sign**:
   - The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0. This variable keeps track of the year after which the next sign is expected to occur.
   - For each sign `x` in the list of periodicities, the program calculates the next occurrence year as follows:
     - It first increments `start_year` by 1 to ensure that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
     - It then calculates the next multiple of the periodicity `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year + 1` using the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
     - This formula works by finding the smallest integer `k` such that `k * nums[x] >= start_year + 1` and setting `start_year` to `k * nums[x]`.

3. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the first test case from the example:

- **Input**:
  ```
  6
  3 2 4 5 9 18
  ```
- **Processing**:
  - **First Sign**: `start_year = 0`. The next occurrence is `((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`.
  - **Second Sign**: `start_year = 3`. The next occurrence is `((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`.
  - **Third Sign**: `start_year = 4`. The next occurrence is `((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`.
  - **Fourth Sign**: `start_year = 8`. The next occurrence is `((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`.
  - **Fifth Sign**: `start_year = 10`. The next occurrence is `((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`.
  - **Sixth Sign**: `start_year = 18`. The next occurrence is `((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`.
- **Output**: `36`, which matches the expected result.

The program correctly calculates the year for each sign to occur and handles the sequential occurrence requirement as specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided example. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:
