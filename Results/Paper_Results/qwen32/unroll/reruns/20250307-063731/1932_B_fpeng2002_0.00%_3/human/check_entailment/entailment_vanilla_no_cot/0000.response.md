Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly compute the year in which the n-th sign will occur. Specifically, the line `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` does not correctly find the next occurrence of the i-th sign after the (i-1)-th sign has occurred. 

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for period in nums:
            # Find the next occurrence of the sign after start_year
            start_year = ((start_year + period - 1) // period + 1) * period
        print(start_year - period)  # Subtract the period to get the correct year

func()
```

However, the last line should be simply `print(start_year)` because `start_year` already holds the correct year after the loop. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for period in nums:
            # Find the next occurrence of the sign after start_year
            start_year = ((start_year + period - 1) // period + 1) * period
        print(start_year)

func()
```

This version correctly calculates the year in which each subsequent sign occurs after the previous one.
