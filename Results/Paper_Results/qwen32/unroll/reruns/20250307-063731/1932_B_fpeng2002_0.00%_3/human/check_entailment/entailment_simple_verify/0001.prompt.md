You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

We need to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicity of each sign. The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the next sign can only occur after the previous one has occurred.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program first reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs and their respective periodicities.

2. **Logic to Find the Year**:
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by:
     - Adding 1 to `start_year` to move to the next year after the current `start_year`.
     - Dividing by the periodicity `nums[x]` to find the number of full cycles that have passed.
     - Adding 1 to the result to account for the next cycle.
     - Multiplying back by `nums[x]` to get the actual year of the next occurrence.
   - This process is repeated for all signs.

### Detailed Calculation Example

Let's verify the logic with the first example from the problem statement:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - `n = 6`
  - `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - **Step-by-step Calculation**:
    - `start_year = 0`
    - For the first sign (periodicity 3):
      - `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
    - For the second sign (periodicity 2):
      - `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
    - For the third sign (periodicity 4):
      - `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
    - For the fourth sign (periodicity 5):
      - `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
    - For the fifth sign (periodicity 9):
      - `start_year = ((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
    - For the sixth sign (periodicity 18):
      - `start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`

The result matches the expected output, which is 36.

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur for all given test cases based on the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
