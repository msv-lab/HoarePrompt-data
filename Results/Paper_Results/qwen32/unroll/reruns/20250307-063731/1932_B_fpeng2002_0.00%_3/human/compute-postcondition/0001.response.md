The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute.

Given that `num_tests` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, it is already ensured that `num_tests` will be greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`num_tests` is an input integer between 1 and 1000**
