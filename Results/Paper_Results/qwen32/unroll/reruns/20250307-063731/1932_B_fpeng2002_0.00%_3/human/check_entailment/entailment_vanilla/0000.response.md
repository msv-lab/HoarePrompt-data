Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

We need to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicity of each sign. The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the next sign can only occur after the previous one has occurred.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program first reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs and their respective periodicities.

2. **Logic to Find the Year**:
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by:
     - Adding 1 to `start_year` to move to the next year after the current `start_year`.
     - Dividing by the periodicity `nums[x]` to find the number of full cycles that have passed.
     - Adding 1 to the result to account for the next cycle.
     - Multiplying back by `nums[x]` to get the actual year of the next occurrence.
   - This process is repeated for all signs.

### Detailed Calculation Example

Let's verify the logic with the first example from the problem statement:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - `n = 6`
  - `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - **Step-by-step Calculation**:
    - `start_year = 0`
    - For the first sign (periodicity 3):
      - `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
    - For the second sign (periodicity 2):
      - `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
    - For the third sign (periodicity 4):
      - `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
    - For the fourth sign (periodicity 5):
      - `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
    - For the fifth sign (periodicity 9):
      - `start_year = ((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
    - For the sixth sign (periodicity 18):
      - `start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`

The result matches the expected output, which is 36.

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur for all given test cases based on the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
