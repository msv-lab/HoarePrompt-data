You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program: 
def func():

    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):

        print(start_year)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) indicating the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs.

    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]

            start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        
        print(start_year)
        
    #State: num_tests is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of signs and their respective periodicities. For each test case, it calculates and prints the earliest year in which all signs will be synchronized based on their periodicities.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur given the periodicity of each sign. The signs must occur sequentially, and once a sign occurs, the tribe waits for the next sign to occur strictly after the year of the previous sign.

### Program Analysis

The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of signs and their respective periodicities. It then calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur using the following logic:

1. Initialize `start_year` to 0.
2. For each sign, calculate the next occurrence year as follows:
   - `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`
3. Print the final `start_year` which represents the year the n-th sign will occur.

### Code Review

Let's break down the logic of the code:
- `start_year` starts at 0.
- For each sign, the next occurrence year is calculated by finding the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.
- This is done by the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

### Testing the Program

Let's test the program with the provided example inputs to see if it produces the correct outputs:

#### Example Input 1
```
4
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
5
1 2 3 4 5
5
1 1 1 1 1
6
50 30 711 200 503 1006
```

#### Expected Output
```
36
5
5
2012
```

#### Program Output
Let's simulate the program to verify the output:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Signs: [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]
   - Year 1: Next multiple of 3 is 3
   - Year 4: Next multiple of 2 is 4
   - Year 8: Next multiple of 4 is 8
   - Year 10: Next multiple of 5 is 10
   - Year 18: Next multiple of 9 is 18
   - Year 36: Next multiple of 18 is 36
   - Output: 36 (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Signs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   - Year 1: Next multiple of 1 is 1
   - Year 2: Next multiple of 2 is 2
   - Year 3: Next multiple of 3 is 3
   - Year 4: Next multiple of 4 is 4
   - Year 5: Next multiple of 5 is 5
   - Output: 5 (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Signs: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
   - Year 1: Next multiple of 1 is 1
   - Year 2: Next multiple of 1 is 2
   - Year 3: Next multiple of 1 is 3
   - Year 4: Next multiple of 1 is 4
   - Year 5: Next multiple of 1 is 5
   - Output: 5 (Correct)

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Signs: [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]
   - Year 1: Next multiple of 50 is 50
   - Year 80: Next multiple of 30 is 90
   - Year 1611: Next multiple of 711 is 2133
   - Year 2333: Next multiple of 200 is 2400
   - Year 2836: Next multiple of 503 is 3036
   - Year 4042: Next multiple of 1006 is 5036
   - Output: 2012 (Incorrect, should be 5036)

### Conclusion

The program does not produce the correct output for the fourth test case. The logic seems to be incorrect in handling the calculation of the next occurrence year.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation
The program fails to produce the correct output for at least one of the test cases (the fourth one). The logic for calculating the next occurrence year seems to be flawed, leading to incorrect results.
