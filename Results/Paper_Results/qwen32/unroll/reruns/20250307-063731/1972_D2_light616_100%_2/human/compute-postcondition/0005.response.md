To determine the output of the `print(cnt)` statement, we need to understand the value of `cnt` based on the provided initial state. However, the initial state only mentions "the final value of `cnt` after all iterations," without providing any specific details about how `cnt` is calculated or what its value is.

Given the lack of specific information about how `cnt` is derived, we can only describe the output in terms of the final value of `cnt`.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the final value of cnt after all iterations)**
