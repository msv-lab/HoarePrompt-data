Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

### Program Analysis

The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function reads a single test case and calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for that test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

#### `func_1()` Analysis

The key logic in `func_1()` is the nested loops:
- The outer loop iterates over \(x\) starting from 1 up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
- The inner loop iterates over \(y\) starting from 1 as long as \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).

For each pair \((x, y)\), the program checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If true, it increments the count by the minimum of:
- \(n // ((x + y) \cdot x)\)
- \(m // ((x + y) \cdot y)\)

This logic attempts to count valid pairs by leveraging the properties of coprime numbers and the constraints given in the problem.

#### `func_2()` Analysis

This function simply reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case, which is correct as per the problem description.

### Correctness Verification

To verify the correctness, we need to check if the logic in `func_1()` correctly counts all valid pairs \((a, b)\) for every possible input within the given constraints.

#### Potential Issues

1. **Range of \(x\) and \(y\)**: The outer loop runs up to \(\sqrt{n}\), which is efficient given the constraints. The inner loop condition ensures that the product \((x + y) \cdot x\) and \((x + y) \cdot y\) do not exceed \(n\) and \(m\) respectively.
2. **Coprime Check**: The condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) is necessary for the logic to work correctly. If \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, then the count is incremented based on the minimum of the two divisions.
3. **Counting Logic**: The count is incremented by the minimum of the two divisions, which correctly accounts for the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic correctly counts all valid pairs \((a, b)\) for every possible input within the given constraints. The program efficiently handles the nested loops and correctly applies the conditions specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
