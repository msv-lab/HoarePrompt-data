You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, then calls `func_1` exactly `t` times to process each test case.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

#### `func_1()` Analysis:
- The function reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).
- It initializes a counter `cnt` to 0.
- It iterates over possible values of \(x\) starting from 1 up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
- For each \(x\), it iterates over possible values of \(y\) starting from 1.
- The condition `(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m` ensures that both \(x\) and \(y\) are within the bounds after scaling by \(x + y\).
- If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments the counter `cnt` by the minimum of the number of multiples of \((x + y) * x\) up to \(n\) and the number of multiples of \((x + y) * y\) up to \(m\).

#### Key Points:
- The program only considers pairs \((x, y)\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
- It counts pairs based on the multiples of \((x + y) * x\) and \((x + y) * y\), which is not a comprehensive approach to cover all valid pairs \((a, b)\).

### Flaws in the Program:
- The program does not correctly account for all pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \text{ is a multiple of } a + b\).
- It only considers pairs where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), which excludes pairs where \(\gcd(a, b) > 1\).

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem as it misses valid pairs where \(\gcd(a, b) > 1\).

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
