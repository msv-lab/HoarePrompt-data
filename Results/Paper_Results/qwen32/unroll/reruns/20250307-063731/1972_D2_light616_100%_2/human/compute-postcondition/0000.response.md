The code `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, updating the value of `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, after executing this line, `t` will still be a positive integer, but its specific value will be the one provided by the user input.

Output State: **t is a positive integer provided by the user input, representing the number of test cases.**
