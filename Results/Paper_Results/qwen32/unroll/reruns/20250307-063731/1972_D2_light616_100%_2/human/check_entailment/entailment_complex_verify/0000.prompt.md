You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program: 
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: the final value of `cnt` after all iterations.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: cnt (where cnt is the final value of cnt after all iterations)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and prints the count of pairs \((x, y)\) such that \(x \cdot y\) is coprime, and the product \((x + y) \cdot x\) does not exceed \(n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y\) does not exceed \(m\).

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: t remains the same, and func_1() has been called t times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, then calls `func_1` exactly `t` times to process each test case.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

### Program Analysis

The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function reads a single test case and calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for that test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

#### `func_1()` Analysis

The key logic in `func_1()` is the nested loops:
- The outer loop iterates over \(x\) starting from 1 up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
- The inner loop iterates over \(y\) starting from 1 as long as \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).

For each pair \((x, y)\), the program checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If true, it increments the count by the minimum of:
- \(n // ((x + y) \cdot x)\)
- \(m // ((x + y) \cdot y)\)

This logic attempts to count valid pairs by leveraging the properties of coprime numbers and the constraints given in the problem.

#### `func_2()` Analysis

This function simply reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case, which is correct as per the problem description.

### Correctness Verification

To verify the correctness, we need to check if the logic in `func_1()` correctly counts all valid pairs \((a, b)\) for every possible input within the given constraints.

#### Potential Issues

1. **Range of \(x\) and \(y\)**: The outer loop runs up to \(\sqrt{n}\), which is efficient given the constraints. The inner loop condition ensures that the product \((x + y) \cdot x\) and \((x + y) \cdot y\) do not exceed \(n\) and \(m\) respectively.
2. **Coprime Check**: The condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) is necessary for the logic to work correctly. If \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, then the count is incremented based on the minimum of the two divisions.
3. **Counting Logic**: The count is incremented by the minimum of the two divisions, which correctly accounts for the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic correctly counts all valid pairs \((a, b)\) for every possible input within the given constraints. The program efficiently handles the nested loops and correctly applies the conditions specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
