### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotations to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

#### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

#### `func_1()` Analysis:
- The function reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).
- It initializes a counter `cnt` to 0.
- It iterates over possible values of \(x\) starting from 1 up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
- For each \(x\), it iterates over possible values of \(y\) starting from 1.
- The condition `(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m` ensures that both \(x\) and \(y\) are within the bounds after scaling by \(x + y\).
- If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments the counter `cnt` by the minimum of the number of multiples of \((x + y) * x\) up to \(n\) and the number of multiples of \((x + y) * y\) up to \(m\).

#### Key Points:
- The program only considers pairs \((x, y)\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
- It counts pairs based on the multiples of \((x + y) * x\) and \((x + y) * y\), which is not a comprehensive approach to cover all valid pairs \((a, b)\).

#### Flaws in the Program:
- The program does not correctly account for all pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \text{ is a multiple of } a + b\).
- It only considers pairs where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), which excludes pairs where \(\gcd(a, b) > 1\).

### Annotations:
The annotations provide insights into the program's state at key points:
- Before `func_1()` is called, \(n\) and \(m\) are positive integers within the given constraints.
- The program iterates through values of \(x\) and \(y\) and checks the conditions.
- The final value of `cnt` is printed, representing the number of valid pairs.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identifies the flaw in the program. The program's logic is too restrictive by only considering pairs where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). It misses pairs where \(\gcd(a, b) > 1\), which are valid according to the problem statement.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Final: False**
