The provided function `func_1` does not accept any parameters according to the given code snippet. Therefore, we need to describe its functionality based solely on the output details provided.

Output:
- The function does not accept any parameters.
- It seems there might be a discrepancy as the function is named `func_1` but the parameter constraints mention `n` and `m`. Assuming the function is supposed to accept `n` and `m` as described, we will proceed with that assumption.

Given the constraints and the typical structure of such problems, let's assume the function is supposed to accept `n` and `m` and then describe its functionality based on the provided output cases:

Parameter constraints: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
```
def func_1(n, m):
```
Output:
- Case_1: If `n` is less than `m`, the function returns `n`.
- Case_2: If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, the function returns `m`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m`. If `n` is less than `m`, it returns `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it returns `m`.**
