### Reasoning:

The program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. Here's a breakdown of their roles and how they attempt to solve the problem:

1. **Function `func_1`:**

   - **Purpose:** To calculate the number of valid ordered pairs \((x, y)\) for a given \(n\) and \(m\) that satisfy the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
   
   - **Implementation Details:**
     - The function initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
     - It iterates through possible values of `x` such that \(x^2 \leq n\).
     - For each `x`, it iterates through possible values of `y` such that \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
     - If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).
     - Finally, it prints the value of `cnt`.

   - **Issues:**
     - The function is named `func_1` but the problem description suggests a different approach to solving the problem. The given implementation does not correctly address the problem statement. Specifically, it does not correctly count the pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
     - The loop conditions and the way `cnt` is incremented do not align with the problem's requirements.

2. **Function `func_2`:**

   - **Purpose:** To handle multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.
   
   - **Implementation Details:**
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - It calls `func_1` `t` times to process each test case.
   
   - **Issues:**
     - Since `func_1` is not correctly implemented, `func_2` will also not produce the correct results.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic and implementation in `func_1` do not align with the problem requirements, leading to incorrect results.

**Correctness: False**
