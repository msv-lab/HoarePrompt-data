To determine the output state, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and the function `func_1`. Since `func_1` is not defined in the provided code snippet, we can only make assumptions based on the given loop structure.

Given:
- `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.
- The loop `for _ in range(t):` will execute `func_1()` exactly `t` times.

Since `func_1()` is not defined, we cannot determine what specific actions it performs, but we can infer that the loop will run `t` times, and `func_1()` will be called `t` times.

The variable `_` is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use. It will simply take on the values from `0` to `t-1` during each iteration of the loop, but since it's not used in the loop body, its value is irrelevant to the output state.

Therefore, the only change in the output state will be the number of times `func_1()` has been called, which is `t` times.

Since we are not given any other variables that are affected by `func_1()`, we can only describe the state of `t` and the fact that `func_1()` has been called `t` times.

Output State: **t remains the same, and func_1() has been called t times.**
