### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations.

#### Problem Recap
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

#### Program Analysis

The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: Processes a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: Handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each.

#### `func_1()` Analysis

The key logic is in the nested loops:
- **Outer Loop**: Iterates \(x\) from 1 up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
- **Inner Loop**: Iterates \(y\) from 1 while \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) * y \le m\).

For each pair \((x, y)\):
- Checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
- If true, increments the count by the minimum of:
  - \(n // ((x + y) * x)\)
  - \(m // ((x + y) * y)\)

#### Annotations and Code Validation

Annotations state:
- **State before `func_1()`**: \(n\) and \(m\) are positive integers within the given constraints.
- **State after `func_1()`**: The final count `cnt` is printed, representing the number of valid pairs.
- **State before `func_2()`**: \(t\) is the number of test cases.
- **State after `func_2()`**: `func_1()` has been called \(t\) times.

#### Correctness Verification

1. **Range of \(x\) and \(y\)**:
   - The outer loop runs up to \(\sqrt{n}\), which is efficient given \(n \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
   - The inner loop ensures \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\), preventing overflow.

2. **Coprime Check**:
   - The condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) is crucial. If \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, the logic counts pairs correctly.

3. **Counting Logic**:
   - The count is incremented by the minimum of the two divisions. This logic aims to count valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

#### Potential Issues

The original assessment suggests the logic is correct. However, let's cross-check with the problem statement:
- The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) is not directly addressed by the current logic.
- The current logic seems to count pairs based on coprime condition and the divisions, which might not directly translate to the given problem condition.

#### Detailed Examination

The current logic counts pairs where:
- \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime.
- The count is incremented based on the minimum number of times \((x + y) \cdot x\) fits into \(n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y\) fits into \(m\).

However, the problem requires:
- \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) to be a multiple of \(a + b\).

The provided logic does not directly ensure that \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\). The logic seems to be an attempt to count pairs based on coprime conditions and divisibility, but it does not guarantee that the pairs satisfy the specific condition required by the problem.

### Conclusion

The original assessment may have overlooked the specific condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\). The current logic does not directly address this condition, which is crucial for correctness.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
