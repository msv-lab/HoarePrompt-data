The provided function `func_2` does not accept any parameters according to the given code snippet. However, the problem statement mentions that `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, which implies that `t` should be an input to the function. Given the constraints and the format of the previous examples, we can infer that `t` should be passed as a parameter to the function.

Based on the output description, we need to handle multiple test cases, and the function should behave differently based on the value of `t`. However, the specific behavior for each test case is not described in the provided information. For the sake of this task, we will describe the functionality based on the given constraints and the format of the previous examples.

Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4. The function processes `t` test cases and returns the appropriate result for each case based on the conditions specified for each test case.**
