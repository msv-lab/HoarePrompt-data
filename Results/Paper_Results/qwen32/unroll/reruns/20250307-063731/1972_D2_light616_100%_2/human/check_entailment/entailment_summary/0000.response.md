Reasoning: The provided code consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. The main function `func_2` reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it calls `func_1`. The function `func_1` is responsible for calculating the number of valid ordered pairs \((a, b)\) for a single test case based on the given conditions.

The function `func_1` iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(x \cdot y\) is coprime, and the product \((x + y) \cdot x\) does not exceed \(n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y\) does not exceed \(m\). It then counts the valid pairs by considering the constraints and using the greatest common divisor (gcd) function to check if \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime.

However, the code does not fully meet the problem's requirements. The condition to check is that \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\). The provided `func_1` does not directly check this condition. Instead, it checks if \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime and counts pairs based on that, which is not equivalent to the problem's condition.

To correctly solve the problem, `func_1` should iterate over possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\). The current implementation does not perform this check, and thus, it does not correctly solve the problem.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
