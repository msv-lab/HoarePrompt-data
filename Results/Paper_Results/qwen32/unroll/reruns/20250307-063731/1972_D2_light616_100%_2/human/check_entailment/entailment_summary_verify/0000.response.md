### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its logic to ensure it correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Problem Recap

We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

#### Program Analysis

The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function reads a single test case and calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for that test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

##### `func_1()` Analysis

The key logic in `func_1()` involves nested loops:
- The outer loop iterates over \(x\) from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\).
- The inner loop iterates over \(y\) from 1 as long as \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).

For each pair \((x, y)\), if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), the program increments the count by the minimum of:
- \(n // ((x + y) \cdot x)\)
- \(m // ((x + y) \cdot y)\)

This logic is intended to count valid pairs by leveraging the properties of coprime numbers and the constraints given in the problem.

##### `func_2()` Analysis

This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case, which is correct as per the problem description.

#### Correctness Verification

To verify the correctness, we need to ensure that the logic in `func_1()` correctly counts all valid pairs \((a, b)\) for every possible input within the given constraints.

##### Potential Issues

1. **Range of \(x\) and \(y\)**: The outer loop runs up to \(\sqrt{n}\), which is efficient given the constraints. The inner loop condition ensures that the product \((x + y) \cdot x\) and \((x + y) \cdot y\) do not exceed \(n\) and \(m\) respectively.
2. **Coprime Check**: The condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) is necessary for the logic to work correctly. If \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, then the count is incremented based on the minimum of the two divisions.
3. **Counting Logic**: The count is incremented by the minimum of the two divisions, which correctly accounts for the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

However, there is a critical issue with the logic in `func_1()`. The logic assumes that for each pair \((x, y)\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), the valid pairs \((a, b)\) are counted by the minimum of the two divisions. This assumption is incorrect because it does not correctly enumerate all valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) = 0\).

The logic should enumerate all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition directly, rather than relying on the coprime property and the divisions.

#### Correct Approach

A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition directly:
```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (b * math.gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
```

This approach directly checks the condition for each pair \((a, b)\), ensuring that all valid pairs are counted correctly.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the original program does not correctly count all valid pairs \((a, b)\) for every possible input within the given constraints. The logic in `func_1()` is flawed and does not correctly enumerate all valid pairs.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
