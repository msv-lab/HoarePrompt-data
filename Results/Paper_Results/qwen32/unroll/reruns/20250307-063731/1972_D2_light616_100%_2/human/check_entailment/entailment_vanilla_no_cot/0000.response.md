Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The main issue lies in the logic of the `func_1` function, which is supposed to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) for a single test case. The current implementation does not correctly iterate through all possible pairs (a, b) and check the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0`.

Here is a brief explanation of the problem and a correct approach:

1. **Problem Recap**: We need to find all pairs (a, b) such that:
   - 1 ≤ a ≤ n
   - 1 ≤ b ≤ m
   - b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b

2. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each pair (a, b) in the range, we need to check the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0`.
   - The provided program attempts to optimize by iterating through multiples of x and y, but it does not cover all possible pairs and incorrectly calculates the count of valid pairs.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (b * math.gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

# Example usage
# func_2()
```

This corrected version iterates through all possible pairs (a, b) and checks the condition directly, which is feasible given the constraints (sum of n and m does not exceed 2 * 10^6). The original program's logic is flawed and does not correctly count the valid pairs.
