Functionality: **The function `func_5` accepts parameters `n` and `q` as integers where `2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5`. It also accepts a list `a` of integers of length `n` where each integer is in the range `0 <= a_i < 2^30`. Additionally, it accepts integers `l` and `r` where `1 <= l < r <= n`. The function performs operations based on these inputs and returns some result, but the specific operations and return values are not detailed here.**
