### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine if a given subarray can be divided into two or more parts with equal XOR values. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - `func_1` reads integers from the input, which is used to parse the number of test cases, the size of the array, the number of queries, and the elements of the array.

2. **Cumulative XOR Calculation:**
   - `func_5` computes the cumulative XOR values for the array. This is stored in the list `x`, where `x[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`.
   - It also maintains a dictionary `inds` that maps each unique XOR value to the list of indices where that XOR value appears in `x`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query defined by `l` and `r`, the program checks if the subarray `a[l-1:r]` can be split into two or more parts with equal XOR values.
   - If `x[l-1] == x[r]`, it implies that the entire subarray `a[l-1:r]` has an XOR value of `0`, which means it can trivially be split into parts with equal XOR values (all parts having an XOR of `0`).
   - If `x[l-1] != x[r]`, the program uses the `inds` dictionary to find indices where the XOR value `x[r]` appears before `l` and where the XOR value `x[l-1]` appears at or after `r`. If there is an index `lower` where `x[r]` appears before `l` and an index `upper` where `x[l-1]` appears at or after `r` such that `upper > lower`, it means there exists a split point in the subarray `a[l-1:r]` where the XOR values of the two parts are equal.

4. **Binary Search for Indices:**
   - `func_2` and `func_4` perform binary search operations on the list of indices stored in `inds` to find the appropriate `lower` and `upper` indices.
   - `func_2` finds the largest index less than a given value that satisfies a predicate.
   - `func_4` finds the smallest index greater than or equal to a given value that satisfies a predicate and adds 1 to it.

5. **Output:**
   - For each query, the program prints "Yes" if the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values, otherwise it prints "No".

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values using cumulative XOR values and binary search on indices. The functions are correctly defined and used in the context of the problem.

**Correctness: True**
