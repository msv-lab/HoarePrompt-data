Output State: **`n` and `q` are integers returned by `func_1(int)`, with `2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5`; `a` is a new list of integers of length `n` returned by `func_1`; `l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l < r <= n`; `x` is a list containing a single element, `0`; `inds` is a defaultdict of lists.**

Explanation: The code initializes `inds` as a defaultdict of lists, but it does not affect the values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, `r`, or `x`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for these variables, with the addition of `inds` being initialized.
