### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to determine whether a given subarray of an array is "interesting" based on the criteria that the subarray can be divided into two or more parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.

Here's a breakdown of the program's approach and correctness:

1. **Cumulative XOR Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the cumulative XOR of the array elements and stores these values in the list `x`. Specifically, `x[i]` represents the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to the `i-1`th element.
   - The cumulative XOR helps in determining the XOR of any subarray efficiently. For a subarray from index `l` to `r`, the XOR can be calculated as `x[r] ^ x[l-1]`.

2. **Index Mapping**:
   - A dictionary `inds` maps each cumulative XOR value to a list of indices where that XOR value appears in the `x` list.
   - This mapping helps in quickly finding indices where a specific cumulative XOR value occurs, which is crucial for efficiently answering the queries.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program checks if the cumulative XOR of the subarray `a[l-1:r]` is `0` (i.e., `x[r] == x[l-1]`). If it is, the subarray can be trivially divided into two equal parts with XOR `0`.
   - If the cumulative XOR is not `0`, the program uses binary search (via `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4`) to find indices in `inds` where the cumulative XOR values match and fall within the subarray bounds. Specifically:
     - `lower` is the largest index less than `l` where the cumulative XOR matches `x[r]`.
     - `upper` is the smallest index greater than or equal to `l` where the cumulative XOR matches `x[l-1]`.
   - If `upper` is greater than `lower`, it means there exists a valid division of the subarray into two or more parts with equal XOR values, and the program outputs "Yes". Otherwise, it outputs "No".

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting by leveraging cumulative XOR values and efficient binary search. The use of cumulative XOR allows for quick computation of subarray XOR values, and the index mapping along with binary search ensures that the program can efficiently answer each query within the given constraints.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the approach seems sound and the implementation appears to handle all edge cases correctly.

**Correctness: True**
