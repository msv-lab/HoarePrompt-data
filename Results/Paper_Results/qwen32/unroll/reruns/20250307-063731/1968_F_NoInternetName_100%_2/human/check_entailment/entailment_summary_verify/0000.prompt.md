You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

from collections import defaultdict

    while l + 1 < r:

        if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
            print('Yes')
            continue
        lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]
        upper = inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]
        if upper > lower:

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function `func_5` processes a list of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines whether a specific subarray can be partitioned into two non-empty subarrays with equal XOR values. It prints "Yes" if such a partition is possible for the subarray defined by the query, otherwise it prints "No".+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases and potential scenarios as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining whether a subarray is "interesting" is flawed.

Let's analyze the code:

1. The program calculates the cumulative XOR values of the array and stores them in the list `x`. This is correct up to this point.

2. It also maintains a dictionary `inds` to store the indices where each cumulative XOR value appears.

3. The main logic for checking if a subarray `a[l:r+1]` is interesting involves checking if `x[r] == x[l-1]` or if there exists an index `lower` in `inds[x[r]]` and an index `upper` in `inds[x[l-1]]` such that `lower < l` and `upper > r`.

4. The functions `func_3` and `func_4` are used to find the appropriate indices in `inds[x[r]]` and `inds[x[l-1]]` respectively. However, the way these functions are implemented can lead to incorrect results.

Specifically, the issue lies in the use of binary search (`func_2`) to find the appropriate indices. The predicates used in these functions (`lambda arg: arg < l` and `lambda arg: arg <= r`) are not correctly applied to find the indices that satisfy the conditions for the subarray to be interesting.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

Consider the input:
```
1
5 1
1 1 2 3 0
1 5
```
The output should be `YES` because the subarray `[1, 1, 2, 3, 0]` can be split into `[1]`, `[1]`, and `[2, 3, 0]` where the XOR of each part is `1`.

However, the program might incorrectly determine this as `NO` due to the flawed logic in finding the indices `lower` and `upper`.

To fix this, the logic for finding the appropriate indices should be corrected, ensuring that the indices found satisfy the conditions for the subarray to be interesting.

Since the current implementation does not handle all cases correctly, the program is incorrect.
