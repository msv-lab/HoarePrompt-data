Output State: **`n` and `q` are integers returned by `func_1(int)`, with `2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5`; `a` is a new list of integers of length `n` returned by `func_1`; `l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l < r <= n`; `x` is a list containing a single element, `0`; `inds` is a defaultdict of lists with `inds[0]` containing the single element `0`.**

Natural language: The value of `inds[0]` has been updated to contain the single element `0`. All other variables (`n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
