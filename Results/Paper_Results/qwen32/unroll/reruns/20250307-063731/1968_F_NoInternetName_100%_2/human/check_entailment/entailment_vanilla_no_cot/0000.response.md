Correctness: **False**

The given program is not correct for the problem described. Here's why:

The program uses a binary search approach to try to find suitable indices in the list of cumulative XOR values (`inds`). However, the logic for determining whether a subarray is interesting is flawed.

The core idea of the solution should be to check if there exists a way to split the subarray into `k > 1` parts such that the XOR of each part is equal. To do this efficiently, we need to ensure that the cumulative XOR values of the subarray can be partitioned in such a way.

The current implementation incorrectly uses binary search on the indices of cumulative XOR values, but it does not correctly handle the condition that the subarray can be split into `k > 1` parts with equal XOR values.

A correct approach would involve checking if the cumulative XOR of the subarray is zero (which means the XOR of the entire subarray is zero, a necessary condition for it to be split into parts with equal XOR), and then checking if there are enough indices in the `inds` dictionary to partition the subarray correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the `func_5` function that should work:

```python
def func_5():
    (n, q) = func_1(int)
    a = list(func_1(int))
    x = [0]
    inds = defaultdict(list)
    inds[0].append(0)
    for i in a:
        x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
        inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)
    for i in range(q):
        (l, r) = func_1(int)
        xor_lr = x[r] ^ x[l - 1]
        if xor_lr == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            found = False
            for k in range(2, r - l + 2):
                if xor_lr % k == 0:
                    sub_xor = xor_lr // k
                    current_xor = 0
                    count = 0
                    for j in range(l - 1, r):
                        current_xor ^= a[j]
                        if current_xor == sub_xor:
                            count += 1
                            current_xor = 0
                            if count == k:
                                found = True
                                break
                    if found:
                        break
            if found:
                print('Yes')
            else:
                print('No')
```

This corrected version checks if the XOR of the subarray is zero and then tries to partition the subarray into `k` parts with equal XOR values. If it finds such a partition, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".
