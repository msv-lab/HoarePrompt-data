The code snippet provided is `n, q = func_1(int)`. This line suggests that the function `func_1` is called with `int` as an argument, and the function returns two values which are then assigned to `n` and `q`.

Given the initial state, `n` and `q` are integers, and the function `func_1` is expected to return two integers. However, the function `func_1` and its behavior are not defined in the provided context. Therefore, we can only infer that `n` and `q` will take on whatever values are returned by `func_1(int)`.

Since the function `func_1` is not specified, let's assume that `func_1(int)` returns two integers, and these integers could be any valid integers within the constraints provided for `n` and `q` in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are integers returned by `func_1(int)`, with `2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each integer is in the range `0 <= a_i < 2^30`, `l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l < r <= n`.**
