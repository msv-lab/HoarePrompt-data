The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and q, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5. This is followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30. Then, q lines follow, each containing two integers l and r (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) representing a query. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
