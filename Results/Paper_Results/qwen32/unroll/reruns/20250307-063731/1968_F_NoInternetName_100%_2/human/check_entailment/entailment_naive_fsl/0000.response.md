Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases and potential scenarios as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining whether a subarray is "interesting" is flawed.

Let's analyze the code:

1. The program calculates the cumulative XOR values of the array and stores them in the list `x`. This is correct up to this point.

2. It also maintains a dictionary `inds` to store the indices where each cumulative XOR value appears.

3. The main logic for checking if a subarray `a[l:r+1]` is interesting involves checking if `x[r] == x[l-1]` or if there exists an index `lower` in `inds[x[r]]` and an index `upper` in `inds[x[l-1]]` such that `lower < l` and `upper > r`.

4. The functions `func_3` and `func_4` are used to find the appropriate indices in `inds[x[r]]` and `inds[x[l-1]]` respectively. However, the way these functions are implemented can lead to incorrect results.

Specifically, the issue lies in the use of binary search (`func_2`) to find the appropriate indices. The predicates used in these functions (`lambda arg: arg < l` and `lambda arg: arg <= r`) are not correctly applied to find the indices that satisfy the conditions for the subarray to be interesting.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

Consider the input:
```
1
5 1
1 1 2 3 0
1 5
```
The output should be `YES` because the subarray `[1, 1, 2, 3, 0]` can be split into `[1]`, `[1]`, and `[2, 3, 0]` where the XOR of each part is `1`.

However, the program might incorrectly determine this as `NO` due to the flawed logic in finding the indices `lower` and `upper`.

To fix this, the logic for finding the appropriate indices should be corrected, ensuring that the indices found satisfy the conditions for the subarray to be interesting.

Since the current implementation does not handle all cases correctly, the program is incorrect.
