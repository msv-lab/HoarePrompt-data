You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze each part of the code step-by-step:

### Problem Understanding

The problem requires determining whether a given subarray of an array can be split into more than one part such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.

### Code Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The function `func_1` reads a line of input and converts it to a list of integers.
   - The main function `func_5` reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array) and `q` (number of queries), followed by the array elements and then the queries.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The array `x` is initialized with a single element `0`.
   - For each element in the input array `a`, the corresponding prefix XOR is computed and appended to `x`.
   - A dictionary `inds` keeps track of the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.

3. **Binary Search Helper Functions:**
   - `func_2` and `func_3` perform binary search to find the largest index where a given predicate is true.
   - `func_4` performs a similar binary search but returns the index + 1 if the predicate is true.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query `(l, r)`, the program first checks if `x[l-1] == x[r]`. If true, it prints "YES" because the entire subarray has a XOR of `0`, which can trivially be split into any number of parts with XOR `0`.
   - If the above condition is not met, it uses the `inds` dictionary to find the largest index `lower` in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` and the smallest index `upper` in `inds[x[l-1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
   - If `upper > lower`, it means there is a valid split point within the subarray, and it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Evaluation

The logic used in the code is based on the prefix XOR values and their indices. The key idea is that if there are two indices `i` and `j` (with `i < j`) such that `x[i] == x[j]`, then the subarray `a[i+1]` to `a[j]` has a XOR of `0`. This subarray can be split into any number of parts with XOR `0`.

The binary search functions help in efficiently finding the required indices within the `inds` dictionary. The logic for determining the "interesting" subarray is sound and follows the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
