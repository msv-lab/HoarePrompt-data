You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and q are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, a is a list of integers of length n where each integer is in the range 0 <= a_i < 2^30, l and r are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n.
def func_5():
    n, q = func_1(int)
    a = list(func_1(int))
    x = [0]
    inds = defaultdict(list)
    inds[0].append(0)
    for i in a:
        x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
        
        inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)
        
    #State: `x` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative XOR result up to that point, starting with `0`. `inds` is a defaultdict where each key is a unique XOR result found in `x`, and the value is a list of indices in `x` where that result appears.
    for i in range(q):
        l, r = func_1(int)
        
        if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
            print('Yes')
            continue
        
        lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]
        
        upper = inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]
        
        if upper > lower:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: `x` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative XOR result up to that point, starting with `0`. `inds` is a defaultdict where each key is a unique XOR result found in `x`, and the value is a list of indices in `x` where that result appears.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_5` accepts parameters `n` and `q` as integers where `2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5`. It also accepts a list `a` of integers of length `n` where each integer is in the range `0 <= a_i < 2^30`. Additionally, it accepts integers `l` and `r` where `1 <= l < r <= n`. The function performs operations based on these inputs and returns some result, but the specific operations and return values are not detailed here.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
