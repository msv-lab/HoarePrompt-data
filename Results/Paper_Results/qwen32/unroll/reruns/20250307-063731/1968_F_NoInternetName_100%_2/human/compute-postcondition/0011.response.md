Functionality: **The function `func_5` processes a list of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines whether a specific subarray can be partitioned into two non-empty subarrays with equal XOR values. It prints "Yes" if such a partition is possible for the subarray defined by the query, otherwise it prints "No".**
