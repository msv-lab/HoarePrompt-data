To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze each part of the code step-by-step:

### Problem Understanding

The problem requires determining whether a given subarray of an array can be split into more than one part such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.

### Code Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The function `func_1` reads a line of input and converts it to a list of integers.
   - The main function `func_5` reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array) and `q` (number of queries), followed by the array elements and then the queries.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The array `x` is initialized with a single element `0`.
   - For each element in the input array `a`, the corresponding prefix XOR is computed and appended to `x`.
   - A dictionary `inds` keeps track of the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.

3. **Binary Search Helper Functions:**
   - `func_2` and `func_3` perform binary search to find the largest index where a given predicate is true.
   - `func_4` performs a similar binary search but returns the index + 1 if the predicate is true.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query `(l, r)`, the program first checks if `x[l-1] == x[r]`. If true, it prints "YES" because the entire subarray has a XOR of `0`, which can trivially be split into any number of parts with XOR `0`.
   - If the above condition is not met, it uses the `inds` dictionary to find the largest index `lower` in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` and the smallest index `upper` in `inds[x[l-1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
   - If `upper > lower`, it means there is a valid split point within the subarray, and it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Evaluation

The logic used in the code is based on the prefix XOR values and their indices. The key idea is that if there are two indices `i` and `j` (with `i < j`) such that `x[i] == x[j]`, then the subarray `a[i+1]` to `a[j]` has a XOR of `0`. This subarray can be split into any number of parts with XOR `0`.

The binary search functions help in efficiently finding the required indices within the `inds` dictionary. The logic for determining the "interesting" subarray is sound and follows the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
