Functionality: **The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d` with integer keys and lists of integers as values, a list of integers `processing`, an integer `da`, and a list of integers `rank`. The function returns 1 if a specific condition is met. Otherwise, it returns `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value returned by recursive calls to `func_12` with updated parameters. Specifically, `tmp` is determined by calling `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0.**
