### Reasoning:

To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze the problem requirements and the logic implemented in the code.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. For each test case, given two integers `n` and `m`, find the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that:
   - \(1 \le a \le n\)
   - \(1 \le b \le m\)
   - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The code consists of several functions, but the main function that seems relevant to solving the problem is `func_15()`. The function `func_16()` calls `func_15()` for each test case and prints the result.

Here's the relevant part of `func_15()`:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

### Analysis of `func_15()`:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs while `i * i <= n + i`. This condition does not directly relate to the problem's requirements. It seems to be an attempt to iterate over possible values of `a` or `b`, but it is not clear how it relates to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
2. **Accumulation Logic**: Inside the loop, `ans` is incremented by `(n + i) // (i * i)`. This logic does not correctly check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The expression `(n + i) // (i * i)` does not represent the count of valid pairs `(a, b)`.
3. **Return Value**: The function returns `ans - 1`, which is not aligned with the problem's requirement to count valid pairs.

### Function Summary:
The function summary provided states that `func_16` prints the number 1, `m` times, each on a new line. This is clearly incorrect based on the problem requirements, as the output should be the number of valid pairs for each test case, not a fixed number.

### Example:
Let's consider the first test case from the problem statement:
- Input: `n = 1`, `m = 1`
- Expected Output: `1` (only the pair (1, 1) satisfies the condition)

The provided code does not correctly handle this case or any other case as it does not properly implement the logic to check the conditions specified in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness is False.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
