Correctness: **False**

The provided program includes multiple functions, but the function `func_16()` is the one that seems to be intended for solving the problem. However, `func_16()` calls `func_15()`, which does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

The function `func_15()` calculates a certain value based on the input `n` and `m`, but it does not correctly count the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The logic in `func_15()` is unrelated to the problem requirements.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should iterate through all possible pairs `(a, b)` for each test case and count those that satisfy the condition `a + b % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0`. Given the constraints, an efficient approach is needed to avoid a time complexity that would lead to a timeout.

Here is a corrected version of the program that should solve the problem correctly:

```python
import sys
import math

def gcd(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
    return x

def solve(n, m):
    count = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        m = int(input[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(solve(n, m))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This program reads the input, processes each test case by iterating through all pairs `(a, b)`, and counts those that satisfy the given condition. It then prints the results for each test case. Note that this solution may not be efficient enough for the upper constraints (`n, m` up to `2 * 10^6`), and further optimization would be necessary for such cases.
