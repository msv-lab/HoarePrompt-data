The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, and two positive integers `n` and `m`. It also takes an integer `k`. It reduces `k` by the sum of `(m - a[i])` for each element `a[i]` in the list `a` that is less than `m`. If the resulting `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.
