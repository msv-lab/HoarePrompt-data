Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The core logic for calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions is missing or incorrect. The function `func_15()` seems to be an attempt at solving the problem, but its logic is not aligned with the problem statement.

Let's break down the problem requirements and the provided code:

### Problem Requirements:
1. For each test case, given two integers `n` and `m`, find the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that:
   - \(1 \le a \le n\)
   - \(1 \le b \le m\)
   - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Provided Code:
The code contains multiple functions, but the one that seems relevant to solving the problem is `func_15()`. However, the logic inside `func_15()` does not correctly implement the required conditions. Here is the relevant part of `func_15()`:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs while `i * i <= n + i`. This condition does not directly relate to the problem's requirements.
2. **Accumulation Logic**: Inside the loop, `ans` is incremented by `(n + i) // (i * i)`. This logic does not correctly check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
3. **Return Value**: The function returns `ans - 1`, which is not aligned with the problem's requirement to count valid pairs.

### Example:
Let's consider the first test case from the problem statement:
- Input: `n = 1`, `m = 1`
- Expected Output: `1` (only the pair (1, 1) satisfies the condition)

The provided code does not correctly handle this case or any other case as it does not properly implement the logic to check the conditions specified in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness is False.
