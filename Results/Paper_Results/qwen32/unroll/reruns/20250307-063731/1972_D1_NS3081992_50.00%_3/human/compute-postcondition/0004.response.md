To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to understand the loop's behavior. The loop iterates while `i * i` is less than or equal to `n + i`. In each iteration, it increments `ans` by the integer division of `n + i` by `i * i` and then increments `i` by 1.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `i` is initialized to 1.
   - `ans` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop continues as long as `i * i` is less than or equal to `n + i`.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - In each iteration, `ans` is incremented by the value of `(n + i) // (i * i)`.
   - `i` is then incremented by 1.

4. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when `i * i` exceeds `n + i`.

To find the final value of `ans`, we need to sum up the values of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` starting from 1 until `i * i` exceeds `n + i`.

Let's denote the final value of `ans` as `ans_final`.

**Output State**: **the output state you calculate.**

To provide a concrete example, let's assume `n` and `m` are specific values returned by `func_7()`. For the sake of this explanation, let's assume `n = 10` and `m = 15` (though `m` is not used in the loop).

**Calculation for n = 10**:

- **Iteration 1**: `i = 1`
  - `i * i = 1` which is less than or equal to `n + i = 11`.
  - `ans += (10 + 1) // (1 * 1) = 11`
  - `ans = 11`
  - `i += 1` → `i = 2`

- **Iteration 2**: `i = 2`
  - `i * i = 4` which is less than or equal to `n + i = 12`.
  - `ans += (10 + 2) // (2 * 2) = 12 // 4 = 3`
  - `ans = 14`
  - `i += 1` → `i = 3`

- **Iteration 3**: `i = 3`
  - `i * i = 9` which is less than or equal to `n + i = 13`.
  - `ans += (10 + 3) // (3 * 3) = 13 // 9 = 1`
  - `ans = 15`
  - `i += 1` → `i = 4`

- **Iteration 4**: `i = 4`
  - `i * i = 16` which is greater than `n + i = 14`.
  - The loop terminates.

Thus, the final value of `ans` is `15`.

**Output State: **ans = 15, i = 4.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations with `n = 10` and `m = 15`, the variable `ans` will be `15` and `i` will be `4`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
