### Reasoning:

The given program is structured with multiple utility functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, etc.) that handle input and output operations. However, the core logic for solving the problem is contained within `func_15` and `func_16`.

Let's analyze the core logic:

1. **Function `func_15`**:
   - It reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates while `i * i <= n + i`, incrementing `i` in each iteration.
   - In each iteration, it adds `(n + i) // (i * i)` to `ans`.
   - It finally returns `ans - 1`.

2. **Function `func_16`**:
   - It reads the number of test cases using `func_10`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_15` and prints the result.

The logic in `func_15` is incorrect for the given problem. The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 <= a <= n`, `1 <= b <= m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, `func_15` does not implement this logic. Instead, it performs a calculation involving `i` and `n` that is unrelated to the problem requirements.

The provided test cases and their expected output do not match the behavior of `func_15`. For example, the first test case `(1, 1)` should output `1` because the only pair `(1, 1)` satisfies the condition. However, `func_15` does not correctly compute this.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because `func_15` does not implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
