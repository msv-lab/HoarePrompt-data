The function `drank` is not directly related to the problem description provided. However, based on the problem description, the input variables are two positive integers `n` and `m` for each test case. There are `t` test cases, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. For each test case, `1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6`. The sum of `n` and the sum of `m` over all test cases do not exceed `2 * 10^6`.
