To determine the output state after the loop executes all its iterations, we need to understand the functions `func_10()` and `func_15()`. However, since these functions are not defined in the given code snippet, I'll make reasonable assumptions about their behavior based on typical use cases in such problems.

### Assumptions:
1. **`func_10()`**: This function likely returns the number of iterations the loop should perform. Given the context, it could simply return `m` or `n` or a combination of both. For simplicity, let's assume `func_10()` returns `m`, meaning the loop will run `m` times.
2. **`func_15()`**: This function likely returns a value that gets printed in each iteration. For simplicity, let's assume `func_15()` returns a constant value, say `1`, in each iteration.

### Loop Execution:
- The loop will run `m` times.
- In each iteration, `sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')` will be executed, which prints the value returned by `func_15()` followed by a newline.

### Output:
Given our assumptions, the loop will print the number `1` on each of the `m` lines.

### Output State:
Since the values of `n` and `m` are not altered by the loop, they remain the same. The output of the loop is the printed values, which are not variables but rather the result of the print statements.

Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6. The loop prints the number 1, m times, each on a new line.**
