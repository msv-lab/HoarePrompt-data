Reasoning: The given program is designed to solve a specific problem, but the functions provided do not correctly implement the solution for the problem described. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

2. **Functions Analysis**:
   - **Input Reading Functions**: Functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, `func_7`, `func_8`, `func_9`, `func_10`, and `func_11` are primarily for reading input from standard input. These functions seem to be correctly implemented for their intended purposes.
   - **GCD Calculation**: Function `func_13` correctly computes the GCD and the coefficients of Bézout's identity, which could be useful for the problem.
   - **Other Functions**: Functions `func_12`, `func_14`, `func_15`, and `func_16` are not relevant to the problem or are incorrectly implemented for the problem at hand.
     - **Function `func_15`**: This function always returns 14, which is not related to the problem requirements.
     - **Function `func_16`**: This function should process each test case by calling a function that correctly solves the problem, but it instead calls `func_15`, which does not solve the problem.

3. **Correct Implementation**: To solve the problem correctly, a function should iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) and check if the condition a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b) holds. This condition can be simplified to checking if (a / gcd(a, b) + 1) is an integer multiple of b / gcd(a, b).

4. **Conclusion**: Since the functions `func_15` and `func_16` do not implement the correct logic to solve the problem, the program as a whole is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
