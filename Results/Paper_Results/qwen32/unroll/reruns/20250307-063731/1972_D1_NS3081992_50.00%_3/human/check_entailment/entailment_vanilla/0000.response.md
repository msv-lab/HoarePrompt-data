Reasoning:

The given problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

Let's analyze the provided code to see if it correctly solves the problem.

The code contains multiple utility functions for input and output, but the core function responsible for solving the problem is `func_15`. This function calculates the number of valid pairs for a given n and m.

The logic in `func_15` is as follows:
1. It initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
2. It iterates while `i * i` is less than or equal to `n + i`.
3. In each iteration, it increments `ans` by `(n + i) // (i * i)`.
4. After the loop, it returns `ans - 1`.

The loop condition and the calculation inside the loop do not seem to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The condition `i * i <= n + i` and the calculation `(n + i) // (i * i)` do not directly relate to the problem's requirement that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

The function `func_16` is responsible for reading the number of test cases and calling `func_15` for each test case, which is correct. However, since `func_15` does not correctly implement the solution, the overall program is incorrect.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect based on the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
