### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the program correctly solves the given problem.

#### Problem Recap
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Code Analysis

The code contains multiple utility functions for input and output, but the core function responsible for solving the problem is `func_15`. This function calculates the number of valid pairs for a given \(n\) and \(m\).

The logic in `func_15` is as follows:
1. Initialize `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
2. Iterate while `i * i` is less than or equal to `n + i`.
3. In each iteration, increment `ans` by `(n + i) // (i * i)`.
4. After the loop, return `ans - 1`.

The annotations and the original assessment suggest that the loop condition and the calculation inside the loop do not directly relate to the problem's requirement that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's verify the logic in `func_15` by comparing it to the problem requirements.

#### Verification

The key condition in the problem is:
\[ a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} \]

This implies:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \(k\).

Given the constraints, the provided logic in `func_15` does not seem to directly address this condition. Instead, it uses a loop that iterates based on a different condition (`i * i <= n + i`) and performs a calculation that does not directly relate to the problem's requirement.

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation

Based on the analysis, the given program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
