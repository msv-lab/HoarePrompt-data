Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    #The program returns `tmp + 1` where `tmp` is the minimum value returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for all `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` processes a dictionary `d` with integer keys and lists of integers as values, a list of integers `processing`, an integer `da`, and a list of integers `rank`. It returns 1 if the list associated with the key `da` in `d` contains only one element. Otherwise, it recursively processes each element in `d[da]` that has not been processed (indicated by `processing[di - 1]` being 0), updating the `processing` list and the `rank` list, and returns the minimum value obtained from these recursive calls plus one. The `rank` list is updated with the result for the key `da`.

    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, and two positive integers `n` and `m`. It also takes an integer `k`. It reduces `k` by the sum of `(m - a[i])` for each element `a[i]` in the list `a` that is less than `m`. If the resulting `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.

        i += 1
        
    #State: ans = 15, i = 4.
    return ans - 1

    #State: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6. The loop prints the number 1, m times, each on a new line.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` prints the number 1, `m` times, each on a new line. It does not return any value.
