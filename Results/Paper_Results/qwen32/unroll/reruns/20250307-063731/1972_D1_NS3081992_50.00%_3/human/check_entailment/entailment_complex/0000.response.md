### Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \text{gcd}(a, b)\).

Let's analyze the provided functions to see if they collectively solve the problem:

1. **Input Reading Functions:**
   - `func_1` to `func_11` are utility functions to read input. They do not contribute to the logic of solving the problem.

2. **Irrelevant Functions:**
   - `func_12` to `func_14` are not related to the problem. They appear to be solving a different problem involving graphs or some other data structures, which is not relevant here.

3. **Potential Solution Function:**
   - `func_15` is supposed to compute something based on \(n\) and \(m\). However, it does not use \(m\) at all and always returns 14, regardless of the input values of \(n\) and \(m\). This is clearly incorrect as it does not calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

4. **Main Function:**
   - `func_16` is the main function that calls `func_15` for each test case and prints the result. Since `func_15` always returns 14, `func_16` will print 14 for each test case, which is incorrect based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:

The provided program is incorrect because the function `func_15` does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as per the problem description. Instead, it always returns 14, which is not the correct solution for the given problem.

**Correctness: False**
