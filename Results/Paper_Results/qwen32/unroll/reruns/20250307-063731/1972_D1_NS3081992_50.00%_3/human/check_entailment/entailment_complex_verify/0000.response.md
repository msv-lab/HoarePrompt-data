### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code in detail to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
For each test case, given two integers `n` and `m`, find the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code contains multiple utility functions for reading input, but the core logic for solving the problem is in `func_15()` and the main function `func_16()` which calls `func_15()` for each test case.

Here is the relevant part of `func_15()`:
```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

Let's break down the logic inside `func_15()`:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs while `i * i <= n + i`. This condition does not directly relate to the problem's requirements.
2. **Accumulation Logic**: Inside the loop, `ans` is incremented by `(n + i) // (i * i)`. This logic does not correctly check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
3. **Return Value**: The function returns `ans - 1`, which is not aligned with the problem's requirement to count valid pairs.

The logic in `func_15()` does not correctly implement the required conditions. Here's a more detailed explanation:

- **Condition Check**: The core condition is that \(a + b\) should be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This means \((a + b) \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) = 0\).
- **Loop and Calculation**: The loop and calculation in `func_15()` do not check this condition. Instead, it performs a different calculation that does not guarantee the correct count of valid pairs.

#### Example Verification:
Let's consider the first test case from the problem statement:
- Input: `n = 1`, `m = 1`
- Expected Output: `1` (only the pair (1, 1) satisfies the condition)

Let's walk through the execution of `func_15()` for this input:
- `n = 1`, `m = 1`
- `i = 1`
- `ans = 0`
- `i * i = 1` and `n + i = 2`, so `1 * 1 <= 1 + 1` is true.
- `ans += (1 + 1) // (1 * 1) = 2 // 1 = 2`
- `i = 2`
- `i * i = 4` and `n + i = 3`, so `4 <= 3` is false, loop terminates.
- `return ans - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`

Although the output for this specific test case happens to be correct, the logic inside `func_15()` is not correct for other test cases. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.

Final: **False**
