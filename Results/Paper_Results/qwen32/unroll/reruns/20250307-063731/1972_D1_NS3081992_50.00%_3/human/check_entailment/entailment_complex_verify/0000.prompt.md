You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The core logic for calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions is missing or incorrect. The function `func_15()` seems to be an attempt at solving the problem, but its logic is not aligned with the problem statement.

Let's break down the problem requirements and the provided code:

### Problem Requirements:
1. For each test case, given two integers `n` and `m`, find the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that:
   - \(1 \le a \le n\)
   - \(1 \le b \le m\)
   - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Provided Code:
The code contains multiple functions, but the one that seems relevant to solving the problem is `func_15()`. However, the logic inside `func_15()` does not correctly implement the required conditions. Here is the relevant part of `func_15()`:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs while `i * i <= n + i`. This condition does not directly relate to the problem's requirements.
2. **Accumulation Logic**: Inside the loop, `ans` is incremented by `(n + i) // (i * i)`. This logic does not correctly check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
3. **Return Value**: The function returns `ans - 1`, which is not aligned with the problem's requirement to count valid pairs.

### Example:
Let's consider the first test case from the problem statement:
- Input: `n = 1`, `m = 1`
- Expected Output: `1` (only the pair (1, 1) satisfies the condition)

The provided code does not correctly handle this case or any other case as it does not properly implement the logic to check the conditions specified in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness is False.
