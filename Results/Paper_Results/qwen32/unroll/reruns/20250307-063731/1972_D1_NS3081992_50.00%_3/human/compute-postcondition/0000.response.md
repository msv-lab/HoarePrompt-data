In the provided task, the for loop will execute based on the return value of the function `func_10()`. The loop head only involves the underscore `_` and the function `func_10()`. Since the underscore `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the execution of the loop, the only thing we need to adjust is the return value of `func_10()` to ensure the loop executes.

To ensure the for loop executes at least once, the function `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0. The state of `n` and `m` are not directly related to the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0**
