Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the provided code and the annotations to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Code Analysis:
The core of the program is in `func_15`, which is called for each test case. Let's analyze `func_15` in detail.

#### Function `func_15`:
```python
def func_15():
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

##### Annotations:
- The loop condition is `i * i <= n + i`.
- In each iteration, `ans` is incremented by `(n + i) // (i * i)`.
- The function returns `ans - 1`.

##### Verification:
The annotations correctly describe the behavior of `func_15`, but we need to verify if this logic correctly solves the problem.

### Mathematical Verification:
To verify if the code correctly implements the solution, we need to check if the logic `(n + i) // (i * i)` and the loop condition `i * i <= n + i` correctly count the number of valid pairs (a, b).

The condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` can be rewritten as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \(k\).

This can be simplified to:
\[ a = (k - 1) \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]

Given this, the logic in `func_15` seems to be an attempt to count valid pairs, but the provided loop and calculation do not directly map to the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The problem requires counting pairs (a, b) based on the condition involving the gcd, which is not directly addressed by the logic in `func_15`. The provided code does not seem to correctly implement the required logic.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the analysis and verification, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Final: **False**
