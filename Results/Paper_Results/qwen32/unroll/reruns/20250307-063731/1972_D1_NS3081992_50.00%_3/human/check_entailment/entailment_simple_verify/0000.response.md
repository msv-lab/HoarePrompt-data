### Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. Let's systematically analyze the code and the annotations to confirm this:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - For each test case, given two integers `n` and `m`, find the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Provided Code Analysis**:
   - The code contains multiple utility functions (`func_1` to `func_11`) for reading input, which do not directly relate to the core logic of solving the problem.
   - The function `func_15()` is the one that seems to be attempting to solve the problem, but its logic is not aligned with the problem statement.

3. **Function `func_15()` Analysis**:
   - The relevant part of `func_15()` is:
     ```python
     def func_15():
         (n, m) = func_7()
         i = 1
         ans = 0
         while i * i <= n + i:
             ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
             i += 1
         return ans - 1
     ```
   - **Loop Condition**: The loop runs while `i * i <= n + i`. This condition does not directly relate to the problem's requirements.
   - **Accumulation Logic**: Inside the loop, `ans` is incremented by `(n + i) // (i * i)`. This logic does not correctly check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - **Return Value**: The function returns `ans - 1`, which is not aligned with the problem's requirement to count valid pairs.

4. **Example Validation**:
   - Consider the first test case from the problem statement:
     - Input: `n = 1`, `m = 1`
     - Expected Output: `1` (only the pair (1, 1) satisfies the condition)
   - The provided code does not correctly handle this case or any other case as it does not properly implement the logic to check the conditions specified in the problem.

5. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations provide insights into the state of the program at various points, but they do not indicate any logic that checks the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The annotations for `func_15()` confirm that the function is not implementing the required logic.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and the annotations, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
