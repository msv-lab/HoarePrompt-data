The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, and a list `m` of `n` integers. The integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` are within specific ranges, and the list `m` contains `n` distinct integers in strictly increasing order. The function processes these inputs for each test case and returns an output based on the given constraints.
