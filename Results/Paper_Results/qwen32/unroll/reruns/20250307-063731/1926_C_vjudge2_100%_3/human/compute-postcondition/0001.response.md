To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition `num != 0`. Given the state right before the loop, `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{num} \leq 2 \times 10^5\), and `a` is 0. Since `num` is already within the range \(1 \leq \text{num} \leq 2 \times 10^5\), it implies that `num` is not equal to 0. Therefore, the loop can certainly execute one time with the current state of `num`.

Since no adjustment is needed for `num` and `a` does not affect the loop condition, we simply repeat the program state right before the loop.

State: **`num` is an integer such that 1 ≤ num ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is 0**
