### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem by precomputing the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all integers from 1 to 200,000 and storing these cumulative sums in an array `A`. For each test case, it simply looks up the precomputed cumulative sum corresponding to the given `n`.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the program:

1. **Precomputation**:
    - The program iterates over each integer from 1 to 200,000.
    - For each integer `i`, it computes the sum of its digits using the `func_1` function.
    - It adds this digit sum to a running total `sum` and appends the current value of `sum` to the list `A`.
    - After this loop, `A[i-1]` contains the sum of the digit sums of all integers from 1 to `i`.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
    - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
    - It prints `A[n-1]`, which is the precomputed sum of the digit sums for all integers from 1 to `n`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
    - This function takes an integer `num` and returns the sum of its digits.
    - It repeatedly extracts the last digit of `num` using `num % 10`, adds it to `a`, and then removes the last digit from `num` using integer division `num // 10`.
    - This process continues until `num` becomes 0.

### Correctness:

The program correctly precomputes the cumulative sum of the digit sums and uses these precomputed values to answer each test case efficiently. The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a given number.

### Conclusion:

Given that the program correctly precomputes the required values and efficiently answers each test case, it is correct.

**Correctness: True**
