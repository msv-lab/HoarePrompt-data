### Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem by precomputing the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and then using this precomputed data to answer each test case in constant time.

1. **Precomputation Phase**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `sum` to 0.
   - It then iterates over all numbers from 1 to 200,000.
   - For each number `i`, it calculates the sum of its digits using the function `func_1`.
   - It adds this digit sum to the cumulative sum `sum` and appends `sum` to the list `A`.
   - After this loop, `A[i-1]` contains the sum of the digit sums of all numbers from 1 to `i`.

2. **Query Phase**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and outputs `A[n-1]`, which is the sum of the digit sums of all numbers from 1 to `n`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes an integer `num` and calculates the sum of its digits.
   - It does this by repeatedly taking the last digit of `num` (using `num % 10`), adding it to `a`, and then removing the last digit from `num` (using integer division `num = int(num / 10)`).
   - The function returns the sum `a` of the digits of `num`.

### Correctness:

- The logic of the program is correct. It precomputes the required cumulative sums and uses them efficiently to answer each test case.
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number.
- The precomputation phase ensures that each test case can be answered in constant time, which is necessary given the constraints (up to 10,000 test cases).

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Answer:
Correctness: **True**
