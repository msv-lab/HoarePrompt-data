### Reasoning:
The provided Python program aims to solve the problem by precomputing the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all integers from 1 to 200,000 and storing these cumulative sums in a list `A`. For each test case, it then retrieves the precomputed cumulative sum corresponding to the given `n` and prints it.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:
1. **Precomputation:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `sum` to 0.
   - It then iterates through numbers from 1 to 200,000 (inclusive).
   - For each number `i`, it calculates the sum of its digits using the `func_1` function and adds this to the cumulative `sum`.
   - The cumulative `sum` is then appended to the list `A`.
   
2. **Processing Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and prints the cumulative sum of digit sums up to `n` by accessing `A[n - 1]`.

3. **Digit Sum Calculation:**
   - The `func_1` function correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number by repeatedly taking the remainder when divided by 10 (to get the last digit), adding it to a running total, and then removing the last digit by integer division by 10.

### Issues:
- **Precomputation Range:** The program precomputes the cumulative sums for numbers up to 200,000, which is the maximum `n` that can be given in the problem. This is appropriate.
- **Output for Test Cases:** The program correctly retrieves the precomputed cumulative sum for each test case by accessing `A[n - 1]`, which is the correct index since list indices in Python are zero-based.
- **Variable Naming:** The use of `sum` as a variable name is not ideal because it shadows the built-in `sum()` function in Python. However, this does not affect the correctness of the program in this context.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It precomputes the necessary values and efficiently handles the test cases.

**Correctness: True**
