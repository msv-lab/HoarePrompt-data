The provided loop takes an integer `num` and an initial variable `a` set to 0. The loop continues to execute as long as `num` is not equal to 0. In each iteration, the loop adds the last digit of `num` (obtained by `num % 10`) to `a`, and then removes the last digit from `num` by performing integer division by 10 (`num = int(num / 10)`).

After the loop finishes executing, `num` will be 0, and `a` will be the sum of all the digits of the original `num`.

Output State: **`num` is 0 and `a` is the sum of the digits of the original `num`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop, `num` becomes 0, and `a` holds the sum of all the digits of the initial value of `num`.
