You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program:
A = []
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 200001):
    a = func_1(i)
    sum = sum + a
    A.append(sum)
for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    print(A[n - 1])

def func_1(num):
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        num = int(num / 10)
    return a



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` within the range 1 to 200,000 and returns the sum of its digits.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `sum` to 0.
   - The list `A` is intended to store cumulative sums of the digit sums from 1 to 200,000.

2. **Precomputation**:
   - For each number `i` from 1 to 200,000, the program computes the sum of its digits using the function `func_1(i)`.
   - This digit sum is then added to the cumulative `sum`.
   - The cumulative `sum` is appended to the list `A` for each `i`.

3. **Function `func_1(num)`**:
   - This function calculates the sum of the digits of a given number `num`.
   - It repeatedly extracts the last digit of `num` using `num % 10`, adds it to `a`, and then removes the last digit from `num` by performing integer division by 10 (`int(num / 10)`).
   - The function returns the sum of the digits.

4. **Handling Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints the value at index `n-1` of the precomputed list `A`.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Precomputation**:
  - The program precomputes the cumulative sum of digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000.
  - This means that for any `n` up to 200,000, the program can quickly retrieve the sum of the digit sums from 1 to `n` by accessing `A[n-1]`.

- **Efficiency**:
  - Precomputing the sums up to 200,000 ensures that each test case can be handled in constant time.
  - Given the constraints (up to 10,000 test cases and `n` up to 200,000), this approach is efficient and within the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case.

- **Output**:
  - For each test case, the program correctly outputs the sum of the digit sums from 1 to `n` by accessing the precomputed list `A`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the required functionality and handles the constraints efficiently. Therefore, it is correct.

Correctness: **True**
