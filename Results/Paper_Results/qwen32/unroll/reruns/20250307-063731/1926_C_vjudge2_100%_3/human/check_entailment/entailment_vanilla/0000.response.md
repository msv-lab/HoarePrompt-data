Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `sum` to 0.
   - The list `A` is intended to store cumulative sums of the digit sums from 1 to 200,000.

2. **Precomputation**:
   - For each number `i` from 1 to 200,000, the program computes the sum of its digits using the function `func_1(i)`.
   - This digit sum is then added to the cumulative `sum`.
   - The cumulative `sum` is appended to the list `A` for each `i`.

3. **Function `func_1(num)`**:
   - This function calculates the sum of the digits of a given number `num`.
   - It repeatedly extracts the last digit of `num` using `num % 10`, adds it to `a`, and then removes the last digit from `num` by performing integer division by 10 (`int(num / 10)`).
   - The function returns the sum of the digits.

4. **Handling Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints the value at index `n-1` of the precomputed list `A`.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Precomputation**:
  - The program precomputes the cumulative sum of digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000.
  - This means that for any `n` up to 200,000, the program can quickly retrieve the sum of the digit sums from 1 to `n` by accessing `A[n-1]`.

- **Efficiency**:
  - Precomputing the sums up to 200,000 ensures that each test case can be handled in constant time.
  - Given the constraints (up to 10,000 test cases and `n` up to 200,000), this approach is efficient and within the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case.

- **Output**:
  - For each test case, the program correctly outputs the sum of the digit sums from 1 to `n` by accessing the precomputed list `A`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the required functionality and handles the constraints efficiently. Therefore, it is correct.

Correctness: **True**
