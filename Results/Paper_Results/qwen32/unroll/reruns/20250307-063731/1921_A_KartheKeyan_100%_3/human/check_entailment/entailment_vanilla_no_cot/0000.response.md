Correctness: **False**

The provided program calculates the area of the square incorrectly. The program calculates the product of the distances of two adjacent sides (which are the same for a square) but it does not square the distance to get the area. Instead, it multiplies the two distances and takes the square root of the result, which is not the correct approach.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        
        # Sort coordinates to make it easier to find the side length
        coord = sorted(coord)
        
        # Calculate the distance between two adjacent points
        side_length = math.sqrt((coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2)
        
        # The area of the square is the side length squared
        area = side_length ** 2
        print(int(area))
        n -= 1

func()
```

In this corrected version, the side length is calculated correctly and then squared to get the area of the square. The `int(area)` ensures that the area is printed as an integer, which matches the problem's output requirement.
