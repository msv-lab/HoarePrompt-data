`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `t`, `l`, and `s` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an input integer; `l` is the last input length processed; `s` is the value calculated from the last `l` using the formula `(l // 4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2`.**
