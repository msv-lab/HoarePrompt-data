### Reasoning:

The program is designed to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and whether it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads four lines of input, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of a corner of the square.

2. **Sorting Coordinates:**
   - The program sorts the coordinates. This sorting is crucial because it helps in easily identifying the adjacent corners of the square. After sorting, the coordinates can be assumed to be in a specific order, which simplifies the calculation of side lengths.

3. **Calculating Side Lengths:**
   - The program calculates the squared distance between two adjacent corners (`p1`) and another pair of adjacent corners (`p2`). It assumes that after sorting, the first two coordinates and the last two coordinates are adjacent pairs.
   - The squared distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is calculated using the formula: \((x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2\).

4. **Calculating Area:**
   - The program calculates the side length by taking the square root of the squared distance (`p1` and `p2` should be equal for a square).
   - It then calculates the area by multiplying the side length by itself.
   - The result is rounded and printed.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Assumption about Sorted Coordinates:**
  - The sorting of coordinates does not guarantee that the first two and the last two coordinates will be adjacent corners. For example, if the coordinates are \((1, 1)\), \((4, 1)\), \((1, 4)\), and \((4, 4)\), sorting them will result in \((1, 1)\), \((1, 4)\), \((4, 1)\), \((4, 4)\). Here, the first two and the last two coordinates are not adjacent.
- **Incorrect Calculation of Area:**
  - The program calculates the area by multiplying the square roots of `p1` and `p2`. This is incorrect because `p1` and `p2` should be the same for a square, and the area should be calculated as the square of the side length.

### Correct Approach:
- After sorting the coordinates, the program should calculate the squared distance between the first and second coordinates (`p1`), and the squared distance between the first and third coordinates (`p2`). One of these will be the squared side length, and the other will be the squared diagonal length.
- The side length can be determined by taking the square root of the smaller of `p1` and `p2`.
- The area is then calculated as the square of the side length.

### Conclusion:
The program contains logical errors in how it determines the side lengths and calculates the area. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
