### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the provided program using the problem description, the code, and the function summary to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
The problem involves sorting a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on any substring, with the goal of minimizing the total cost. The cost of each cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the binary string `s` and processes it using `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Converts the string `sChar` into a list `s`.
   - Initializes `left` pointer to 0, `cost` to 0, and `right` pointer to 1.
   - The algorithm aims to swap '1's and '0's to sort the string, but the implementation seems flawed.

3. **Algorithm Logic**:
   - The algorithm uses two pointers, `left` and `right`, to find pairs of '1' and '0' to swap.
   - When a '0' is found at `right` and a '1' is found at `left`, it swaps them and adds the cost `right - left + 1`.
   - It increments `right` until it finds a '0' and increments `left` until it finds a '1'.
   - This process continues until `left` is greater than `right` or either pointer reaches the end of the string.

#### Issues with the Algorithm:
1. **Suboptimal Swapping**:
   - The algorithm only performs swaps when it finds a '1' followed by a '0', but it does not consider the optimal sequence of swaps to minimize the total cost.
   - The algorithm does not handle cases where multiple swaps are needed to sort the string optimally.

2. **Incorrect Condition**:
   - The condition `left <= right` is incorrect because `left` should never be greater than `right` in a valid swap scenario.
   - The algorithm does not handle cases where multiple swaps are needed to sort the string optimally.

3. **Handling of Multiple Swaps**:
   - The algorithm does not account for the fact that multiple swaps might be needed to sort the string optimally. It only performs a single swap each time it finds a '1' followed by a '0'.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the test case `101011`:
- The algorithm will swap the first '1' with the first '0', resulting in `011011` with a cost of 2.
- It will then swap the next '1' with the next '0', resulting in `001111` with a cost of 3.
- The total cost is 5, but the optimal solution involves fewer swaps with a total cost of 5 (as per the example).

#### Correctness:
The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string. The algorithm logic is flawed and does not guarantee the minimum cost. It only performs simple swaps without considering the optimal sequence of swaps.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
