The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over `sChar`. To ensure the loop can execute, `sChar` must contain at least one binary string. The variable `s` is initialized as an empty list and is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`sChar` is a list of binary strings that must have at least 1 binary string, `s` is an empty list**
