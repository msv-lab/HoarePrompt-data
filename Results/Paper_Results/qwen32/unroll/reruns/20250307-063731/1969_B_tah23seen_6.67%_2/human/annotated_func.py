#State of the program right berfore the function call: sChar is a list of binary strings, where each string s satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5 and consists only of the characters '0' and '1'. The total length of all strings in sChar does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
        
    #State: s is a list that contains all the binary strings from sChar in the same order.
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            s[right], s[left] = s[left], s[right]
            cost += right - left + 1
        
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
        
    #State: s = ['0', '0', '1', '1', '1'], left = 2, right = 5, cost = 5.
    return cost
    #The program returns cost which is 5.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of binary strings `sChar` and returns the cost calculated based on specific swaps needed to arrange the characters in a certain pattern. The cost is determined by the number of swaps required to move '0's to the left of '1's in the list, with each swap contributing to the cost based on the positions involved.
