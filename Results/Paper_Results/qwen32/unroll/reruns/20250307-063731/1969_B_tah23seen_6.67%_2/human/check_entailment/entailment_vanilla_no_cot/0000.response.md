Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the allowed cyclic shift operations. Specifically, the program's logic for swapping '0's and '1's and calculating the cost does not account for the optimal strategy to achieve the sorted order.

The algorithm should consider the positions of '0's and '1's and perform operations to move all '0's to the left and all '1's to the right in the most cost-effective manner. The given code does not handle this correctly and may not produce the minimum cost for all test cases.

A correct approach would involve identifying segments of '1's and '0's, and calculating the cost to move '0's to the left of '1's in a way that minimizes the total cost.
