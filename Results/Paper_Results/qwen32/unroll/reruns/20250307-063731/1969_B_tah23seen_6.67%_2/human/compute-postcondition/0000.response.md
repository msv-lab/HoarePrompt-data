The code snippet provided initializes an empty list `s`. This operation does not affect the existing variable `sChar` in any way. Therefore, the initial state of `sChar` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`sChar` is a list of binary strings, where each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5 and consists only of the characters '0' and '1'. The total length of all strings in `sChar` does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `s` is an empty list.**
