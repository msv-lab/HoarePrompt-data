Let's carefully analyze the provided program and function summary against the problem description and the given assessment.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
- The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `r-l+1` is `r-l+1`.
- We need to determine the minimum total cost to sort the string.

### Program Analysis:
The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string. However, the function does not simulate cyclic shifts. Instead, it attempts to swap characters directly when it finds a '1' followed by a '0'. This is not the intended operation according to the problem description.

### Function Summary:
The summary states that `func_1` attempts to move '0's to the left of '1's by swapping them and calculates the cost based on the positions involved. However, this does not align with the problem's requirement to perform cyclic shifts.

### Original Assessment:
The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not correctly simulate cyclic shifts and instead performs incorrect swaps. Let's verify this with a counterexample.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input `1010`:
- The expected output is `2` because we can perform a single cyclic shift on the entire string `[1, 4]` (i.e., `1010` becomes `0101` and then another shift `[1, 4]` becomes `0011` and finally `[1, 4]` becomes `0001`, but the minimum cost is achieved by shifting `1010` to `0101` in one operation costing 2).
- The program will likely output a different value because it does not correctly simulate the cyclic shift operation.

### Detailed Analysis:
Let's walk through the execution of `func_1` with the input `1010`:
1. Initialize `left` to 0 and `right` to 1.
2. At `left = 0` and `right = 1`, `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', so swap them. The string becomes `0110` and the cost is `1 - 0 + 1 = 2`.
3. Increment `right` until it points to the next '0', which is at index 3.
4. Increment `left` until it points to the next '1', which is at index 1.
5. At `left = 1` and `right = 3`, `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', so swap them. The string becomes `0011` and the cost is `3 - 1 + 1 = 3`.
6. The total cost is `2 + 3 = 5`.

The program's output for `1010` is `5`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `2`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. Instead, it performs incorrect swaps.

Final: **False**
