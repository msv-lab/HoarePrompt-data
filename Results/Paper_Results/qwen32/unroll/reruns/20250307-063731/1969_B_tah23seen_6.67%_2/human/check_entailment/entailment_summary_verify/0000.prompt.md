You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            (s[right], s[left]) = (s[left], s[right])
            cost += right - left + 1
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
    return cost



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of binary strings `sChar` and returns the cost calculated based on specific swaps needed to arrange the characters in a certain pattern. The cost is determined by the number of swaps required to move '0's to the left of '1's in the list, with each swap contributing to the cost based on the positions involved.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Let's analyze the logic and find a counterexample where the program fails.

The main issue with the code is that it attempts to swap '1's and '0's whenever it encounters a '1' followed by a '0', but it does not correctly account for the cost or the need to perform multiple cyclic shifts to achieve the sorted order. The code does not simulate the cyclic shift operation and instead tries to swap characters directly, which is not the intended operation.

Let's consider a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
1010
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- One optimal strategy is to perform a cyclic shift on the substring `[1, 2]` (i.e., `10` becomes `01`), which costs `2`.
- The string is now `0110`.
- Perform another cyclic shift on the substring `[2, 4]` (i.e., `110` becomes `011`), which costs `3`.
- However, the minimum cost to sort the string `1010` is `2` by performing a single cyclic shift on the entire string `[1, 4]` (i.e., `1010` becomes `0101` and then another shift `[1, 4]` becomes `0011` and finally `[1, 4]` becomes `0001`).

**Actual Output of the Program:**
The program will likely output a different value, as it does not correctly simulate the cyclic shift operation and instead performs incorrect swaps.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is therefore incorrect.
