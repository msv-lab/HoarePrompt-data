You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            (s[right], s[left]) = (s[left], s[right])
            cost += right - left + 1
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
    return cost



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of binary strings `sChar` and returns the cost calculated based on specific swaps needed to arrange the characters in a certain pattern. The cost is determined by the number of swaps required to move '0's to the left of '1's in the list, with each swap contributing to the cost based on the positions involved.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires finding the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order (all 0s followed by all 1s) by performing cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the binary string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Converts the string `sChar` into a list `s`.
   - Initializes `left` pointer to 0, `cost` to 0, and `right` pointer to 1.
   - The algorithm aims to swap '1's and '0's to sort the string, but the implementation seems flawed.

3. **Algorithm Logic**:
   - The algorithm uses two pointers, `left` and `right`, to find pairs of '1' and '0' to swap.
   - When a '0' is found at `right` and a '1' is found at `left`, it swaps them and adds the cost `right - left + 1`.
   - It increments `right` until it finds a '0' and increments `left` until it finds a '1'.
   - This process continues until `left` is greater than `right` or either pointer reaches the end of the string.

### Correctness Issues:
- The algorithm does not guarantee the minimum cost to sort the string. It only performs swaps when it finds a '1' followed by a '0', but it does not consider the optimal sequence of swaps to minimize the total cost.
- The condition `left <= right` is incorrect because `left` should never be greater than `right` in a valid swap scenario.
- The algorithm does not handle cases where multiple swaps are needed to sort the string optimally.

### Example:
Consider the test case `101011`:
- The algorithm will swap the first '1' with the first '0', resulting in `011011` with a cost of 2.
- It will then swap the next '1' with the next '0', resulting in `001111` with a cost of 3.
- The total cost is 5, but the optimal solution involves fewer swaps with a total cost of 5 (as per the example).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string. Therefore, it is incorrect.
