The function `func_1` accepts a list of binary strings `sChar` and returns the cost calculated based on specific swaps needed to arrange the characters in a certain pattern. The cost is determined by the number of swaps required to move '0's to the left of '1's in the list, with each swap contributing to the cost based on the positions involved.
