### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python program and compare it with the problem requirements.

The problem requires us to cyclically shift substrings of a binary string to sort it in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's should come before all '1's). The cost of each operation is the length of the substring shifted.

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the string and swapping '0's and '1's whenever a '1' is found to the left of a '0'. The cost is calculated as the difference between their positions plus one. However, this approach does not correctly simulate the cyclic shift operation and does not ensure the minimum cost to sort the string.

Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Cyclic Shift vs. Swapping**: The problem specifies a cyclic shift, which involves moving a substring to the right and placing its last element at the beginning. The provided program instead performs simple swaps between '0' and '1', which is not equivalent to a cyclic shift.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation in the provided program is based on the positions of the elements being swapped, not the length of the substring being cyclically shifted. This is incorrect according to the problem statement.

3. **Minimum Cost**: The program does not guarantee finding the minimum cost to sort the string. It simply swaps '0's and '1's whenever possible, which may not be the most efficient way to sort the string with cyclic shifts.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if the string is already sorted, the cost should be 0, but the program may still perform unnecessary operations.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **False**
