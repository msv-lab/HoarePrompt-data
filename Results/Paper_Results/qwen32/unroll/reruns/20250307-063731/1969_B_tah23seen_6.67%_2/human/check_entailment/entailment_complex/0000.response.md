Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings. However, the logic within `func_1` is flawed and does not correctly compute the minimum cost required to sort the string.

Here are some issues with the provided code:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Cyclic Shifts**: The code swaps characters directly when it encounters a '0' on the right and a '1' on the left, which does not accurately represent a cyclic shift. A cyclic shift involves moving a substring, not just swapping two characters.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation is incorrect because it simply adds the length of the substring that would be shifted if the characters were swapped, but it doesn't account for the actual minimal cost of achieving the sorted order through cyclic shifts.

3. **Loop Conditions and Logic**: The loop conditions and the logic to update `left` and `right` pointers are not correctly implemented to handle all edge cases and to ensure that the string is fully sorted with minimal cost.

4. **Example Test Cases**: The example provided in the problem statement and the expected output do not match the behavior of the provided code. For instance, in the third test case (`11000`), the expected cost is 9, but the code does not compute this correctly.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
