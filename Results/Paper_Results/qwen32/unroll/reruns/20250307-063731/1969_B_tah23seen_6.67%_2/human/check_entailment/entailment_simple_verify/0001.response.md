### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated version to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective**: Sort a binary string in non-descending order (all 0s followed by all 1s) using cyclic shifts on any substring.
- **Cost**: The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted.
- **Goal**: Find the minimum total cost to achieve the sorted order.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the binary string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Converts the string `sChar` into a list `s`.
   - Initializes `left` pointer to 0, `cost` to 0, and `right` pointer to 1.
   - The algorithm aims to swap '1's and '0's to sort the string.

3. **Algorithm Logic**:
   - The algorithm uses two pointers, `left` and `right`, to find pairs of '1' and '0' to swap.
   - When a '0' is found at `right` and a '1' is found at `left`, it swaps them and adds the cost `right - left + 1`.
   - It increments `right` until it finds a '0' and increments `left` until it finds a '1'.
   - This process continues until `left` is greater than `right` or either pointer reaches the end of the string.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Condition**: The condition `left <= right` is incorrect. The `left` pointer should never be greater than the `right` pointer in a valid swap scenario.
2. **Non-Optimal Swapping**: The algorithm does not guarantee the minimum cost. It only performs swaps when it finds a '1' followed by a '0', but it does not consider the optimal sequence of swaps to minimize the total cost.
3. **Handling of Multiple Swaps**: The algorithm does not handle cases where multiple swaps are needed to sort the string optimally.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the test case `101011`:
- The algorithm will swap the first '1' with the first '0', resulting in `011011` with a cost of 2.
- It will then swap the next '1' with the next '0', resulting in `001111` with a cost of 3.
- The total cost is 5, but the optimal solution involves fewer swaps with a total cost of 5 (as per the example).

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotated code shows the state of the program before and after the function call.
- The final state of `s` in the annotated example is `['0', '0', '1', '1', '1']` with `left = 2`, `right = 5`, and `cost = 5`.
- This state does not reflect an optimal solution for the given test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string. The algorithm's logic and conditions are flawed, and it does not guarantee an optimal solution.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
