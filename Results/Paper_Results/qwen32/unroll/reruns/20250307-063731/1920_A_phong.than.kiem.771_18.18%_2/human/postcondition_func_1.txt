The function reads a line of input and returns a list of items derived from that line. If `space` is True, the line is split into substrings based on spaces; if `space` is False, the line is split into individual characters. If `to_int` is True, each item in the list is converted to an integer. If `to_int` is False, the items are returned as strings.
