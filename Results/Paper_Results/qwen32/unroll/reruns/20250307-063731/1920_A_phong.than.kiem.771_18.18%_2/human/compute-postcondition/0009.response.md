Postcondition: **`start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t == 1`, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t == 2`, and `num` is a list of all `v` values when `t == 3`. `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]`. The current value of `start` is greater than `end`.**
