Output State: **The program returns the value of `end - start + 1 - count_num` if `end - start + 1` is greater than or equal to `count_num`, otherwise it returns 0.**

In simpler terms, the program calculates the difference between the maximum value (`end`) and the minimum value (`start`) of `v` for `t == 2` and `t == 1` respectively, adds 1 to it, and then subtracts the count of `v` values within that range from `num` (where `t == 3`). If this result is non-negative, it returns that value; otherwise, it returns 0.
