### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program `func_7()` based on the problem description and the function summary provided.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the number of integers `k` that satisfy a set of constraints.
- Constraints can be of three types:
  1. `k >= x`
  2. `k <= x`
  3. `k != x`
- The program should handle multiple test cases and return the number of valid integers `k` for each test case.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function reads constraints and determines the range `[start, end]` based on constraints of type 1 and 2.
- It collects values from constraints of type 3 into a list `num`.
- It counts how many values in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]`.
- It returns the number of valid integers `k` as `end - start + 1 - count_num` if the range is valid and `count_num` does not exceed the range size. Otherwise, it returns 0.

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `start` is initialized to `-1`. This is not a problem since `start` will be updated with the first constraint of type 1.
   - `end` is initialized to `1000000000.0`, which is effectively `10^9`. This is correct as it is the maximum possible value for `k`.

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, the program updates `start` and `end` appropriately based on the type of constraint.
   - It correctly collects values from constraints of type 3 into the list `num`.

3. **Counting Invalid Values:**
   - The program counts how many values in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]`. This is done correctly.

4. **Calculating Valid Values:**
   - The program checks if `start > end` to determine if there are no valid `k` values.
   - It calculates the number of valid `k` values as `end - start + 1 - count_num`.
   - It ensures that the number of valid values is not negative by returning 0 if it is.

5. **Verification Against Example Cases:**
   - The original assessment verified the program against the provided example cases and found that the outputs were correct.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the constraints and produces the expected results for all example cases. The function summary and the detailed analysis confirm that the logic is sound and the implementation is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
