### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is not used in the given code snippet. It seems to serve a different purpose, possibly for other parts of the program that are not shown here. For the current program, it is irrelevant.

2. **Function `func_2`**: Similarly, this function is not used in the given code snippet. It is designed to read input lines and convert them to lists of integers or characters, based on the parameters `space` and `to_int`. Again, it is irrelevant for the current program.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function is not used in the given code snippet. It concatenates a list of integers into a single string with a given symbol separating the integers. It is irrelevant for the current program.

4. **Function `func_4`**: This function is not used in the given code snippet. It finds all occurrences of a substring within a string and returns their starting indices. It is irrelevant for the current program.

5. **Function `func_5`**: This function is not used in the given code snippet. It returns all indices of a given element in a list. It is irrelevant for the current program.

6. **Function `func_6`**: This function is not used in the given code snippet. It searches for a sublist in a list of lists where a specific index matches a given value. It is irrelevant for the current program.

7. **Function `func_7`**: This function is used in the given code snippet. It reads the constraints for each test case, determines the valid range for `k` based on the constraints of type 1 and type 2, and then counts how many values in the constraints of type 3 fall within this range. It returns the total number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints.

### Analysis of `func_7`:

- **Initialization**: The function initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to 1,000,000,000.0. It also initializes an empty list `num` to store values for constraints of type 3.
- **Reading Constraints**: It reads `n` constraints, updating `start` for type 1 constraints, `end` for type 2 constraints, and appending values to `num` for type 3 constraints.
- **Counting Invalid `k` Values**: It counts how many values in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]`.
- **Calculating Valid `k` Values**: If `start > end`, it means the range is invalid, and it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid `k` values by subtracting `count_num` from the size of the range `[start, end]`. If this number is negative, it returns 0.

### Verification:

The function `func_7` correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. It handles all three types of constraints and correctly calculates the valid range and excludes values that are not allowed.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct as per the problem description and the provided execution states.

**Correctness: True**
