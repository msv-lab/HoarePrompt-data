### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided functions to determine if the program is correct.

**Problem Breakdown:**
- We need to find the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy all given constraints.
- Constraints are of three types:
  1. \( k \geq x \)
  2. \( k \leq x \)
  3. \( k \neq x \)
- We need to handle multiple test cases, each with a set of constraints.

**Functions Analysis:**

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - Reads the number of test cases.
   - This function is correctly used to determine the number of test cases.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - Reads a line of input and returns a list of integers.
   - This function is versatile but not used in the provided code.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - Joins a list of integers into a string with a specified separator.
   - This function is not used in the provided code.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - Finds all starting indices of a substring within a string.
   - This function is not used in the provided code.

5. **Function 5 (`func_5`)**:
   - Finds all indices of a specific element within a list.
   - This function is not used in the provided code.

6. **Function 6 (`func_6`)**:
   - Searches for a sublist in a list of lists where a specific element matches a given value at a given index.
   - This function is not used in the provided code.

7. **Function 7 (`func_7`)**:
   - Reads constraints for a single test case.
   - Tracks the maximum value for constraints of type 1 and the minimum value for constraints of type 2.
   - Collects values for constraints of type 3.
   - Counts how many values from type 3 constraints fall within the range determined by type 1 and type 2 constraints.
   - Returns the count of valid integers \( k \) that satisfy all constraints.

**Correctness of `func_7`:**
- `func_7` correctly handles the logic for finding the range of valid \( k \) values by keeping track of the maximum and minimum bounds.
- It correctly counts the number of values from type 3 constraints that fall within the valid range.
- It ensures that the range is valid (i.e., `start <= end`) and returns the correct count of valid integers \( k \).

**Conclusion:**
Since `func_7` correctly handles the logic for each test case and the other functions are either not used or are auxiliary functions that are not necessary for solving the problem, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
