The provided Python code snippet initializes a variable `count_num` to 0. This action does not affect the values of `start`, `end`, or `num` as they are not referenced or modified in the given code. 

Therefore, the Output State remains the same for `start`, `end`, and `num`, with only `count_num` being initialized.

Output State: **`start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t == 1`, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t == 2`, and `num` is a list of all `v` values when `t == 3`; `count_num` is 0.**
