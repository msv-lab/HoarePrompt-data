The function accepts a list of lists (`arr`), a non-negative integer (`index`), and a value (`value`). It searches through each sublist in `arr` to find a sublist where the element at the position specified by `index` matches the given `value`. If such a sublist is found, it returns that sublist. If no matching sublist is found after checking all sublists, the function returns `None`.
