To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand how the values of `start`, `end`, and `num` are modified during each iteration based on the input values of `t` and `v`.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `start` is initialized to -1.
   - `end` is initialized to 1000000000.0.
   - `num` is initialized to an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each iteration (from 0 to `n-1`), the loop reads a tuple `(t, v)` where `t` can be 1, 2, or 3, and `v` is an integer.
   - If `t == 1`, `start` is updated to `v` if `v` is greater than the current `start`.
   - If `t == 2`, `end` is updated to `v` if `v` is less than the current `end`.
   - If `t == 3`, `v` is appended to the list `num`.

3. **Final State:**
   - After all iterations, `start` will be the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t == 1`.
   - `end` will be the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t == 2`.
   - `num` will be a list of all `v` values encountered when `t == 3`.

Given the above logic, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t == 1`, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t == 2`, and `num` is a list of all `v` values when `t == 3`.**
