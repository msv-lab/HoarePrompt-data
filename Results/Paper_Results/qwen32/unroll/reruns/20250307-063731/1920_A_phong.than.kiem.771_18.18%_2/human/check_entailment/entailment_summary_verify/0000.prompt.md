You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 7 : The function reads a series of integer pairs, where each pair consists of a type `t` and a value `v`. It determines the maximum value `start` from pairs where `t` is 1, the minimum value `end` from pairs where `t` is 2, and collects all values `v` from pairs where `t` is 3 into a list `num`. It then counts how many values in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]`. Finally, it returns 0 if the range `[start, end]` is invalid (i.e., `start > end`) or if the number of values in `num` within the range exceeds the size of the range. Otherwise, it returns the difference between the size of the range and the count of values within the range.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error that can lead to incorrect results in certain cases. Specifically, the program does not handle the constraints correctly, especially when the range defined by constraints of type 1 and 2 does not overlap with the numbers that need to be excluded by constraints of type 3.

### Problematic Case:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3
1 5
2 5
3 5
```

### Expected Output:
The only possible value for `k` is 5, but `k` cannot be 5 due to the constraint `k != 5`. Therefore, the expected output should be `0`.

### Actual Output:
The program will output `1` because it counts 5 as a valid number even though it is excluded by the constraint `k != 5`.

### Reason:
The program calculates the range of valid `k` values by finding the maximum value from constraints of type 1 and the minimum value from constraints of type 2. It then counts the numbers in this range that are not excluded by constraints of type 3. However, if the range is exactly the number that needs to be excluded, the program incorrectly counts it as valid.

### Correct Approach:
The program should correctly handle the case where the range defined by constraints of type 1 and 2 is exactly the number that needs to be excluded by constraints of type 3. The current logic does not account for this scenario properly.

### Corrected Logic:
The logic should ensure that if the range defined by constraints of type 1 and 2 is a single number and that number is excluded by a constraint of type 3, the result should be `0`.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not handle this specific edge case correctly, the correctness of the program is **False**.
