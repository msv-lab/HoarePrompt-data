Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is -1, `end` is a float initialized to 1000000000.0, `num` is a list that will store integers, `t` is an integer in {1, 2, 3}, and `v` is an integer such that 1 <= v <= 10^9.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `start` has been explicitly set to -1. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
