Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints, followed by n lines each containing two integers a (a ∈ {1, 2, 3}) and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). The integer a denotes the type of constraint: if a=1, k must be greater than or equal to x; if a=2, k must be less than or equal to x; if a=3, k must not be equal to x. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same (all pairs (a, x) are distinct).
