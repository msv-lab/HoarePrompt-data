To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we'll analyze the loop based on the provided initial state and the loop's logic.

### Initial State Recap:
- `start`: The maximum value of `v` when `t == 1`.
- `end`: The minimum value of `v` when `t == 2`.
- `num`: A list of all `v` values when `t == 3`.
- `count_num`: Initially set to 0.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `num`. For each element, it checks if `i` is outside the range `[start, end]` (i.e., `i < start` or `i > end`). If `i` is outside this range, the loop skips to the next iteration using `continue`. If `i` is within the range, `count_num` is incremented by 1.

### Output State Calculation:
- `start`, `end`, and `num` remain unchanged as the loop does not modify these variables.
- `count_num` will be the count of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t == 1`, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t == 2`, and `num` is a list of all `v` values when `t == 3`; `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]`.**
