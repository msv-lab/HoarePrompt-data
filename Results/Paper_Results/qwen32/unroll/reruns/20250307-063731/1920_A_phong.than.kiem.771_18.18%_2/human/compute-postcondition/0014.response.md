Functionality: **The function reads a series of integer pairs, where each pair consists of a type `t` and a value `v`. It determines the maximum value `start` from pairs where `t` is 1, the minimum value `end` from pairs where `t` is 2, and collects all values `v` from pairs where `t` is 3 into a list `num`. It then counts how many values in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]`. Finally, it returns 0 if the range `[start, end]` is invalid (i.e., `start > end`) or if the number of values in `num` within the range exceeds the size of the range. Otherwise, it returns the difference between the size of the range and the count of values within the range.**
