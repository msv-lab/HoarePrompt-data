The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the iterable `num`. For the loop to execute, `num` must contain at least one element since `i` will take on the values of the elements in `num` one by one. The state of `start`, `end`, and `count_num` do not affect the execution of the loop directly, so they do not need to be adjusted in relation to the loop's execution.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t == 1`, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t == 2`, `num` is a list of all `v` values when `t == 3` and must have at least 1 element, `count_num` is 0**
