    #The program returns `ans`, which is the result of cumulative multiplication and modulo operations based on the values of `N`, `L`, `R`, `M1`, `M2`, and the conditions specified. If `M1` is 1, `ans` is `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. Otherwise, `ans` is computed through a series of operations involving `cur`, `nums_left`, and the elements of `L` and `R`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input values defining test cases, each with integers `N`, `M1`, `M2`, and two lists `L` and `R`. It checks specific conditions involving the elements of `L` and `R` and the values of `M1` and `M2`. If any of the conditions are not met, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates and returns a value `ans` which is either a binomial coefficient or the result of a series of cumulative multiplication and modulo operations.
