Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers such that 1 <= `M1`, `M2` <= `N` <= 2 * 10^5; `p_1`, `p_2`, ..., `p_{M1}` are integers such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `N` and `p_1` < `p_2` < ... < `p_{M1}`; `s_1`, `s_2`, ..., `s_{M2}` are integers such that 1 <= `s_i` <= `N` and `s_1` < `s_2` < ... < `s_{M2}`; The sum of all `N` across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `N`, `M1`, and `M2`. The values of `t`, the sequences `p_1` to `p_{M1}`, and `s_1` to `s_{M2}`, as well as the constraints on these variables, remain unchanged.
