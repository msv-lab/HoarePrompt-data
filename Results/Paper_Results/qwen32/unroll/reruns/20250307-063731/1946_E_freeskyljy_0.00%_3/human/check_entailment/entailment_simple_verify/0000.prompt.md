You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Some permutation of length n is guessed.

You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each
integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.

Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at
that element. More formally, the element a_i is a prefix maximum if a_i > a_j
for every j < i .

Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element a_i is a suffix maximum if
a_i > a_j for every j > i .

You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been
guessed.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m_1 and m_2 (1 \le
m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation, the number
of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < \ldots <
p_{m_1} (1 \le p_i \le n ) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing
order.

The third line of each test case contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < \ldots <
s_{m_2} (1 \le s_i \le n ) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing
order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the number of
suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not handle all edge cases and potential scenarios as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Prefix and Suffix Maximums**: The code checks if the last prefix maximum (`L[-1]`) is equal to the first suffix maximum (`R[0]`). This is correct, but it does not ensure that all prefix and suffix maximums are correctly positioned and valid.

2. **Boundary Conditions**: The code checks if the first prefix maximum (`L[0]`) is 1 and the first suffix maximum (`R[0]`) is `N`. This is correct as the permutation must start with the smallest element and end with the largest element.

3. **Handling Overlapping Prefix and Suffix Maximums**: The code checks if the second last prefix maximum (`L[-2]`) is equal to the second suffix maximum (`R[1]`) when both `M1` and `M2` are greater than 1. This is an incorrect assumption. The second last prefix maximum does not necessarily have to be the same as the second suffix maximum.

4. **Combinatorial Calculation**: The code calculates the number of permutations using combinations, but it does not correctly account for all possible placements of the remaining elements between the prefix and suffix maximums. The combinatorial logic needs to be more robust to handle all cases.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
5 3 3
1 3 5
1 3 5
```
The correct output should be `1` because the only permutation that satisfies the conditions is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. However, the code might not handle this correctly due to the incorrect assumptions about the positions of prefix and suffix maximums.

### Conclusion:
Given the above issues and the provided counterexample, the code is not correct for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is `False`.
