To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic and ensure it correctly handles all the constraints and edge cases specified in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Checks:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `N`, `M1`, and `M2`, followed by the lists `L` and `R`.
   - It immediately checks if the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. If not, it returns 0 because the permutation cannot have both a prefix maximum at index `L[-1]` and a suffix maximum at a different index `R[0]`.
   - It also checks if the first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is `N`. If not, it returns 0 because the permutation must have a prefix maximum at the first element and a suffix maximum at the last element.
   - It then checks if there are more than one prefix and suffix maximums and if the second-to-last prefix maximum is equal to the second suffix maximum. If so, it returns 0 because this configuration is invalid.

2. **Calculating the Number of Permutations:**
   - The program calculates the initial number of permutations using `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. This is the number of ways to choose `L[-1] - 1` elements out of `N - 1` to be placed before the maximum element at `L[-1]`.
   - It then iterates over the prefix maximums from the second-to-last to the second, adjusting the number of permutations based on the remaining positions and the constraints.
   - Similarly, it iterates over the suffix maximums from the second to the second-to-last, adjusting the number of permutations in the same manner.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles cases where there are no prefix or suffix maximums beyond the first and last elements.
   - It correctly calculates the number of permutations modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the constraints and edge cases specified in the problem statement. It checks for invalid configurations and calculates the number of valid permutations using combinatorial mathematics. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
