To ensure that the `while` loop can execute at least once, the condition `i > 1` must be true. Given the state right before the loop, `i` is currently `N - 1`. For the loop to execute, `i` should be greater than 1. Since `N` is an integer such that `1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5`, `N - 1` will be at least 0 when `N` is 1. However, when `N` is 2, `N - 1` equals 1, which does not satisfy the condition `i > 1`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes at least once, `N` must be at least 3, making `i` (which is `N - 1`) at least 2, thus satisfying `i > 1`.

No other variables in the loop condition need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 2 * 10^5; `M1`, and `M2` are integers such that 1 <= `M1`, `M2` <= `N`; `M1` is greater than 1; `p_1`, `p_2`, ..., `p_{M1}` are integers such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `N` and `p_1` < `p_2` < ... < `p_{M1}`; `s_1`, `s_2`, ..., `s_{M2}` are integers such that 1 <= `s_i` <= `N` and `s_1` < `s_2` < ... < `s_{M2}`; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `R` is a list of integers read from the input; the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`; `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is `N`; At least one of the following is true: `M2` is 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`; `ans` is `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`; `cur` is `M1 - 2`; `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`; `i` is `N - 1`**
