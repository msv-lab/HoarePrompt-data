Functionality: **The function reads input values defining test cases, each with integers `N`, `M1`, `M2`, and two lists `L` and `R`. It checks specific conditions involving the elements of `L` and `R` and the values of `M1` and `M2`. If any of the conditions are not met, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates and returns a value `ans` which is either a binomial coefficient or the result of a series of cumulative multiplication and modulo operations.**
