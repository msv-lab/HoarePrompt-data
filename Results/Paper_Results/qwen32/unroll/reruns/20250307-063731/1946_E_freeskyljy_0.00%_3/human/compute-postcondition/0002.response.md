The code snippet provided reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `R`. The other variables (`t`, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `p_1`, ..., `p_{M1}`, `s_1`, ..., `s_{M2}`, and `L`) are not modified by this code snippet.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers such that 1 <= `M1`, `M2` <= `N` <= 2 * 10^5; `p_1`, `p_2`, ..., `p_{M1}` are integers such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `N` and `p_1` < `p_2` < ... < `p_{M1}`; `s_1`, `s_2`, ..., `s_{M2}` are integers such that 1 <= `s_i` <= `N` and `s_1` < `s_2` < ... < `s_{M2}`; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `R` is a list of integers read from the input.**
