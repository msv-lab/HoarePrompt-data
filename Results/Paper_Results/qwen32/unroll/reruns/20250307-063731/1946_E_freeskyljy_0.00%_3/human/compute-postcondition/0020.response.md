The code snippet updates the value of `nums_left` by setting it to `N - R[0] - 1`. Given the initial state, `R[0]` is `N`, so `nums_left` will be `N - N - 1`, which simplifies to `-1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers such that 1 <= `M1`, `M2` <= `N` <= 2 * 10^5; `p_1`, `p_2`, ..., `p_{M1}` are integers such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `N` and `p_1` < `p_2` < ... < `p_{M1}`; `s_1`, `s_2`, ..., `s_{M2}` are integers such that 1 <= `s_i` <= `N` and `s_1` < `s_2` < ... < `s_{M2}`; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `R` is a list of integers read from the input; the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`; `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is `N`; At least one of the following is true: `M1` is 1, `M2` is 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`. If `M1` > 1, then `i` is 1, `cur` is a value between -1 and `M1 - 2`, `nums_left` is -1, and `ans` is the result of the cumulative multiplication and modulo operations. If `M1` is 1, `cur` remains `M1 - 2` and `ans` is `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. `nums_left` is -1.**
