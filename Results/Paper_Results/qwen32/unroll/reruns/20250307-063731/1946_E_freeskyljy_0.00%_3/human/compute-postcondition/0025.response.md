To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop given the initial conditions and the loop's logic.

### Initial Conditions Recap:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers with constraints on their values.
- `p_1`, `p_2`, ..., `p_{M1}` and `s_1`, `s_2`, ..., `s_{M2}` are sorted lists of integers within the range [1, N].
- `L` and `R` are lists of integers with specific constraints on their first and last elements.
- `M1` and `M2` have specific constraints, and at least one of the given conditions is true.
- Depending on the value of `M1`, `cur` and `ans` are initialized differently.
- `nums_left` is initialized to -1.
- The loop iterates while `i < N`.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = N-1`. The loop has two main branches:
1. If `i == R[cur]`, it increments `cur` by 1.
2. Otherwise, it multiplies `ans` by `nums_left` and takes modulo `MOD`, then decrements `nums_left`.

### Key Points:
- `nums_left` starts at -1 and is decremented in each iteration.
- `cur` is incremented only when `i` matches the current element in `R`.
- The loop runs `N` times, from `i = 0` to `i = N-1`.

### Final State Calculation:
- Since `nums_left` starts at -1 and is decremented `N` times, it will end up at `-1 - N`.
- `cur` will be incremented each time `i` matches an element in `R`. Since `R[0]` is `N` and the loop stops at `i = N-1`, `cur` will not be incremented during the loop.
- `ans` will be multiplied by `nums_left` in each iteration where `i != R[cur]`. Given the constraints and the initialization of `ans`, the final value of `ans` will depend on the initial value and the cumulative effect of the multiplications and modulo operations.

### Output State:
Given the initial conditions and the loop's behavior, the final output state is:

Output State: **`cur` is 0, `nums_left` is -1 - N, and `ans` is the result of the cumulative multiplication and modulo operations.**

In natural language, after the loop finishes executing, `cur` remains 0 because `i` never matches an element in `R` during the loop iterations. `nums_left` is decremented `N` times, resulting in `-1 - N`. `ans` is the result of multiplying it by `nums_left` in each iteration where `i` does not match `R[cur]`, and taking modulo `MOD` each time.
