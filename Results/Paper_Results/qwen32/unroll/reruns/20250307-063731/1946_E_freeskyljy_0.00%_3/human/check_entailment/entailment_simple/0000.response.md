### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the number of permutations that can satisfy the given prefix and suffix maximum conditions. Let's analyze the logic and correctness of the program step-by-step:

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - The program first checks if the last element of the prefix maximum indices list `L` is equal to the first element of the suffix maximum indices list `R`. This is necessary because the last prefix maximum must also be the first suffix maximum.
   - It then checks if the first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is `N`. This is because the smallest number (1) must be the first prefix maximum, and the largest number (`N`) must be the first suffix maximum.
   - It also checks if `M1 > 1`, `M2 > 1`, and `L[-2] == R[1]`. This check ensures that the second last prefix maximum is not the second suffix maximum, as this would violate the constraints of the problem.

2. **Combinatorial Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of ways to arrange the numbers between the first prefix maximum (which is 1) and the last prefix maximum (which is also the first suffix maximum) using `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.
   - It then iterates backward from `L[-1] - 1` to 2, multiplying the number of remaining positions by the number of ways to place numbers that are not prefix maxima.
   - Similarly, it iterates forward from `R[0] + 1` to `N`, multiplying the number of remaining positions by the number of ways to place numbers that are not suffix maxima.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - All calculations are done modulo `10^9 + 7` to ensure the results fit within standard integer limits and to meet the problem's requirements.

### Issues and Corrections:
- **State Analysis**:
  - The state analysis provided in the comments seems to have some inaccuracies. For example, the comment stating `nums_left` is `L[-1] - N + 1` or `nums_left` is `-1 - N` is incorrect. `nums_left` should represent the number of remaining positions to place numbers, which should be adjusted correctly in each iteration.
- **Logic Flaws**:
  - The condition `if (M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and L[-2] == R[1])` is not sufficient to cover all invalid cases. There could be other configurations that also lead to invalid permutations.
  - The iteration logic might not correctly account for all valid placements of numbers between prefix and suffix maxima.

### Conclusion:
Given the detailed analysis, the program has several logical issues and inaccuracies in its state transitions and calculations. Therefore, we cannot confirm its correctness based on the provided logic and analysis.

**Correctness: False**
