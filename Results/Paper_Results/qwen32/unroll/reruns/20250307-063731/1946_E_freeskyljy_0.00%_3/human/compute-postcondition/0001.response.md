The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and maps them into a list `L`. This means that `L` will now hold the integers from the input line.

Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `p_1`, `p_2`, ..., `p_{M1}`, `s_1`, `s_2`, ..., `s_{M2}` remain unchanged. The new variable `L` is introduced and is assigned the list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers such that 1 <= `M1`, `M2` <= `N` <= 2 * 10^5; `p_1`, `p_2`, ..., `p_{M1}` are integers such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `N` and `p_1` < `p_2` < ... < `p_{M1}`; `s_1`, `s_2`, ..., `s_{M2}` are integers such that 1 <= `s_i` <= `N` and `s_1` < `s_2` < ... < `s_{M2}`; `L` is a list of integers read from the input.**
