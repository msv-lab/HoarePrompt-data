Let's analyze the given loop and determine the final state of the variables after the loop completes.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers such that \(1 \leq M1, M2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `M1` is greater than 1.
- `p_1`, `p_2`, ..., `p_{M1}` are integers such that \(1 \leq p_i \leq N\) and `p_1` < `p_2` < ... < `p_{M1}`.
- `s_1`, `s_2`, ..., `s_{M2}` are integers such that \(1 \leq s_i \leq N\) and `s_1` < `s_2` < ... < `s_{M2}`.
- `L` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `R` is a list of integers read from the input.
- The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`.
- `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is `N`.
- At least one of the following is true: `M2` is 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`.
- `ans` is `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.
- `cur` is `M1 - 2`.
- `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`.
- `i` is `N - 1`.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop runs while `i > 1`. In each iteration:
- If `i` equals `L[cur]`, `cur` is decremented by 1.
- Otherwise, `ans` is updated as `ans * nums_left % MOD`.
- `nums_left` is decremented by 1.
- `i` is decremented by 1.

### Key Observations:
1. **Loop Condition (`i > 1`)**: The loop will run from `i = N - 1` down to `i = 2`.
2. **`cur` Management**: `cur` starts at `M1 - 2` and decrements whenever `i` matches an element in `L` (except the last element).
3. **`ans` Calculation**: `ans` is multiplied by `nums_left` and then taken modulo `MOD` whenever `i` does not match an element in `L`.
4. **`nums_left` Management**: `nums_left` starts at `L[-1] - 2` and decrements in every iteration.
5. **`i` Management**: `i` decrements in every iteration.

### Final State:
- **`i`**: By the end of the loop, `i` will be 1.
- **`cur`**: `cur` will be -1 if all elements in `L` (except the last) are encountered in the loop. Otherwise, it will be a value between -1 and `M1 - 2`.
- **`nums_left`**: `nums_left` will be `L[-1] - (N - 1)`, which simplifies to `L[-1] - N + 1`.
- **`ans`**: The final value of `ans` will be the result of the cumulative multiplication and modulo operations described above.

### Output State:
Output State: **`i` is 1, `cur` is a value between -1 and `M1 - 2`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - N + 1`, `ans` is the result of the cumulative multiplication and modulo operations.**

### Natural Language Description:
After the loop completes, the variable `i` will be 1, indicating the loop has run until its termination condition. The variable `cur` will have decremented as many times as there were matches between `i` and elements in `L` (excluding the last element). The variable `nums_left` will reflect the number of elements left to consider after the loop iterations. The variable `ans` will hold the final result of the cumulative multiplication and modulo operations performed during the loop.
