Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2`, and two lists `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}` and `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}`. For each test case, the function performs specific calculations involving cumulative multiplication and modulo operations based on the values of `n`, `m_1`, `m_2`, the lists `p` and `s`, and certain conditions. If `m_1` is 1, it returns the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n - 1, p_{m_1} - 1)`. Otherwise, it computes a result `ans` through a series of operations. In all cases, the function returns 0 except for the specific computation described when `m_1` is not 1.**
