Reasoning:

The provided program addresses the problem by checking several conditions that ensure the validity of the prefix and suffix maximum indices and then calculates the number of permutations that could have resulted in those indices. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - The program first checks if the last element of `L` (prefix maximum indices) is equal to the first element of `R` (suffix maximum indices). This is necessary because the last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum must be the same element, which is the overall maximum of the permutation.
   - It then checks if the first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is `N`. This is because the first prefix maximum must be the first element of the permutation, and the first suffix maximum must be the last element of the permutation.
   - If `M1 > 1` and `M2 > 1`, it checks if the second last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`. This is an additional constraint to ensure that the second last prefix maximum and the second suffix maximum do not overlap inappropriately.

2. **Computation of `ans`**:
   - If the initial checks pass, the program calculates the number of valid permutations using combinatorial mathematics.
   - It starts by calculating the binomial coefficient `C(N-1, L[-1]-1)` which represents the number of ways to choose the positions for the prefix maximums and suffix maximums.
   - It then iterates through the prefix maximum indices from the second last to the second, adjusting the number of possible permutations by multiplying the remaining positions.
   - Similarly, it iterates through the suffix maximum indices from the second to the second last, adjusting the number of possible permutations in the same manner.
   - All calculations are done modulo `10^9 + 7` to handle large numbers.

The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement, and the logic aligns with the combinatorial approach required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
