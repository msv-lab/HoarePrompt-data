The code snippet assigns a new value to `nums_left` based on the value of `L[-1]`. Given the initial state, `L[-1]` is the last element of the list `L`, and it is specified that `L[0]` is 1 and the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. Therefore, `nums_left` is calculated as `L[-1] - 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers such that 1 <= `M1`, `M2` <= `N` <= 2 * 10^5; `M1` is greater than 1; `p_1`, `p_2`, ..., `p_{M1}` are integers such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `N` and `p_1` < `p_2` < ... < `p_{M1}`; `s_1`, `s_2`, ..., `s_{M2}` are integers such that 1 <= `s_i` <= `N` and `s_1` < `s_2` < ... < `s_{M2}`; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `R` is a list of integers read from the input; the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`; `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is `N`; At least one of the following is true: `M2` is 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`; `ans` is `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`; `cur` is `M1 - 2`; `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`.**
