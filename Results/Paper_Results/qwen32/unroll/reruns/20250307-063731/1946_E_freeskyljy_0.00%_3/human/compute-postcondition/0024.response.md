The `while` loop in the provided code snippet is:

```python
while i < N:
    # the loop body is omit
```

To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, the condition `i < N` must be `True`. Therefore, we need to make sure that the value of `i` is less than `N`.

From the provided state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers such that 1 <= `M1`, `M2` <= `N` <= 2 * 10^5.
- `p_1`, `p_2`, ..., `p_{M1}` are integers such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `N` and `p_1` < `p_2` < ... < `p_{M1}`.
- `s_1`, `s_2`, ..., `s_{M2}` are integers such that 1 <= `s_i` <= `N` and `s_1` < `s_2` < ... < `s_{M2}`.
- `L` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `R` is a list of integers read from the input.
- The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`.
- `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is `N`.
- At least one of the following is true: `M1` is 1, `M2` is 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`.
- If `M1` > 1, then `i` is `N + 1`, `cur` is 1, `nums_left` is -1, and `ans` is the result of the cumulative multiplication and modulo operations.
- If `M1` is 1, `cur` is 0 and `ans` is `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. `nums_left` is -1.
- Additionally, `M2` is greater than 1.

The only variable in the loop head is `i`. To ensure the loop executes, `i` must be less than `N`. 

Given that if `M1` > 1, `i` is initially set to `N + 1`, which would prevent the loop from executing, we need to adjust `i` to a value less than `N`. If `M1` is 1, `i` is not mentioned, so we can assume it needs to be set to a value less than `N` as well.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is less than `N`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers such that 1 <= `M1`, `M2` <= `N` <= 2 * 10^5; `p_1`, `p_2`, ..., `p_{M1}` are integers such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `N` and `p_1` < `p_2` < ... < `p_{M1}`; `s_1`, `s_2`, ..., `s_{M2}` are integers such that 1 <= `s_i` <= `N` and `s_1` < `s_2` < ... < `s_{M2}`; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `R` is a list of integers read from the input; the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`; `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is `N`; At least one of the following is true: `M1` is 1, `M2` is 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`; If `M1` > 1, then `i` is less than `N`, `cur` is 1, `nums_left` is -1, and `ans` is the result of the cumulative multiplication and modulo operations. If `M1` is 1, `cur` is 0 and `ans` is `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. `nums_left` is -1. Additionally, `M2` is greater than 1.**
