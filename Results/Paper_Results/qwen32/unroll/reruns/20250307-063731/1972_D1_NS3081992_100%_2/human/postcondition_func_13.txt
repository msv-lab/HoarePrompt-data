The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a` and three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. It calculates a modified value of `k` by subtracting the difference between `m` and each element in `a` that is less than `m`. If the modified `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.
