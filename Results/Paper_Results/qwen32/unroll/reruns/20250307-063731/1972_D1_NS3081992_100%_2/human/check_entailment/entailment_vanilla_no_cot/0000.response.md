Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The function `func_15` is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs (a, b) for given n and m, but the logic inside `func_15` does not correctly implement the conditions specified in the problem statement.

The problem requires pairs (a, b) such that `1 <= a <= n`, `1 <= b <= m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The provided function `func_15` does not check these conditions in a way that ensures the solution is correct for all possible inputs.

To solve the problem correctly, one would need to iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) and check if they satisfy the given conditions. However, due to the constraints (`1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6`), a more efficient approach is needed, possibly using mathematical insights to reduce the number of checks.

The current implementation in `func_15` seems to be attempting a solution based on a different problem or an incorrect understanding of the current problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem.
