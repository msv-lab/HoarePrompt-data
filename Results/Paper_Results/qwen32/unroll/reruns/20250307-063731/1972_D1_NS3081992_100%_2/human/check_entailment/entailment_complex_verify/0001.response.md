### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and analyze the provided solution to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Simplification:
1. Let \(g = \gcd(a, b)\).
2. Then \(a = g \cdot x\) and \(b = g \cdot y\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
3. The condition becomes: \(g \cdot x + g \cdot y\) is a multiple of \(g \cdot y \cdot g\), which simplifies to \(x + y\) is a multiple of \(g \cdot y\).
4. Further simplification gives: \(x + y\) is a multiple of \(y\), which means \(x\) must be a multiple of \(y\).

Thus, for each \(b\) in the range \([1, m]\), we need to count the number of \(a\) in the range \([1, n]\) such that \(a\) is a multiple of \(b\).

#### Implementation Analysis:
The provided code includes several utility functions but the core logic for solving the problem is in `func_15`. Let's analyze `func_15`:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

This implementation does not correctly count the number of valid pairs. The logic in `func_15` seems to be incorrect for the given problem. It does not properly iterate over all possible values of \(b\) and count the multiples of \(b\) up to \(n\).

#### Correct Implementation:
A correct implementation would involve iterating over all possible values of \(b\) and counting the multiples of \(b\) up to \(n\). Here is a corrected version of the `func_15` function:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    ans = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        ans += (n // b)
    return ans
```

This corrected implementation correctly counts the number of valid pairs by iterating over each possible value of \(b\) and summing the number of multiples of \(b\) up to \(n\).

#### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaw in the implementation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
