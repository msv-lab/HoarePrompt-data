Functionality: **The function `func_13` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers `a` and `b` and returns a tuple containing the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity and the GCD itself. Specifically, it returns `(x, y, g)` where `g` is the GCD of `a` and `b`, and `x` and `y` are integers satisfying the equation `ax + by = g`.**
