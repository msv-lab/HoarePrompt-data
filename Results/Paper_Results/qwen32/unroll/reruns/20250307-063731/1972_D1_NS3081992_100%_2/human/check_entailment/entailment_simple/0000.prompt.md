Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    #The program returns an integer that was read from the standard input.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_2()`. The function appears to be reading input from standard input and returning it as a map of integers, but since there are no parameters, no precondition can be derived from the signature alone.

    #The program returns a map object that contains integers, which are the result of splitting a line of input read from standard input and converting each split component into an integer.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature. The function `func_3` is designed to read a line of input from standard input, split it into a list of integers, and return this list. It does not take any parameters and is assumed to be used within a context where `sys.stdin.buffer.readline()` is valid and provides the necessary input.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not have any parameters in its signature, so there are no variables to describe. However, based on the context, it is expected to read input values from the standard input, which are two positive integers n and m. Therefore, the precondition can be inferred as: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_7():
