The function does not have any parameters in its signature, so there are no variables to describe. However, based on the context, it is expected to read input values from the standard input, which are two positive integers n and m. Therefore, the precondition can be inferred as: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
