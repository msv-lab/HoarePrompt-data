To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects present in the loop head, which in this case is the function call `func_10()` within the `range()` function. The loop will execute if `func_10()` returns a positive integer, as `range()` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 up to, but not including, the value returned by `func_10()`.

Given the state before the loop starts, `n` and `m` are positive integers within specific ranges, but these variables are not directly involved in the loop head. Therefore, we need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a positive integer.

Since we cannot modify the implementation of `func_10()`, we must assume it will return a value that determines whether the loop executes. If `func_10()` returns 0 or a negative number, the loop will not execute. To ensure the loop executes, we need to assume or adjust the state such that `func_10()` returns a positive integer.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `func_10()` must return a positive integer**

This state ensures that the loop will execute because the range function will generate a sequence of numbers, allowing the loop to iterate at least once.
