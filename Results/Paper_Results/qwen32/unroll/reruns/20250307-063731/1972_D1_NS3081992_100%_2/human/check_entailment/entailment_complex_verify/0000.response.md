To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to carefully analyze the logic of the function `func_15()` and see if it correctly counts the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the given conditions.

### Problem Recap:
The goal is to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Analysis of `func_15()`:
The function `func_15()` is provided as follows:

```python
def func_15():
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

#### Step-by-Step Evaluation:
1. **Input Reading**: The function reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) using `func_7()`.
2. **Initialization**: It initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
3. **Loop**: The loop runs while `i` is less than or equal to `m` and \(i^2\) is less than or equal to \(n + i\).
4. **Accumulation**: Inside the loop, it adds \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to `ans`.
5. **Return**: Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

#### Verification:
Let's verify if this logic correctly counts the pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions.

The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \(k\).

This can be simplified to:
\[ a = (k - 1) \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]

Since \(\gcd(a, b)\) divides both \(a\) and \(b\), let \(a = d \cdot x\) and \(b = d \cdot y\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). Then the condition becomes:
\[ d \cdot x + d \cdot y = k \cdot d \cdot y \]
\[ x + y = k \cdot y \]
\[ x = (k - 1) \cdot y \]

This means \(x\) must be a multiple of \(y\). Since \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), the only solution is \(x = y = 1\) or \(x = k - 1\) and \(y = 1\).

Thus, the only valid pairs are those where \(a\) is a multiple of \(b\).

#### Correctness of `func_15()`:
The loop in `func_15()` iterates over possible values of \(i\) and counts how many multiples of \(i\) fit within the range of \(a\). The logic seems to be counting the number of valid pairs by considering divisors and their multiples.

However, the logic in `func_15()` does not directly check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be counting pairs based on a different but related condition.

### Re-evaluation:
The provided program does not seem to correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. The logic in `func_15()` does not accurately account for all valid pairs \((a, b)\).

To illustrate why the code is incorrect, let's consider the test case \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):

- Valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).
- The expected output is 3.

However, the current implementation of `func_15()` would not produce the correct result for this test case or many others.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the analysis, the provided program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
