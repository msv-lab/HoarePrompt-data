Let's carefully analyze the problem and the given code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Code Analysis

The code consists of several utility functions (`func_1` to `func_10`) that read input and output results. The core functionality is implemented in `func_15()` and `func_16()`.

#### Function `func_15()`
This function is supposed to compute the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\). The logic used in `func_15()` is as follows:
```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```
This function iterates through possible values of \(i\) and computes \((n + i) // (i * i)\). The loop condition \(i \le m\) and \(i * i \le n + i\) suggests that it is trying to count pairs based on some mathematical insight. However, the logic seems to be incomplete or incorrect for the problem at hand.

#### Function `func_16()`
This function handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15()` for each test case, printing the result.
```python
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
```

### Function Summary Analysis

The function summary for `func_16()` states:
> Output hints for function number 16 : The function prints the value of `m` on a new line `n` times.

This summary is incorrect. `func_16()` does not print the value of `m` on a new line `n` times. Instead, it prints the result of `func_15()` for each test case.

### Verification Against Problem Description

The logic in `func_15()` does not appear to correctly implement the problem's requirements. The problem requires checking pairs \((a, b)\) to see if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The current logic in `func_15()` does not seem to perform this check.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. The logic in `func_15()` does not accurately count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions.

Final: **False**
