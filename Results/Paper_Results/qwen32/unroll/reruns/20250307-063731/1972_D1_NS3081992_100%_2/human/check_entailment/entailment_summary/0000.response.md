### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its functions to see if they meet the problem requirements.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_10()` reads a single integer from the input, which is the number of test cases.
   - `func_7()` reads two integers from the input, which are `n` and `m` for each test case.

2. **Core Logic:**
   - `func_15()` is the function that performs the main logic to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for given `n` and `m`.
   - Inside `func_15()`, it iterates through possible values of `i` from 1 to `m` and as long as `i * i` is less than or equal to `n + i`.
   - For each valid `i`, it calculates `(n + i) // (i * i)` and adds this to the accumulated sum `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Output:**
   - `func_16()` iterates over each test case, calls `func_15()` to compute the number of valid pairs, and writes the result to the standard output.

### Analysis of `func_15()`:

The logic in `func_15()` is not directly aligned with the problem statement. The problem requires counting pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 <= a <= n`, `1 <= b <= m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The provided function `func_15()` does not implement this logic.

The current implementation of `func_15()` seems to be counting something else, possibly related to divisors or some other unrelated problem.

### Correct Implementation:

To correctly solve the problem, `func_15()` should be modified to iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Here is a possible correct implementation:

```python
def func_13(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def func_15():
    n, m = func_7()
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * func_13(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count
```

### Conclusion:

Given the current implementation, `func_15()` does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
