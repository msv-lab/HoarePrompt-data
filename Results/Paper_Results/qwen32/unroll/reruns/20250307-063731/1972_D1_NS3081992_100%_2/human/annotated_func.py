#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer from the standard input and returns it.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_2()`. The function appears to be reading input from standard input and returning it as a map of integers, but since there are no parameters, no precondition can be derived from the signature alone.

    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains integers, which are the result of splitting a line of input read from standard input and converting each split component into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a line of input from standard input, splits it into components, converts each component into an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature. The function `func_3` is designed to read a line of input from standard input, split it into a list of integers, and return this list. It does not take any parameters and is assumed to be used within a context where `sys.stdin.buffer.readline()` is valid and provides the necessary input.
def func_3():

    #The program returns a list of integers read from standard input, where each integer is separated by whitespace in the input line.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a line of input from standard input, splits it into a list of integers based on whitespace, and returns this list of integers.

    #The program returns a string that is the line of input read from standard input, with any trailing newline characters removed and decoded to a regular string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` reads a line of input from standard input, removes any trailing newline characters, and returns the result as a regular string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not have any parameters in its signature, so there are no variables to describe. However, based on the context, it is expected to read input values from the standard input, which are two positive integers n and m. Therefore, the precondition can be inferred as: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.

    #The program returns a list of values produced by calling `func_7()` `rows` times, where `rows` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each call to `func_7()` will generate a value based on the logic defined within `func_7()`, and this value will be included in the resulting list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `rows` representing the number of test cases and returns a list of values. Each value in the list is generated by calling `func_7()` once for each test case.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters. It returns the value provided by the user input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature. This function likely reads input from the user and returns it as an integer, but it does not contribute directly to the precondition of the main problem-solving function.

    #The program returns a list of strings, which are the space-separated values from the line of input read by the function `func_11`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` reads a line of input from the user and returns a list of strings, where each string is a space-separated value from the input line.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where each key maps to a list of integers, processing is a list of integers, da is an integer, and rank is a list of integers.

    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if (len(d[da]) == 1) :

        #The program returns 1
    #State: d is a dictionary where each key maps to a list of integers, processing is a list of integers, da is an integer, and rank is a list of integers; tmp is 1000000000. The length of the list `d[da]` is not equal to 1.
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
        
    #State: - `d` remains unchanged.
    #   - `processing` remains unchanged in terms of its overall state because each element that is set to 1 is reset to 0 by the end of the loop.
    #   - `da` remains unchanged.
    #   - `rank` remains unchanged.
    #   - `tmp` will hold the minimum value returned by `func_12` for all elements `di` in `d[da]`.
    #
    #Thus, the output state after the loop has executed all iterations is:
    #
    #Output State:
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns `tmp + 1`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` processes a dictionary `d` where each key maps to a list of integers, a list `processing`, an integer `da`, and a list `rank`. It recursively explores the lists in `d` starting from the key `da`. If the list `d[da]` contains only one element, it returns 1. Otherwise, it modifies the `processing` list to mark elements as processed, recursively calls itself for each element in `d[da]`, and updates the `rank` list with the minimum value returned by the recursive calls plus one. Finally, it returns this minimum value plus one. The function ensures that the `processing` list is reset to its original state before returning.

    #The program returns `y`, `x - a // b * y`, and `g`. Here, `x`, `y`, and `g` are the values returned by `func_13(b, a % b)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers `a` and `b` and returns a tuple containing the coefficients of Bézout's identity and the GCD itself. Specifically, it returns `(x, y, g)` where `g` is the GCD of `a` and `b`, and `x` and `y` are integers satisfying the equation `ax + by = g`.

    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a` and three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. It calculates a modified value of `k` by subtracting the difference between `m` and each element in `a` that is less than `m`. If the modified `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.
