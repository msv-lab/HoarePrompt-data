You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` processes a dictionary `d` where each key maps to a list of integers, a list `processing`, an integer `da`, and a list `rank`. It recursively explores the lists in `d` starting from the key `da`. If the list `d[da]` contains only one element, it returns 1. Otherwise, it modifies the `processing` list to mark elements as processed, recursively calls itself for each element in `d[da]`, and updates the `rank` list with the minimum value returned by the recursive calls plus one. Finally, it returns this minimum value plus one. The function ensures that the `processing` list is reset to its original state before returning.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers `a` and `b` and returns a tuple containing the coefficients of Bézout's identity and the GCD itself. Specifically, it returns `(x, y, g)` where `g` is the GCD of `a` and `b`, and `x` and `y` are integers satisfying the equation `ax + by = g`.

    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a` and three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. It calculates a modified value of `k` by subtracting the difference between `m` and each element in `a` that is less than `m`. If the modified `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function prints the value of `m` on a new line `n` times.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program and determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:

The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
- 1 ≤ a ≤ n
- 1 ≤ b ≤ m
- a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

### Solution Approach:

The key to solving this problem efficiently lies in understanding the condition `a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)`. This can be simplified as follows:

1. Let `g = gcd(a, b)`.
2. Then `a = g * x` and `b = g * y` where `gcd(x, y) = 1`.
3. The condition becomes: `g * x + g * y` is a multiple of `g * y * g` which simplifies to `x + y` is a multiple of `g * y`.
4. Further simplification gives: `x + y` is a multiple of `y` which means `x` must be a multiple of `y`.

Thus, for each `b` in the range [1, m], we need to count the number of `a` in the range [1, n] such that `a` is a multiple of `b`.

### Implementation Analysis:

Let's look at the provided code:

- **Function 15 (`func_15`)**: This function appears to calculate the number of valid pairs for a given `n` and `m`.
- **Function 16 (`func_16`)**: This function processes multiple test cases by calling `func_15` for each test case.

The core logic for counting the number of valid pairs is in `func_15`:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

However, this implementation does not correctly count the number of valid pairs. The logic in `func_15` seems to be incorrect for the given problem. It does not properly iterate over all possible values of `b` and count the multiples of `b` up to `n`.

### Correct Implementation:

A correct implementation would involve iterating over all possible values of `b` and counting the multiples of `b` up to `n`. Here is a corrected version of the `func_15` function:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    ans = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        ans += (n // b)
    return ans
```

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
