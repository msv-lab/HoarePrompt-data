### Reasoning:

The given problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The provided code consists of several functions, but the relevant function for solving the problem is `func_15`. This function is called for each test case and calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the input values \(n\) and \(m\).

Here's a breakdown of the logic in `func_15`:

1. **Input Reading**: The function reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) using `func_7()`, which reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers.

2. **Initialization**: It initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0. `i` will be used to iterate over potential values, and `ans` will accumulate the count of valid pairs.

3. **Loop**: The loop runs while `i` is less than or equal to \(m\) and \(i \cdot i\) is less than or equal to \(n + i\). Inside the loop:
   - It calculates \((n + i) // (i \cdot i)\) and adds this to `ans`.
   - It increments `i` by 1.

4. **Result Calculation**: After the loop, it returns `ans - 1`.

The loop condition and the calculation inside the loop suggest that the function is attempting to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given constraints.

However, the logic in `func_15` does not directly match the problem's requirement. The problem requires checking whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for each pair \((a, b)\). The current implementation in `func_15` does not perform this check.

Given the problem's constraints and the need to verify each pair \((a, b)\) against the condition, the provided function `func_15` is not correct for solving the problem as described.
