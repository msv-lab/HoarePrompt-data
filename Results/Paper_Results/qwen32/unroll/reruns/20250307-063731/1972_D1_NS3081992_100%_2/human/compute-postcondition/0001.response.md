To determine the output state after the loop executes all its iterations, we need to understand what the functions `func_10()` and `func_15()` do. However, since the code does not provide the definitions of these functions, we will make some reasonable assumptions based on the typical usage of such functions in loops.

1. **Assumption for `func_10()`**: This function likely returns the number of iterations the loop should perform. Given the initial state mentions `n` and `m`, a reasonable assumption is that `func_10()` could return either `n` or `m`. For the sake of this explanation, let's assume `func_10()` returns `n`.

2. **Assumption for `func_15()`**: This function likely returns the value that should be printed in each iteration. Again, given the initial state mentions `n` and `m`, a reasonable assumption is that `func_15()` could return either `n`, `m`, or some derived value. For the sake of this explanation, let's assume `func_15()` returns `m`.

With these assumptions, the loop will iterate `n` times, and in each iteration, it will print `m` followed by a newline.

Therefore, the output state will be that the value `m` is printed `n` times, each on a new line. The variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6. The value of m is printed n times, each on a new line.**
