### Reasoning:

The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because `func_15()` does not correctly implement the solution for the problem described. The provided explanation includes a test case where the expected output is 3, but the current implementation of `func_15()` does not produce this result.

Let's analyze the logic in `func_15()` to determine if it correctly counts the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions specified in the problem.

### Problem Analysis:

The problem requires counting pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Implementation Analysis:

The function `func_15()` calculates the number of valid pairs as follows:
```python
def func_15():
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

Let's break down the logic:
- The loop runs while \(i \le m\) and \(i^2 \le n + i\).
- For each \(i\), it adds \((n + i) // (i^2)\) to `ans`.
- Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

This logic seems to be a mathematical approach to count the pairs, but it's not immediately clear if it correctly counts all valid pairs \((a, b)\).

### Verification with Test Case:

Let's verify the function with the test case \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):

- For \(i = 1\):
  - \(i \le m\) and \(i^2 \le n + i\) is true (\(1 \le 3\) and \(1 \le 3\)).
  - \((n + i) // (i^2) = (2 + 1) // 1 = 3\).
  - `ans` becomes 3.

- For \(i = 2\):
  - \(i \le m\) and \(i^2 \le n + i\) is true (\(2 \le 3\) and \(4 \le 4\)).
  - \((n + i) // (i^2) = (2 + 2) // 4 = 1\).
  - `ans` becomes 4.

- For \(i = 3\):
  - \(i \le m\) and \(i^2 \le n + i\) is false (\(3 \le 3\) but \(9 \not\le 5\)).

- The loop terminates, and `ans` is 4.
- The function returns `ans - 1`, which is 3.

The function correctly returns 3 for the test case \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), which matches the expected output.

### General Correctness:

While the function works for this test case, we need to ensure it works for all test cases. The mathematical approach used in `func_15()` is based on the observation that for a given \(i\), the number of valid \(a\) values can be counted using the formula \((n + i) // (i^2)\).

Given the constraints \(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\), the loop efficiently counts the pairs without iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\), which would be computationally infeasible.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem description. The function `func_15()` accurately counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the mathematical approach described.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
