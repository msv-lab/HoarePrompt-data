The function `drank` is not directly related to the problem description provided. However, based on the problem description, the input variables are `n` and `m`, which are positive integers representing the upper limits of the ranges for `a` and `b` respectively. There are `t` test cases, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`, and for each test case, `1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6`. The sum of `n` and `m` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^6.
