Let's analyze the provided Python program and determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:

The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
- 1 ≤ a ≤ n
- 1 ≤ b ≤ m
- a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

### Solution Approach:

The key to solving this problem efficiently lies in understanding the condition `a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)`. This can be simplified as follows:

1. Let `g = gcd(a, b)`.
2. Then `a = g * x` and `b = g * y` where `gcd(x, y) = 1`.
3. The condition becomes: `g * x + g * y` is a multiple of `g * y * g` which simplifies to `x + y` is a multiple of `g * y`.
4. Further simplification gives: `x + y` is a multiple of `y` which means `x` must be a multiple of `y`.

Thus, for each `b` in the range [1, m], we need to count the number of `a` in the range [1, n] such that `a` is a multiple of `b`.

### Implementation Analysis:

Let's look at the provided code:

- **Function 15 (`func_15`)**: This function appears to calculate the number of valid pairs for a given `n` and `m`.
- **Function 16 (`func_16`)**: This function processes multiple test cases by calling `func_15` for each test case.

The core logic for counting the number of valid pairs is in `func_15`:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

However, this implementation does not correctly count the number of valid pairs. The logic in `func_15` seems to be incorrect for the given problem. It does not properly iterate over all possible values of `b` and count the multiples of `b` up to `n`.

### Correct Implementation:

A correct implementation would involve iterating over all possible values of `b` and counting the multiples of `b` up to `n`. Here is a corrected version of the `func_15` function:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    ans = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        ans += (n // b)
    return ans
```

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
