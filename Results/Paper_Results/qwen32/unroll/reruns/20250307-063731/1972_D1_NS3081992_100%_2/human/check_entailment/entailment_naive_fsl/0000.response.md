Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. The function `func_15()` is supposed to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the current implementation of `func_15()` does not accurately perform this task.

The logic in `func_15()` seems to be an attempt to count pairs based on a loop that iterates through possible values of \(i\) and checks divisibility conditions, but it does not correctly account for all valid pairs \((a, b)\).

To illustrate why the code is incorrect, let's consider a simple test case:

For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), the valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions are:
- \((1, 1)\) because \(1 + 1 = 2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\)
- \((2, 1)\) because \(2 + 1 = 3\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\)
- \((2, 2)\) because \(2 + 2 = 4\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\)

So, the expected output for this test case is 3. However, the current implementation of `func_15()` would not produce the correct result for this test case or many others.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
