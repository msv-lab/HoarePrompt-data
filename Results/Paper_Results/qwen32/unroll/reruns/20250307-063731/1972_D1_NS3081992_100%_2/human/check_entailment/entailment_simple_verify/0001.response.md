### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided `func_15` function does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the given conditions. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The problem requires finding pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Condition Simplification**:
   - Let \(g = \gcd(a, b)\). Then \(a = g \cdot x\) and \(b = g \cdot y\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
   - The condition becomes: \(g \cdot x + g \cdot y\) is a multiple of \(g \cdot y \cdot g\), which simplifies to \(x + y\) is a multiple of \(g \cdot y\).
   - Further simplification gives: \(x + y\) is a multiple of \(y\), which means \(x\) must be a multiple of \(y\).

3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The core logic for counting the number of valid pairs is in `func_15`:
     ```python
     def func_15():
         (n, m) = func_7()
         i = 1
         ans = 0
         while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
             ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
             i += 1
         return ans - 1
     ```
   - This logic does not correctly iterate over all possible values of \(b\) and count the multiples of \(b\) up to \(n\).

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - A correct implementation would involve iterating over all possible values of \(b\) and counting the multiples of \(b\) up to \(n\):
     ```python
     def func_15():
         (n, m) = func_7()
         ans = 0
         for b in range(1, m + 1):
             ans += (n // b)
         return ans
     ```

5. **Verification Using Annotations**:
   - The annotations provided for `func_15` confirm that the current logic in `func_15` is incorrect. The loop condition and the calculation inside the loop do not align with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis and verification using the annotations, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Final: False**
