Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect for the given problem. The program does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob where Alice tries to maximize the MEX and Bob tries to minimize it.

The logic in `func_1` does not take into account the turns of Alice and Bob. Instead, it greedily reduces the count of numbers starting from 0, which does not represent optimal play by both players.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the strategy of both players. Essentially, Alice will try to add the smallest possible number not yet in `c` that Bob hasn't removed, and Bob will try to remove numbers that Alice might add next.

A correct approach would involve counting the occurrences of each number and then simulating the turns of Alice and Bob to determine the final MEX. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import collections as c

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the occurrences of each number
    nums = c.Counter(arr)
    
    # Initialize MEX
    mex = 0
    
    # Simulate the game
    while True:
        # Alice's turn: Add the current mex if possible
        if nums[mex] > 0:
            nums[mex] -= 1
        else:
            break
        
        # Bob's turn: Remove any number (we can just decrement mex if possible)
        mex += 1
        while mex in nums and nums[mex] == 0:
            mex += 1
    
    print(mex)
```

This program correctly simulates the game by having Alice add the smallest possible MEX and Bob removing any number, effectively leading to the correct final MEX after all elements are processed.
