The code snippet provided initializes a variable `start` to 0. It does not affect the variables `arr` or `nums`. Therefore, the initial state of `arr` and `nums` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`; `nums` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `arr`; `start` is 0.**
