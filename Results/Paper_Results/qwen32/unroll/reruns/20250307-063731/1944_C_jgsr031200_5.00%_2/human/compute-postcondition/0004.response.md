To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's analyze the behavior of the loop given the initial state and the code provided.

### Initial State:
- `arr`: List of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`.
- `nums`: A `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
- `start`: 0
- `vis`: An empty set.

### Loop Code:
```python
while nums.get(start, 0):
    vis.add(start)
    nums[start] -= 1
    if nums.get(start + 1, 0):
        nums[start + 1] -= 1
        start += 1
    else:
        print(start + 1)
        return
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The loop starts with `start` set to 0.
2. **Condition**: The loop continues as long as `nums[start]` is greater than 0.
3. **Body**:
   - `vis.add(start)`: Adds the current `start` value to the `vis` set.
   - `nums[start] -= 1`: Decreases the count of `start` in the `nums` counter by 1.
   - **Inner Condition**:
     - If `nums[start + 1]` is greater than 0:
       - `nums[start + 1] -= 1`: Decreases the count of `start + 1` in the `nums` counter by 1.
       - `start += 1`: Increments `start` by 1.
     - Else:
       - `print(start + 1)`: Prints `start + 1`.
       - `return`: Exits the function.

### Key Points:
- The loop will continue to increment `start` as long as both `start` and `start + 1` have non-zero counts in `nums`.
- When `start + 1` has a count of 0, the loop prints `start + 1` and exits.

### Output State:
- The loop will print the first integer `start + 1` for which `nums[start + 1]` is 0.
- The `vis` set will contain all the values of `start` that were processed before the loop exited.
- The `nums` counter will have decremented the counts of the processed values.
- The `start` variable will be the last value processed before the loop exited.

### Conclusion:
The loop will terminate when it encounters a value `start` such that `nums[start + 1]` is 0. At this point, `start + 1` will be printed, and the function will return.

### Output State:
Output State: **The loop prints the first integer `start + 1` for which `nums[start + 1]` is 0. The `vis` set contains all processed `start` values, and the `nums` counter has decremented the counts of these values. The `start` variable holds the last processed value.**

In natural language: The loop will print the first integer `start + 1` that does not have a subsequent value in the `nums` counter. The `vis` set will include all the `start` values that were processed, and the `nums` counter will reflect the decremented counts of these values. The `start` variable will be the last value processed before the loop exits.
