Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` as input, where each integer is between 0 and the length of the list minus one. It processes the list and prints the smallest integer `x` such that `x` or `x-1` does not appear in the list, or the largest integer processed if all integers up to that point are present. The function modifies the list indirectly through a counter and a set but does not return a value; instead, it outputs the result directly.**
