### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code systematically, using the function summary and the original assessment.

#### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective**: Determine the final score (MEX) of the game where Alice and Bob play optimally.
- **Rules**:
  - Alice starts and picks an element to append to `c` and remove from `a`.
  - Bob picks an element to remove from `a`.
  - The game continues until `a` is empty.
  - Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c`.
  - Bob aims to minimize the MEX of `c`.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
- The code reads multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and the array `arr`.
- It calls `func_1(arr)` to determine the final score.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- **Function Summary**: The summary suggests that `func_1` processes the list and prints the smallest integer `x` such that `x` or `x-1` does not appear in the list, or the largest integer processed if all integers up to that point are present.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - It uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each number in `arr`.
  - It initializes `start` to 0 and a set `vis` to keep track of visited numbers.
  - It iterates, decrementing the count of the current `start` and `start + 1` if they exist, and increments `start` if `start + 1` exists.
  - It prints `start + 1` when it cannot find `start` or `start + 1` in `arr`.

#### Issues with the Provided Code:
- **Incorrect Function Call**: The function `func_1` is defined after it is called, which would result in a `NameError`. However, in the provided code, the function is defined before it is called, so this issue is not present.
- **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**: The code does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. It simply processes the list without considering their strategies.
- **Logic for MEX Calculation**: The logic for calculating the MEX does not account for the turn-based strategy. Alice should maximize the MEX, while Bob should minimize it.

#### Corrected Code:
The original assessment suggests a corrected version of the code that simulates the turns of Alice and Bob:
- Alice picks the smallest available number to maximize the MEX.
- Bob picks any available number to minimize the MEX.
- The MEX is calculated after the game ends.

#### Evaluation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. It simply processes the list without simulating the turns, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not simulate the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob, leading to incorrect MEX calculations.
