Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a`. Alice aims to maximize the MEX of the resulting array `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

### Strategy Analysis

1. **Alice's Goal**: Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c`. To do this, she should aim to include as many small integers as possible in `c`.
2. **Bob's Goal**: Bob wants to minimize the MEX of the array `c`. To do this, he should try to prevent Alice from including small integers in `c`.

### Key Insight

The optimal strategy for Alice is to always pick the smallest available integer that is not yet in `c` or has not been paired with another instance of the same integer. This ensures that she is maximizing the MEX by filling in the smallest gaps as quickly as possible.

### Code Analysis

Let's break down the provided code:

1. **Reading Input**: The code reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.
2. **Counting Elements**: It uses `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array.
3. **Simulating the Game**: The code simulates the game by iterating through the smallest integers and checking if they can be added to `c`:
   - If `start` (the current smallest integer) is available in `nums`, it is added to `vis` (visited set).
   - If `start + 1` is also available, it is added to `vis`, and `start` is incremented.
   - If `start + 1` is not available, the MEX is `start + 1`, and the function prints it and returns.
4. **Termination**: If the loop completes without finding a missing integer, the MEX is `start`.

### Correctness Verification

The code correctly simulates the game by always trying to fill in the smallest possible integers first. This strategy ensures that the MEX is maximized under Alice's optimal play.

### Conclusion

The provided code correctly implements the strategy to find the MEX of the array `c` when both players play optimally. Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
