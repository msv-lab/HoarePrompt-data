To determine what will be printed when the `print(start)` statement is executed, we need to understand the context and the state of the variables involved based on the initial state description.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Loop Objective**: The loop is designed to find the first integer `start + 1` for which `nums[start + 1]` is 0.
2. **`vis` Set**: This set contains all the `start` values that have been processed.
3. **`nums` Counter**: This counter has decremented the counts of the processed values.
4. **`start` Variable**: This variable holds the last processed value.

### Key Points:
- The loop continues until it finds a `start` such that `nums[start + 1]` is 0.
- Once such a `start` is found, the loop presumably terminates, and the `print(start)` statement is executed.

### Conclusion:
When the `print(start)` statement is executed, it will print the last `start` value that was processed, which is the value that satisfies the condition `nums[start + 1] == 0`.

### Output:
Since the exact value of `start` is not explicitly given, we describe it based on the condition that it satisfies:
- `start + 1` is the index in the `nums` list where the value is 0.
- `start` is the last processed value before the loop terminates.

Output: **start (where start is the last processed value such that nums[start + 1] is 0)**
