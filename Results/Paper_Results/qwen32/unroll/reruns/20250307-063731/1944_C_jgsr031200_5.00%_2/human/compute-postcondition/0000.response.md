The code snippet creates a `Counter` object from the list `arr` and assigns it to the variable `nums`. The `Counter` object is a dictionary subclass from the `collections` module that counts the occurrences of each element in the list.

Given the initial state, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`. After executing the code, `nums` will be a dictionary-like object where the keys are the unique elements from `arr` and the values are the counts of those elements in `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`; `nums` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `arr`.**
