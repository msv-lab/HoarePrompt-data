### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and annotations to verify the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Analysis:
The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns to pick elements from an array `a`. Alice aims to maximize the MEX of the resulting array `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

#### Strategy Analysis:
1. **Alice's Goal**: To maximize the MEX, Alice should aim to include as many small integers as possible in `c`.
2. **Bob's Goal**: To minimize the MEX, Bob should try to prevent Alice from including small integers in `c`.

The optimal strategy for Alice is to always pick the smallest available integer that is not yet in `c` or has not been paired with another instance of the same integer.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**: The code correctly reads multiple test cases and the array `arr` for each test case.
2. **Counting Elements**: It uses `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array.
3. **Simulating the Game**:
   - The code initializes `start` to 0 and uses a `vis` set to keep track of visited integers.
   - It iterates through the smallest integers and checks if they can be added to `c`:
     - If `start` is available in `nums`, it is added to `vis`.
     - If `start + 1` is also available, it is added to `vis`, and `start` is incremented.
     - If `start + 1` is not available, the MEX is `start + 1`, and the function prints it and returns.
4. **Termination**: If the loop completes without finding a missing integer, the MEX is `start`.

#### Annotations:
The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points:
- Before the function call, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`.
- The loop prints the first integer `start + 1` for which `nums[start + 1]` is 0. The `vis` set contains all processed `start` values, and the `nums` counter has decremented the counts of these values. The `start` variable holds the last processed value.

#### Correctness Verification:
The code correctly simulates the game by always trying to fill in the smallest possible integers first. This strategy ensures that the MEX is maximized under Alice's optimal play.

#### Example Verification:
Let's verify the example provided in the problem statement:
1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `arr = [0, 0, 1, 1]`
   - The code will iterate and find that `start = 0` is available, then `start + 1 = 1` is also available. After processing, `start` will be 1, and `start + 1 = 2` will be the MEX.
   - Output: `2`
2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `arr = [0, 1, 2, 3]`
   - The code will iterate and find that `start = 0` is available, then `start + 1 = 1` is available, and so on until `start = 3` is available. After processing, `start` will be 3, and `start + 1 = 4` will be the MEX.
   - Output: `1`
3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `arr = [1, 1]`
   - The code will iterate and find that `start = 0` is not available, so `start + 1 = 1` is the MEX.
   - Output: `0`

These outputs match the expected results, confirming the correctness of the code.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the strategy to find the MEX of the array `c` when both players play optimally.

#### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
