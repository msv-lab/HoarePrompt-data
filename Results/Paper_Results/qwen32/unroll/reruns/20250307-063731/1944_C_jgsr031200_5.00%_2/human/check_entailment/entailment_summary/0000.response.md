### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine if the solution is correct.

**Problem Breakdown:**
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from the array `a`.
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the final array `c`.
- Bob wants to minimize the MEX of the final array `c`.
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

**Optimal Strategy:**
- Alice's optimal strategy is to always pick the smallest possible number that hasn't been picked yet, provided Bob doesn't pick it.
- Bob's optimal strategy is to prevent Alice from picking the smallest possible number that hasn't been picked yet.

**Key Insight:**
- If a number `x` is present in the array, and the number `x-1` is also present, Alice can ensure that `x` is added to `c` by picking `x` or `x-1` (whichever Bob doesn't pick).
- The game essentially revolves around which numbers are present and how they are picked.

**Solution Analysis:**
- The solution uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each number.
- It iterates through numbers starting from `0` and checks if the current number and the next number are present.
- If the current number `start` is present, it is added to the set `vis`, and its count is decremented.
- If the next number `start + 1` is also present, its count is decremented, and `start` is incremented.
- If `start + 1` is not present, `start + 1` is the MEX, and the function prints it and returns.

**Correctness Verification:**
- The function correctly identifies the smallest number that cannot be formed by the sequence of picking elements optimally.
- The use of `Counter` and `set` ensures that the function efficiently checks for the presence of numbers and updates counts.
- The logic correctly handles the condition where Alice and Bob are picking elements optimally, ensuring that the MEX is calculated based on the optimal play.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution appears to correctly determine the MEX of the final array `c` based on the optimal play by Alice and Bob. The execution summary aligns with the expected behavior of the solution.

**Correctness: True**
