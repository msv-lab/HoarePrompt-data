### Reasoning:

The given problem involves determining the MEX (minimum excludant) of an array `c` after Alice and Bob have played a game on array `a`. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it. Both play optimally.

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes an array `arr` as input and prints the MEX of the array after the game has been played optimally. The function uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array and a `set` to keep track of processed elements.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `nums` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - `start` is initialized to 0.
   - `vis` is a set used to keep track of processed elements.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `nums[start]` is greater than 0, meaning the current `start` value is still present in `arr`.
   - `start` is added to the `vis` set.
   - The count of `start` in `nums` is decremented.
   - If `nums[start + 1]` is greater than 0, it means `start + 1` is also present in `arr`. The count of `start + 1` in `nums` is decremented, and `start` is incremented to `start + 1`.
   - If `nums[start + 1]` is 0, it means `start + 1` is not present in `arr`, and the function prints `start + 1` and returns.

3. **Termination**:
   - If the loop terminates without finding a missing element, it prints `start`, which is the last processed value.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the MEX Calculation**:
  - The loop effectively finds the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `arr` by checking the presence of consecutive integers starting from 0.
  - The use of `nums` and `vis` ensures that the function correctly counts and tracks the elements in `arr`.

- **Optimal Play**:
  - The function does not explicitly simulate the game between Alice and Bob. However, since the MEX is determined by the presence of consecutive integers in `arr`, the function implicitly models the optimal play by finding the smallest missing integer.
  - Both players' strategies (Alice maximizing and Bob minimizing) are indirectly considered because the MEX calculation inherently reflects the smallest missing integer, which is the optimal outcome for both players when playing optimally.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly calculates the MEX of the array `arr` after the game has been played optimally by both players. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
