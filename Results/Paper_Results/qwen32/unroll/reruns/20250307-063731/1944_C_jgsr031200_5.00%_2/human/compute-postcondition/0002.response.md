The code snippet initializes a new set called `vis`. This does not affect the existing variables `arr`, `nums`, and `start`. The new set `vis` is empty at the start.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`; `nums` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `arr`; `start` is 0; `vis` is an empty set.**
