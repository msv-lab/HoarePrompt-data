Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the game's final score based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Function Call**: The function `func_1(arr)` is called within the loop but is defined after the loop. This will result in a `NameError` because `func_1` is not recognized at the point where it is called.

2. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**: The current implementation of `func_1(arr)` does not consider the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it. The code simply counts the occurrences of each number and tries to construct the array `c` by incrementing the MEX, but it does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob.

3. **Logic for MEX Calculation**: The current logic for calculating the MEX does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob take turns. Alice will always choose a number that maximizes the MEX, while Bob will choose a number that minimizes it. The current implementation does not reflect this turn-based strategy.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the game with the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import collections as c

def mex(arr):
    i = 0
    while True:
        if i not in arr:
            return i
        i += 1

def func_1(arr):
    nums = c.Counter(arr)
    start = 0
    vis = set()
    turn = 0  # 0 for Alice, 1 for Bob
    while True:
        if turn == 0:  # Alice's turn
            found = False
            for num in range(start, len(arr)):
                if nums.get(num, 0) > 0:
                    nums[num] -= 1
                    vis.add(num)
                    start = num + 1
                    found = True
                    break
            if not found:
                break
        else:  # Bob's turn
            found = False
            for num in range(start, len(arr)):
                if nums.get(num, 0) > 0:
                    nums[num] -= 1
                    found = True
                    break
            if not found:
                break
        turn = 1 - turn
    print(mex(vis))

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(arr)
```

In this corrected version:
- We simulate the turns of Alice and Bob.
- Alice tries to maximize the MEX by choosing the smallest available number that hasn't been used yet.
- Bob tries to minimize the MEX by choosing any available number.
- We keep track of the numbers used in the set `vis` and calculate the MEX after the game ends.

This corrected version should handle the problem description correctly for all potential cases.
