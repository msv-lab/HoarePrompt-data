### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of determining the final MEX score of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally on the array `a`. The solution uses a `Counter` to keep track of the occurrences of each number in `a` and iteratively determines the smallest number that cannot be included in `c` by simulating the game.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `nums` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each number in the input array `arr`.
   - `start` is initialized to 0.
   - `vis` is an empty set that will keep track of the numbers that have been processed.

2. **Processing**:
   - The `while` loop continues as long as `nums[start]` is non-zero, meaning there are still occurrences of `start` in the array.
   - Inside the loop, `start` is added to the `vis` set.
   - The count of `start` in `nums` is decremented by 1.
   - The program then checks if `nums[start + 1]` is non-zero. If it is, the count of `start + 1` is decremented by 1, and `start` is incremented by 1.
   - If `nums[start + 1]` is zero, the loop breaks, and the program prints `start + 1` as the MEX score.

3. **Termination**:
   - If the loop terminates without finding a zero count for `start + 1`, the program prints `start` as the MEX score.

This approach ensures that the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c` is found efficiently by leveraging the `Counter` and a simple loop.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Optimal Play**:
  - Alice and Bob play optimally, meaning Alice tries to maximize the MEX score while Bob tries to minimize it.
  - The strategy implemented in the program aligns with the optimal play by ensuring that the smallest possible number is added to `c` whenever possible, and the game ends when the next smallest number cannot be added.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles cases where all numbers are the same (e.g., `[1, 1, 1]`), resulting in a MEX score of 0.
  - It also handles cases where the numbers are consecutive (e.g., `[0, 1, 2, 3]`), resulting in a MEX score of 4.

- **Complexity**:
  - The time complexity of the solution is O(n) per test case, which is efficient given the constraints (total sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5).

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX score after Alice and Bob have played optimally. It efficiently handles the given constraints and edge cases.

**Correctness: True**
