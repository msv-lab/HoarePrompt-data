Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in a tree and `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5. The function returns the number of connected components in the tree after removing `k` edges.**
