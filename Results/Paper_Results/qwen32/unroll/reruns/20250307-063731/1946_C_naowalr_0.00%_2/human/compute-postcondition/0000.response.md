The code reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, `t` is the integer read from the input.**
