You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

- Function Summary: 
The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. For each test case, the function calculates and prints the area of the square.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners, which are provided in random order.
- The sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes.
- The area of the square is the side length squared.
- The program should handle multiple test cases.

### Provided Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
    - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
    - For each test case, it reads four lines of coordinates and stores them in a list `coord`.

2. **Sorting the Coordinates:**
    - The program sorts the coordinates. Sorting the coordinates helps in identifying pairs of adjacent points that form the sides of the square.

3. **Calculating the Side Length:**
    - The program calculates the squared distance between the first two points `p1` and the last two points `p2`. 
    - It then takes the square root of each squared distance to get the actual side lengths and multiplies them to get the area.
    - However, this approach has a flaw. The side lengths should be the same, and we only need to calculate one of them.

4. **Output:**
    - The program prints the area of the square, which is the side length squared.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The sorting step ensures that the points are in a consistent order, but it does not guarantee that the first two points or the last two points form the sides of the square.
- The calculation of the area using the product of two side lengths is incorrect. The correct approach is to calculate the distance between two adjacent points (which should be the same for all sides of the square) and then square that distance to get the area.
- The program should calculate the distance between two adjacent points (e.g., `coord[1]` and `coord[0]` or `coord[3]` and `coord[2]`) and then square this distance to get the area.

### Corrected Approach:
- Calculate the distance between two adjacent points.
- Square this distance to get the area of the square.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it incorrectly calculates the area of the square by multiplying the side lengths instead of squaring one of them.

Correctness: **False**
