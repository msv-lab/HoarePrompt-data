To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all iterations, let's break down the provided code and understand its behavior.

The initial state includes:
- `n`: the number of test cases.
- `t`: the number of test cases (though `t` is not used in the provided loop).
- For each test case, there are four lines of input, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.

The loop processes each test case as follows:
1. It initializes an empty list `coord` to store the coordinates of the corners.
2. It reads four pairs of coordinates and appends them to the `coord` list.
3. The list `coord` is sorted, which organizes the coordinates presumably in a way that makes it easier to compute the side lengths of the square.
4. It calculates the squared distances between two pairs of adjacent corners (`p1` and `p2`).
5. It computes the area of the square by taking the square root of `p1` and `p2`, multiplying them, and then rounding the result to the nearest integer.
6. It prints the rounded result.
7. It decrements `n` by 1, moving to the next test case.

After the loop finishes executing all iterations (i.e., when `n` becomes 0), the following variables will have the following states:
- `n`: 0 (since it has been decremented for each test case).
- `t`: remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `coord`, `res`, `p1`, and `p2`: These variables are local to the loop and will not retain their values after the loop finishes. They will be re-initialized for each iteration.

The output state will consist of the printed values for each test case, which are the rounded areas of the squares.

Output State: **The value of `n` is 0, and the values of `coord`, `res`, `p1`, and `p2` are not retained. The rounded areas of the squares for each test case have been printed.**
