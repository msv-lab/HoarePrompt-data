test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four tuples, and each tuple contains two integers x_i, y_i representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates satisfy -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. It is guaranteed that the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
