### Reasoning:

The task is to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. The program reads multiple test cases, and for each test case, it reads four lines of input, each containing the coordinates of a corner of the square. The program then calculates the area of the square and prints it.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads four lines of input, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of a corner of the square.

2. **Sorting Coordinates:**
   - The coordinates are stored in a list `coord` and then sorted. Sorting helps in easily identifying the sides of the square.

3. **Calculating Side Lengths:**
   - The program calculates the squared distance between two adjacent corners (which should be the same for all sides of a square) using the formula \((x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2\).
   - It calculates this distance for two pairs of adjacent corners (`p1` and `p2`).

4. **Calculating Area:**
   - The area of the square is the square of the side length. However, the program incorrectly calculates the area by multiplying the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, which is not the correct approach. Instead, it should take the square root of either `p1` or `p2` and then square it to get the area.
   - The program then prints the rounded result.

### Correctness:

The program is incorrect because it calculates the area incorrectly. Instead of taking the square root of one of the squared distances and squaring it back, it multiplies the square roots of the two squared distances. This will not yield the correct area of the square.

**Correctness: False**

To correct the program, the calculation of the area should be:
```python
side_length_squared = p1  # or p2, since they should be equal
area = side_length_squared
print(area)
```

This will ensure that the area is calculated correctly as the square of the side length.
