The code provided is simply reading an integer input and assigning it to the variable `n`. Since no further operations are performed on `n` or any other variables in the provided snippet, the only change is the assignment of `n` to the input value. The initial state specifies that `n` is 0, but this value is overwritten by the input. The other variables (`t`, `x_i`, `y_i`, and `s`) are mentioned but not modified by this snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, each test case consists of four lines with two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (-1000 ≤ `x_i`, `y_i` ≤ 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, and `s` is calculated and printed based on the input for each test case.**
