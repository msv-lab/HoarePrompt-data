### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine its correctness. The main function `func_1` is supposed to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

The provided program uses a nested loop structure to iterate over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) and checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If this condition is met, it increments the count `cnt` by the minimum of two calculated values. However, this logic does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as required by the problem.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Loop Conditions and Logic:**
   - The outer loop runs while \(x \cdot x \le n\).
   - The inner loop runs while \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
   - The condition \(\gcd(x, y) == 1\) is checked, but this does not guarantee that \((x, y)\) is a valid pair \((a, b)\) that satisfies \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\).

2. **Counting Valid Pairs:**
   - The increment to `cnt` is done using `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`, which is not a valid way to count the number of valid pairs. This formula does not correctly account for all pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions.

3. **Example Test Case:**
   - For the test case `2 3`, the expected output is `1` because the only valid pair is `(2, 3)`. However, the provided program does not correctly identify this pair.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\). This can be optimized using mathematical properties and constraints, but the provided code does not follow this approach.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided program is incorrect. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
