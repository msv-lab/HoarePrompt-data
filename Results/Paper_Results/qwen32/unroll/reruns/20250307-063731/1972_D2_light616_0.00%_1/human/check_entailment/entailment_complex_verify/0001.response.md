### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotations to determine if the program correctly solves the problem described.

#### Problem Recap:

We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

#### Program Analysis:

The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: Handles a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: Handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each.

#### `func_1()` Analysis:

- **Outer Loop**: Iterates over \(x\) from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\).
- **Inner Loop**: Iterates over \(y\) from 1 with conditions \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
- **Condition Check**: If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments the count by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

### Flaws in `func_1()`:

1. **Incorrect Pair Representation**: The loops iterate over \(x\) and \(y\) but do not directly represent pairs \((a, b)\). Instead, they seem to be trying to find pairs that satisfy specific conditions related to \(x\) and \(y\) being coprime and the product conditions, which do not directly translate to the problem's requirement.

2. **Logic for Counting Pairs**: The increment of the count using the minimum of the two floor divisions does not correspond to a correct method for counting valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \equiv 0 \pmod{a + b}\). The program does not systematically check all pairs \((a, b)\) within the given ranges.

3. **Annotations**: The annotations describe the state of the program but do not provide a clear explanation of how the logic in `func_1()` correctly maps to the problem's requirements. The annotations seem to misinterpret the loop conditions and the purpose of the count increment.

### `func_2()` Analysis:

- **Correct**: `func_2()` correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the logic in `func_1()` is fundamentally flawed and does not correctly solve the problem. The program does not properly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

#### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
