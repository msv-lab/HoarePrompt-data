To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand what the loop does and how it modifies the variables.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Outer Loop (`while x * x <= n`)**: This loop runs as long as the square of `x` is less than or equal to `n`. It starts with `x = 1` and increments `x` by 1 in each iteration.
2. **Inner Loop (`while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m`)**: For each `x`, this loop runs as long as the product `(x + y) * x` is less than or equal to `n` and the product `(x + y) * y` is less than or equal to `m`. It starts with `y = 1` and increments `y` by 1 in each iteration.
3. **Condition (`if math.gcd(x, y) == 1`)**: Inside the inner loop, it checks if `x` and `y` are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). If they are, it increments `cnt` by the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.

### Final State:
After all iterations, the loop will have finished when `x * x` exceeds `n`. The variables `x`, `y`, and `cnt` will be in their final states.

- **`x`**: This will be the smallest integer such that `x * x > n`.
- **`y`**: This will be the value it had in the last iteration of the inner loop before the inner loop condition failed.
- **`cnt`**: This will be the total count incremented during the loop based on the given conditions.

### Output State:
The exact values of `x` and `y` depend on the input values of `n` and `m`, but we can describe the final state in general terms.

- `x` will be the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`.
- `y` will be the value it had in the last iteration of the inner loop.
- `cnt` will reflect the total count of valid pairs `(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are coprime and satisfy the given conditions.

Given the format requirement, here is the output state:

Output State: **`x` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`, `y` is the value from the last iteration of the inner loop, and `cnt` is the total count of valid pairs `(x, y)`.**

In simpler terms:
- `x` will be the smallest integer such that `x * x > n`.
- `y` will be the last value it took in the inner loop before the loop condition failed.
- `cnt` will be the total number of valid pairs `(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are coprime and meet the specified conditions.
