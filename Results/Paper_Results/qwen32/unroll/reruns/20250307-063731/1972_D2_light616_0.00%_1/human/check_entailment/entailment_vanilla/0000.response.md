Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

### Program Analysis

The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function calculates the number of valid pairs for a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

#### `func_1()` Analysis

The function `func_1()` uses a nested loop to iterate over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) (which are supposed to represent \(a\) and \(b\), respectively). Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Outer Loop**: Iterates over possible values of \(x\) from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\).
2. **Inner Loop**: Iterates over possible values of \(y\) starting from 1, with the condition that \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
3. **Condition Check**: If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments the count by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

However, the logic here seems flawed. The condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) and the way the count is incremented do not correctly cover all valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the problem's conditions.

#### `func_2()` Analysis

The function `func_2()` correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`. However, since `func_1()` itself is flawed, the entire program will not produce correct results.

### Correctness

Given the analysis above, the program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_1()` is incorrect, and it does not properly account for all valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
