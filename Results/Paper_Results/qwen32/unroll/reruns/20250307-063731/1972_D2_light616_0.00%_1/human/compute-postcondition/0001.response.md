The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times, the only variable we need to adjust for the loop to execute is `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of iterations. The value of `t` is already provided by the user input and is within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` itself to ensure the loop executes. The loop will execute as long as `t` is within the specified range.

Since the loop body is omitted, we don't need to consider any variables or states introduced within the loop body.

State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the user input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4**
