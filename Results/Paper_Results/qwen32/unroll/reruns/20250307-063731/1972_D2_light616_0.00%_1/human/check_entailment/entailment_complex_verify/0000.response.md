Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated version to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

### Provided Program Analysis

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).
- It initializes `x = 1` and `cnt = 0`.
- It iterates over `x` from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\).
- For each `x`, it iterates over `y` from 1 until either \((x + y) * x > n\) or \((x + y) * y > m\).
- If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments `cnt` by \(\min\left(\frac{n}{(x + y) * x}, \frac{m}{(x + y) * y}\right)\).
- Finally, it prints `cnt`.

#### Function `func_2`:
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- It calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Annotated Code Analysis
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- Before `func_1` is called, `n` and `m` are positive integers.
- Inside `func_1`, `x` and `y` are iterated over with the specified conditions.
- The `cnt` is incremented based on the condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
- After the loops, `cnt` is printed.

### Issues with the Provided Program
The logic in `func_1` is flawed:
- The condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) only considers pairs where `x` and `y` are coprime.
- The calculation \(\min\left(\frac{n}{(x + y) * x}, \frac{m}{(x + y) * y}\right)\) does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the problem's conditions.
- The program does not check if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\) for all possible pairs \((a, b)\).

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
2. For each pair, check if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\).
3. Count the number of pairs that satisfy this condition.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as it does not properly check the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\) for all pairs \((a, b)\).

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
