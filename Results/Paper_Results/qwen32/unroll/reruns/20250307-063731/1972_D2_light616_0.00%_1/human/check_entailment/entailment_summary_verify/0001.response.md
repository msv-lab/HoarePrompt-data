### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Analysis

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

#### Program Analysis

The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function calculates the number of valid pairs for a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

##### `func_1()` Analysis

The function `func_1()` uses a nested loop to iterate over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\):
1. **Outer Loop**: Iterates over possible values of \(x\) from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\).
2. **Inner Loop**: Iterates over possible values of \(y\) starting from 1, with the condition that \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
3. **Condition Check**: If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments the count by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

The logic in `func_1()` is flawed. Here are the issues:
- The condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) restricts the pairs to those where \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, which is not a requirement of the problem. The problem does not specify that \(x\) and \(y\) must be coprime.
- The count increment logic does not correctly account for all valid pairs \((a, b)\). It incorrectly assumes that the number of valid pairs can be calculated using the minimum of the two floor divisions, which is not a valid approach to count all pairs satisfying the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \equiv 0 \pmod{a + b}\).

##### `func_2()` Analysis

The function `func_2()` correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`. However, since `func_1()` itself is flawed, the entire program will not produce correct results.

### Correctness

Given the analysis above, the program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_1()` is incorrect, and it does not properly account for all valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

### Final Evaluation

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
