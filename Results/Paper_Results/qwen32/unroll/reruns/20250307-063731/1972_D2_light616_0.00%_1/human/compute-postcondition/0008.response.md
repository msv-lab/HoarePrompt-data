Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the input, calculates and prints the total count of valid pairs `(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are positive integers, `x` is less than or equal to the square root of `n`, and the product of `(x + y) * x` is less than or equal to `n` and `(x + y) * y` is less than or equal to `m`, with the additional condition that `x` and `y` are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1).**
