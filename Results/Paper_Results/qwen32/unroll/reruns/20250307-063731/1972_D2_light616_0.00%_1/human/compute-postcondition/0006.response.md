To determine what will be printed by the `print(cnt)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the context in which `cnt` is calculated.

### Initial State Recap:
- `x` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`.
- `y` is the value from the last iteration of the inner loop.
- `cnt` is the total count of valid pairs `(x, y)`.

### Analysis:
Without the full code, we can infer that `cnt` is likely being incremented in some loop structure where valid pairs `(x, y)` are counted. The exact conditions for what constitutes a "valid pair" are not given, but we can still describe the output based on the provided information.

### Determining the Output:
- `cnt` is a count of valid pairs `(x, y)`.
- `x` is determined based on `n`, but its exact value is not specified.
- `y` is determined in the context of the inner loop, but its exact value is not specified.
- The value of `cnt` depends on the number of iterations and the conditions inside the loop that increment it.

Since the exact conditions and loop structure are not provided, we can only describe `cnt` in terms of its definition.

### Final Answer:
The `print(cnt)` statement will output the total count of valid pairs `(x, y)` as determined by the loop structure and conditions in the code.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the total count of valid pairs (x, y) determined by the loop structure and conditions in the code)**
