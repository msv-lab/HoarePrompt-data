To determine the output state after the loop executes all its iterations, let's analyze the given loop and its components:

1. **Initial State:** The variable `t` is an integer value provided by the user input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
2. **Loop Definition:** The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t): func_1()`. This means the loop will execute `func_1()` `t` times.

Since the loop body only consists of the function call `func_1()`, and there is no information about what `func_1()` does, we can only make inferences based on the loop structure itself. The loop does not modify `t` or any other variables outside of its body. Therefore, after the loop finishes executing, the value of `t` remains unchanged.

**Output State:** The only variable in the initial state is `t`, and it will remain the same after the loop completes because the loop does not modify `t`. All other variables (if any) that are not part of the loop head or body remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the same integer value provided by the user input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.**
