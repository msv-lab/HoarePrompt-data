Precondition: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4.**

(Note: The function `func_2` does not directly use `n` or `m`, but they are part of the input for each test case as described in the problem statement. However, based on the variables in the function signature, only `t` is mentioned.)
