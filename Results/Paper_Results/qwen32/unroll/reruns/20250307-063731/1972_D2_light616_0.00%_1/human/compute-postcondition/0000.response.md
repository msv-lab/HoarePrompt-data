The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, after executing the code, `t` will be updated to the integer value provided by the user input. The precondition that `1 <= t <= 10^4` remains valid, meaning the input value must still fall within this range.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the user input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.**
