Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The main issue lies in the logic and the implementation of the `func_1` function. Here are some points that indicate the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Loop Conditions**: The loop conditions in `func_1` are not correctly set up to cover all possible pairs `(a, b)` where `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`. The conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are too restrictive and do not ensure that all valid pairs are considered.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Counts**: The calculation `cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is incorrect. The program should check for each pair `(a, b)` if `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` and count the valid pairs accordingly.

3. **Handling of GCD Condition**: The program only checks if `gcd(x, y) == 1` and then calculates the count based on that condition, which is not sufficient to solve the problem as stated.

Here is a corrected version of the function that properly checks all pairs `(a, b)` and counts the valid ones:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (b * math.gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

# Example usage:
# func_2()
```

This corrected version iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the given ranges and checks if the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` holds true, counting the number of valid pairs. This approach ensures that all pairs are considered and the correct count is returned.
