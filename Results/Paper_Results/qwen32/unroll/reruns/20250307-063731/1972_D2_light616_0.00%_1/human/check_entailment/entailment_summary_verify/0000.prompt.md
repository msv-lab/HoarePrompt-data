You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, then calls `func_1` for each test case. It does not return any value but presumably performs operations based on the test cases.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The main issue lies in the logic of the function `func_1` which is supposed to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

The current implementation of `func_1` incorrectly calculates the count of valid pairs. Specifically, the following issues are present:

1. The loop conditions and logic for counting valid pairs are incorrect.
2. The calculation of `cnt` does not properly account for all valid pairs (a, b) within the constraints.
3. The use of `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is not an accurate way to count the valid pairs.

Let's consider a simple test case to illustrate the issue:

### Test Case:
```
1
2 3
```

### Expected Output:
```
1
```

### Explanation of Expected Output:
The only valid pair (a, b) that satisfies the conditions is (2, 3):
- \(1 \le 2 \le 2\)
- \(1 \le 3 \le 3\)
- \(3 \cdot \gcd(2, 3) = 3 \cdot 1 = 3\) is a multiple of \(2 + 3 = 5\), which is not true. However, there is no other pair (a, b) that satisfies the conditions.

### Actual Output of Provided Program:
The provided program will not correctly count the valid pairs for this test case or any other test case due to the flawed logic.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs (a, b) and checking the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\). This can be optimized using mathematical properties and constraints, but the provided code does not follow this approach.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
