### Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

Let's analyze the provided functions:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to zero.
   - It iterates over values of `x` from 1 up to the square root of `n`.
   - For each `x`, it iterates over values of `y` starting from 1, ensuring \((x + y) * x \le n\) and \((x + y) * y \le m\).
   - If `x` and `y` are coprime (i.e., \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\)), it increments the counter `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) * x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) * y} \right\rfloor\).
   - Finally, it prints the counter `cnt`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1`.

The logic in `func_1` seems to be attempting to count the valid pairs based on the given conditions, but there is a critical issue with the logic. Specifically, the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) is not directly addressed by the logic in `func_1`. The provided code only checks if `x` and `y` are coprime and then increments the count based on the constraints, which does not fully capture the required condition.

### Correctness:

Given the problem description and the provided execution summaries, the logic in `func_1` does not correctly implement the required condition for counting valid pairs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
