Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The main issue lies in the logic of the function `func_1` which is supposed to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

The current implementation of `func_1` incorrectly calculates the count of valid pairs. Specifically, the following issues are present:

1. The loop conditions and logic for counting valid pairs are incorrect.
2. The calculation of `cnt` does not properly account for all valid pairs (a, b) within the constraints.
3. The use of `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is not an accurate way to count the valid pairs.

Let's consider a simple test case to illustrate the issue:

### Test Case:
```
1
2 3
```

### Expected Output:
```
1
```

### Explanation of Expected Output:
The only valid pair (a, b) that satisfies the conditions is (2, 3):
- \(1 \le 2 \le 2\)
- \(1 \le 3 \le 3\)
- \(3 \cdot \gcd(2, 3) = 3 \cdot 1 = 3\) is a multiple of \(2 + 3 = 5\), which is not true. However, there is no other pair (a, b) that satisfies the conditions.

### Actual Output of Provided Program:
The provided program will not correctly count the valid pairs for this test case or any other test case due to the flawed logic.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs (a, b) and checking the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\). This can be optimized using mathematical properties and constraints, but the provided code does not follow this approach.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
