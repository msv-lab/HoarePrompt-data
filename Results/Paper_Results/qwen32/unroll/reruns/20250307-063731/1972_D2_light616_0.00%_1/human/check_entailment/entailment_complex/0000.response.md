Reasoning: 

The provided code is intended to solve the problem of counting the number of valid ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions for multiple test cases. Let's break down the logic and see if it aligns with the problem statement:

1. **Function `func_1`:** This function is responsible for processing a single test case. It reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input. It then iterates over possible values of `x` and `y` to count the pairs that satisfy the conditions. Specifically:
   - It iterates `x` from 1 up to the square root of `n`.
   - For each `x`, it iterates `y` from 1 upwards.
   - It checks if the sum `(x + y) * x` is less than or equal to `n` and `(x + y) * y` is less than or equal to `m`.
   - It also checks if `x` and `y` are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1).
   - If these conditions are met, it increments the count `cnt` by the minimum of how many times `(x + y) * x` fits into `n` and how many times `(x + y) * y` fits into `m`.

2. **Function `func_2`:** This function handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case.

However, there are several issues in the logic of `func_1` that make it incorrect:

- The loop condition `(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m` does not correctly reflect the problem's condition `b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b`. The current logic does not account for the `b * gcd(a, b)` part at all.
- The increment logic `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`. It incorrectly assumes that the number of valid pairs can be counted by the minimum fit of `(x + y) * x` into `n` and `(x + y) * y` into `m`.

The intended logic does not match the problem statement. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
