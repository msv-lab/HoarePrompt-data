You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, then calls `func_1` for each test case. It does not return any value but presumably performs operations based on the test cases.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

### Program Analysis

The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function calculates the number of valid pairs for a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

#### `func_1()` Analysis

The function `func_1()` uses a nested loop to iterate over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) (which are supposed to represent \(a\) and \(b\), respectively). Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Outer Loop**: Iterates over possible values of \(x\) from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\).
2. **Inner Loop**: Iterates over possible values of \(y\) starting from 1, with the condition that \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
3. **Condition Check**: If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments the count by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

However, the logic here seems flawed. The condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) and the way the count is incremented do not correctly cover all valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the problem's conditions.

#### `func_2()` Analysis

The function `func_2()` correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`. However, since `func_1()` itself is flawed, the entire program will not produce correct results.

### Correctness

Given the analysis above, the program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_1()` is incorrect, and it does not properly account for all valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
