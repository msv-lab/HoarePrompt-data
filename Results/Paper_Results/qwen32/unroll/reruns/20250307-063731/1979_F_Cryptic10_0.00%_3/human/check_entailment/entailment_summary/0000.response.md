### Reasoning:
Let's break down the provided code and its behavior in the context of the problem description.

#### Problem Understanding:
1. **Graph Structure**: We start with a complete graph with `n` vertices, and `n-2` edges are removed.
2. **Queries**: We can ask queries of the form `"? d"`, where `d` is a non-negative integer. The response gives us:
   - `v`: The smallest-indexed vertex with degree at least `d`.
   - `u`: The smallest-indexed vertex not connected to `v` (or `0` if no such vertex exists).
3. **Objective**: Find a Hamiltonian path in the graph using at most `n` queries.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(d)`**:
   - This function sends a query `"? d"` to the system.
   - It reads the response, which includes two integers `v` and `u`.
   - It returns these two integers as a tuple.

2. **Function `func_2(n)`**:
   - This function initializes an empty list `path` to store the vertices in the Hamiltonian path.
   - It initializes a set `remaining_vertices` containing all vertices from `1` to `n`.
   - It enters a loop that continues until all vertices have been added to the path.
   - Inside the loop, it iterates over possible degrees `d` from `n-1` down to `0`.
   - For each degree `d`, it calls `func_1(d)` to get `v` and `u`.
   - If `v` is `0`, it means no vertex with degree at least `d` was found, so it continues to the next degree.
   - If `v` is found and is in `remaining_vertices`, it adds `v` to the path and removes `v` from `remaining_vertices`.
   - The loop breaks after finding and adding a vertex to the path.
   - Once all vertices are added to the path, it prints the path in the required format.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The algorithm correctly uses the query mechanism to find vertices with the required degree and ensures that each vertex is added to the path exactly once.
- The use of `remaining_vertices` ensures that the algorithm does not revisit vertices.
- The decreasing order of `d` ensures that higher-degree vertices are considered first, which is a reasonable strategy to find a Hamiltonian path.
- The algorithm terminates after finding `n` vertices, which is within the allowed `n` queries.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the strategy to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph using the allowed queries.

**Correctness: True**
