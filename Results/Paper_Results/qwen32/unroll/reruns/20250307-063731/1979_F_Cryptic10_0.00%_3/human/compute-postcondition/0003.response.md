To determine the output state after the loop finishes, let's analyze the given loop and its behavior:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n`: Number of vertices in the graph (2 <= n <= 10^5).
   - `path`: An initially empty list.
   - `remaining_vertices`: A set containing integers from 1 to n.

2. **Loop Structure**:
   - The `while` loop continues as long as `remaining_vertices` is not empty.
   - Inside the `while` loop, there is a `for` loop that iterates from `n-1` down to `0`.
   - In each iteration of the `for` loop, `func_1(d)` is called, which presumably returns a tuple `(v, u)`. The value of `u` is not used in the loop.
   - If `v` is 0, the loop continues to the next iteration.
   - If `v` is not 0 and is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is appended to `path`, removed from `remaining_vertices`, and the `for` loop is broken out of.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when `remaining_vertices` is empty, meaning all vertices have been processed.

4. **Output State**:
   - `remaining_vertices` will be an empty set since all vertices have been removed from it.
   - `path` will contain all vertices from 1 to n, in the order they were processed and removed from `remaining_vertices`.

The exact order of vertices in `path` depends on the behavior of `func_1(d)`, but generally, it will be a permutation of the set `{1, 2, ..., n}`.

**Output State: **`path` is a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]` and `remaining_vertices` is an empty set.**

In simpler terms, the output state is that all vertices have been added to `path` in some order, and `remaining_vertices` is empty because all vertices have been processed.
