The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` does not alter the values of any variables in the program. It simply flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console. Therefore, the values of `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`path` is a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]` and `remaining_vertices` is an empty set.**
