The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `d` as a parameter, which is within the range from 0 to `n-1` (where `n` is the number of vertices in a graph). It prints a query with the value of `d`, flushes the output, and then reads two integers `v` and `u` from the input. The function returns a tuple containing these two integers.
