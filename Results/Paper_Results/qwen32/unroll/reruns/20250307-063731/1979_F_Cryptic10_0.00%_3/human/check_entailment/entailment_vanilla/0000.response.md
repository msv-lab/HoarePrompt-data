Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves finding a Hamiltonian path in a graph where (n - 2) edges have been removed from a complete graph with n vertices. The solution requires making queries to the interactor to gather information about the graph's structure and then constructing the Hamiltonian path.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(d)`**:
   - Sends a query `? d` to the interactor.
   - Reads the response, which includes a vertex `v` and another vertex `u` (or 0 if no such vertex exists).
   - Returns the tuple `(v, u)`.

2. **Function `func_2(n)`**:
   - Initializes an empty path and a set of remaining vertices.
   - While there are remaining vertices, it iterates over possible degrees `d` from `n-1` down to `0`.
   - For each degree `d`, it makes a query using `func_1(d)`.
   - If the response vertex `v` is not 0 and is still in the set of remaining vertices, it adds `v` to the path and removes it from the set of remaining vertices.
   - Once all vertices are added to the path, it prints the path in the required format.

### Key Points:
- The program iterates over possible degrees in descending order, which is a reasonable strategy to find a vertex with a high degree first.
- It continues to make queries until all vertices have been added to the path.
- The program correctly handles the output format and flushes the output buffer after each query and the final answer.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not handle the case where the interactor returns `-1` (indicating an invalid query or too many queries). However, the problem guarantees that the interactor is non-adaptive and the graph does not change, so the program will not encounter this scenario if it follows the rules correctly.
- The program assumes that the interactor will always provide a valid response (other than `-1`), which is a reasonable assumption given the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correctly structured to solve the problem within the given constraints. It efficiently constructs the Hamiltonian path by leveraging the provided query mechanism.

Correctness: **True**
