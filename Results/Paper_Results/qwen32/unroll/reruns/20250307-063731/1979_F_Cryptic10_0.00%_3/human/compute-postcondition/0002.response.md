To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `remaining_vertices` is not empty. The only variable in the loop head is `remaining_vertices`, so we can only adjust that one.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5.
- `path` is an empty list.
- `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n.

The condition for the `while` loop to execute is that `remaining_vertices` must not be empty. Since `remaining_vertices` is initialized as a set containing integers from 1 to n, it will not be empty as long as `n` is at least 2 (which it is, according to the problem statement).

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state of `remaining_vertices` because it is already guaranteed to be non-empty given the constraints on `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n**
