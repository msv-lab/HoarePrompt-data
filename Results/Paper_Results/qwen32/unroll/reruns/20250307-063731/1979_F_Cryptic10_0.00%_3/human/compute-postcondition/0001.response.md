Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `remaining_vertices` is now a set containing all integers from 1 to `n`, inclusive. The other variables, `n` and `path`, remain unchanged.
