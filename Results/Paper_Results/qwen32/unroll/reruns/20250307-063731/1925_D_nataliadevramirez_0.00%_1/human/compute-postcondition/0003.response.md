Functionality: **The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of lists `friendships`. The integer `n` represents the number of children, `m` represents the number of pairs of friends, and `k` represents the number of excursions. Each sublist in `friendships` contains three integers `[a_i, b_i, f_i]`, representing the indices of a pair of friends and their friendship value. The function returns the maximum total friendship value that can be achieved by organizing the children into `k` excursions.**
