To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to consider the following:

1. The loop runs `t` times.
2. In each iteration, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` are read from the input.
3. The function `func_1` is called with these values.
4. The result of `func_1` is printed.

Since the loop reads new values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` in each iteration, and `func_1` is called with these new values, the state of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` at the end of the loop will be the values from the last iteration.

The state of `t` remains unchanged as it is the loop counter and does not change within the loop.

Therefore, after all the iterations of the loop, the output state will be the state at the end of the last iteration.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` will be the values from the last iteration of the loop, and `t` remains unchanged.**
