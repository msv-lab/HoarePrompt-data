n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, m is an integer such that 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2), k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 2*10^5, friendships is a list of m tuples where each tuple contains three integers (a_i, b_i, f_i) such that a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9. All pairs (a_i, b_i) in friendships are distinct.
