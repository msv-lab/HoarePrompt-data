### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided program and the original assessment based on the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Problem Analysis

The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs chosen over `k` excursions. The key points are:
1. **Friendship Value Calculation**: For each pair of friends, the friendship value increases by 1 each time they are chosen. The sum of the first `k` natural numbers is \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \).
2. **Expected Value**: The expected contribution of a friend pair with initial friendship value `f` is \( f \times \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \).
3. **Modulo Operation**: All operations should be done modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

#### Program Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Input**: Takes `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list of friendships.
   - **Logic**: Iterates over each friendship, calculates the contribution as \( f \times \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \), and adds it to the result. The result is then taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - **Correctness**: The logic is correct for calculating the expected contribution of each friend pair and summing them up. The modulo operation is applied correctly to the final result.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input**: Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - **Logic**: For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of friendships. It then calls `func_1` to compute the result for that test case and prints the result.
   - **Correctness**: The logic is correct for handling multiple test cases and processing each one.

#### Issues and Corrections

1. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation is applied correctly within `func_1` for each contribution and to the final result. This is appropriate and correct.
2. **Global Variable `MOD`**: The code assumes the existence of a global variable `MOD` which should be defined as \( 10^9 + 7 \). This is necessary for the program to work.

#### Challenges to the Original Assessment

The original assessment states that the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected results. However, there are a few points to consider:
- **Assumption of `MOD`**: The code assumes the existence of `MOD`. If `MOD` is not defined, the program will raise a `NameError`.
- **Handling of Large Numbers**: The program calculates \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \) and multiplies it by `f`. Given the constraints (up to \( k = 2 \times 10^5 \)), \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \) can be as large as \( 2 \times 10^{10} \). Multiplying this by `f` (up to \( 10^9 \)) could lead to very large intermediate results, which should be handled carefully to avoid overflow. However, Python handles large integers natively, so this is not a concern in practice.

Given the above points, the program is correct and should produce the expected results, assuming `MOD` is defined.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**
