### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to verify its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for `k` excursions.
   - The friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time they are chosen and are friends.
   - If a pair is not friends, their friendship value remains 0.

2. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - For each friend pair, the expected number of times it is chosen is \( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \), where \( \binom{n}{2} \) is the total number of possible pairs of children.
   - The sum of the first `k` natural numbers is \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \).
   - The expected contribution of a friend pair with an initial friendship value \( f \) is \( f \times \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \).

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Since the answer needs to be given modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \), all operations should be done under this modulo.

#### Program Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Input**: It takes the number of children `n`, the number of friend pairs `m`, the number of excursions `k`, and a list of friendships.
   - **Logic**: It iterates over each friend pair, calculates the contribution of that pair as \( f \times \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \), and adds it to the result. The result is then taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - **Correctness**: The logic seems correct as it calculates the expected contribution of each friend pair and sums them up. However, the calculation of the contribution should be:
     \[
     \text{contribution} = f \times \left(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\right) \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}
     \]
     where \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \). The current implementation does not include the division by \( \binom{n}{2} \), which is a critical part of the expected value calculation.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input**: It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - **Logic**: For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of friendships. It then calls `func_1` to compute the result for that test case and prints the result.
   - **Correctness**: The logic seems correct as it handles multiple test cases and correctly processes each one.

#### Issues and Corrections

1. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The modulo operation should be applied to the entire result after all contributions are summed, not inside the loop. However, since the problem constraints and the nature of the modulo operation ensure that the intermediate results do not overflow, the current implementation is correct in practice.

2. **Global Variable `MOD`**:
   - The code assumes the existence of a global variable `MOD` which should be defined as \( 10^9 + 7 \). This is not shown in the provided code but is necessary for the program to work.

3. **Missing Division by \( \binom{n}{2} \)**:
   - The current implementation of `func_1` does not include the division by \( \binom{n}{2} \). This is a critical part of the expected value calculation. Without this division, the program does not correctly compute the expected value.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the program is **incorrect** because it does not include the division by \( \binom{n}{2} \) in the expected value calculation. This omission leads to incorrect results.

Final: **False**
