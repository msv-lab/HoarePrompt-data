Reasoning:
The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions, expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) in its simplest form, and then computing \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

The provided code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1`: This function calculates the accumulated sum of the product of each friendship's value and the triangular number of excursions, taken modulo `MOD`. The triangular number of excursions \(k\) is given by the formula \(k \cdot (k + 1) // 2\). This formula is used to compute the sum of the first \(k\) natural numbers, which represents the total contribution of a friendship value \(f\) over \(k\) excursions if the pair is chosen each time.
2. `func_2`: This function reads multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to compute the result for each test case. It reads the number of children, the number of pairs of friends, the number of excursions, and the list of friendships with their respective friendship values. It then prints the result for each test case.

However, there is a misunderstanding in the implementation of `func_1`. The function does not correctly account for the probability of selecting each pair of friends. The expected value should consider that each pair of friends has a probability of \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\) of being chosen in each excursion, where \(\binom{n}{2}\) is the total number of possible pairs of children. The expected contribution of each friendship value \(f\) over \(k\) excursions should be calculated based on this probability.

The current implementation of `func_1` assumes that each friendship value \(f\) contributes \(f \cdot (k \cdot (k + 1) // 2)\) to the result, which is incorrect because it does not consider the probability of selecting each pair.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect as it does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values.

Correctness: **False**
