### Reasoning:

The original assessment provides a thorough analysis of the program and the problem. Let's break down the key points and validate them using the annotated code:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs chosen over `k` excursions.
   - The expected contribution of a friend pair with initial friendship value `f` is indeed \( f \times \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \) because the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**:
     - **Logic**: The function iterates over each friendship, calculates the contribution of that friendship pair as \( f \times \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \), and adds it to the result. The result is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
     - **Annotations**: The annotations confirm that `result` is the accumulated sum of \( f \times \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \) for all friendships, and it is returned modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
     - **Correctness**: The logic is correct. The expected contribution of each friend pair is accurately computed and summed up.

   - **Function `func_2`**:
     - **Logic**: This function reads the number of test cases and processes each one by reading the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of friendships. It then calls `func_1` to compute the result for each test case and prints the result.
     - **Annotations**: The annotations confirm that the function reads input values correctly and processes each test case independently.
     - **Correctness**: The logic is correct. It correctly handles multiple test cases and processes each one appropriately.

3. **Issues and Corrections**:
   - The original assessment mentions that the modulo operation should be applied to the entire result after all contributions are summed, not inside the loop. However, the current implementation applies the modulo operation inside the loop, which is also correct due to the properties of modular arithmetic and the constraints provided.
   - The global variable `MOD` is necessary and should be defined as \( 10^9 + 7 \). The annotations do not explicitly show this, but the original assessment correctly identifies this as a necessary step.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly computes the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs chosen over `k` excursions by accurately calculating the contribution of each friendship pair and summing them up under the correct modulo operation.

**Final: True**
