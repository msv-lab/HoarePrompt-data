You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    result = 0
    for i in range(m):
        (a, b, f) = friendships[i]
        result += f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD
    return result % MOD

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of the number of children, the number of pairs of friends, the number of excursions, and a list of friendships with their respective friendship values. It then calculates and prints the maximum total friendship value that can be achieved by organizing the children into the specified number of excursions for each test case.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for k excursions. The friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time that pair is chosen and they are friends. If a pair is not friends, their friendship value remains 0.

2. **Expected Value Calculation**: For each friend pair, the expected number of times it is chosen is \( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \), where \( \binom{n}{2} \) is the total number of possible pairs of children. The sum of the first k natural numbers is \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \). The expected contribution of a friend pair with initial friendship value \( f \) is \( f \times \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \).

3. **Modulo Operation**: Since the answer needs to be given modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \), all operations should be done under this modulo.

### Program Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Input**: It takes the number of children `n`, the number of friend pairs `m`, the number of excursions `k`, and a list of friendships.
   - **Logic**: It iterates over each friend pair, calculates the contribution of that pair as \( f \times \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \), and adds it to the result. The result is then taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - **Correctness**: The logic seems correct as it calculates the expected contribution of each friend pair and sums them up.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input**: It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - **Logic**: For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of friendships. It then calls `func_1` to compute the result for that test case and prints the result.
   - **Correctness**: The logic seems correct as it handles multiple test cases and correctly processes each one.

### Issues and Corrections

1. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation should be applied to the entire result after all contributions are summed, not inside the loop. However, since the problem constraints and the nature of the modulo operation ensure that the intermediate results do not overflow, the current implementation is correct in practice.

2. **Global Variable `MOD`**: The code assumes the existence of a global variable `MOD` which should be defined as \( 10^9 + 7 \). This is not shown in the provided code but is necessary for the program to work.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected results based on the problem description, assuming the `MOD` variable is defined correctly.
