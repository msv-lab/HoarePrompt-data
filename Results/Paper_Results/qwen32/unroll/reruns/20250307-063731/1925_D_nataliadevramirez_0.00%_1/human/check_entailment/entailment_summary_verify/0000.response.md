### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem in detail and compare it with the provided program and its function summary.

#### Problem Analysis:

The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. The friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time it is chosen. The expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where `p` and `q` are coprime integers, and the final result should be \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

Key points:
- Each pair of children is chosen with equal probability.
- The friendship value of a chosen pair increases by 1 for subsequent excursions.
- We need to calculate the expected sum of friendship values over `k` excursions.

#### Provided Program Analysis:

The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1`: This function calculates the result based on the given `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`.
2. `func_2`: This function reads input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the result.

The core logic in `func_1` is:
```python
def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    result = 0
    for i in range(m):
        (a, b, f) = friendships[i]
        result += f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD
    return result % MOD
```

This logic multiplies the initial friendship value `f` of each pair by the sum of the first `k` natural numbers \(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\) and sums these values across all pairs. This approach assumes that the friendship value increases by 1 for each excursion but does not account for the probability of choosing each pair or the cumulative effect of choosing the same pair multiple times.

#### Correct Approach:

The correct approach should consider:
1. The probability of choosing each pair of children, which is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).
2. The expected contribution of each pair's friendship value to the total sum over `k` excursions, considering the increasing friendship values.

The expected contribution of a pair with initial friendship value `f` can be calculated as follows:
- The expected number of times a pair is chosen in `k` excursions is \(\frac{2k}{n(n-1)}\).
- The expected sum of friendship values for this pair over `k` excursions can be derived using the linearity of expectation.

However, the provided program does not correctly implement this logic. It simply multiplies the initial friendship value by the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is incorrect.

#### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. It fails to account for the probability of choosing each pair and the cumulative effect of increasing friendship values.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
