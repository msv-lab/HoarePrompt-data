### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Let's break down the issues and the correct approach:

#### Issues with the Provided Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Friendship Value Contribution**:
   - The provided program calculates the contribution of each friendship pair by multiplying the initial friendship value `f` by the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, `k * (k + 1) // 2`. This approach does not account for the fact that the friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time it is chosen.
   - The program does not consider the probability of choosing each pair, which is crucial for calculating the expected value.

2. **Ignoring Probability**:
   - The probability of choosing any specific pair of children out of all possible pairs is `1 / C(n, 2)`, where `C(n, 2)` is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n`, which is `n * (n - 1) / 2`.
   - The expected contribution of each pair's friendship value to the total sum over `k` excursions must consider this probability and the increasing friendship values.

#### Correct Approach:
1. **Probability of Choosing a Pair**:
   - The probability of choosing any specific pair `(a, b)` in one excursion is `1 / C(n, 2)`.

2. **Expected Contribution of Each Pair**:
   - For each pair `(a, b)` with an initial friendship value `f`, the expected contribution to the total sum over `k` excursions can be calculated by summing the expected friendship values for each excursion. The friendship value for the `i`-th excursion is `f + (i - 1)` if the pair is chosen in the `i`-th excursion.
   - The expected contribution of a pair `(a, b)` is the sum of the probabilities of choosing the pair in each excursion multiplied by the friendship value at that excursion.

3. **Summing Contributions**:
   - Sum the expected contributions of all pairs to get the final result.

The provided program does not implement this logic, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions, particularly by ignoring the probability of choosing each pair and the increasing friendship values.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
