### Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for excursions, given that the friendship value of a chosen pair of friends increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion. The expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers, and the final result should be \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

Let's break down the provided code:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - This function takes four parameters: `n` (number of children), `m` (number of pairs of friends), `k` (number of excursions), and `friendships` (a list of lists where each sublist contains three integers representing a pair of friends and their friendship value).
    - For each friendship, it calculates the contribution of that friendship to the total sum. The contribution is given by `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`, where `f` is the friendship value and `k * (k + 1) // 2` is the sum of the first `k` natural numbers (triangular number), representing the sum of friendship values if the pair is chosen in each of the `k` excursions.
    - It accumulates these contributions and returns the result modulo `MOD`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
    - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of friendships.
    - It calls `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of `func_1`**:
    - The function correctly calculates the sum of the product of each friendship's value and the triangular number of excursions, taken modulo `MOD`.
    - The formula `k * (k + 1) // 2` is used to compute the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is valid for calculating the expected sum of friendship values over `k` excursions for each pair of friends.

- **Correctness of `func_2`**:
    - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case independently.
    - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and prints the result.

### Conclusion:

The code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It calculates the expected sum of friendship values for each test case and outputs the result in the required format.

**Correctness: True**
