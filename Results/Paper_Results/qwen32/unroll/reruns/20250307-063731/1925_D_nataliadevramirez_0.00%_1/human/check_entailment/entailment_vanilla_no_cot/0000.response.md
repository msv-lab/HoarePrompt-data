Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The issue lies in the calculation of the expected value for each friend pair.

The current implementation calculates the sum of the arithmetic series for each friend pair and multiplies it by the initial friendship value, but it does not account for the fact that the friendship value increases with each subsequent selection of the pair. 

The correct approach involves calculating the expected value for each friend pair based on the probability of being chosen in each of the k excursions and the fact that their friendship value increases by 1 each time they are chosen.

Here's a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    result = 0
    for i in range(m):
        (a, b, f) = friendships[i]
        # Probability of choosing this pair in one excursion is 1 / (n * (n - 1) / 2)
        prob = (2 * (n * (n - 1))) ** -1
        # Expected value for this pair over k excursions
        expected_value = f * (k + 1) * prob
        # Sum of expected values over k excursions
        for j in range(1, k + 1):
            expected_value += j * prob
        result += expected_value
    return int(result) % MOD

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        print(result)
```

However, the above code is still not efficient enough for the given constraints. A more efficient approach involves using the fact that the expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in `k` excursions is `k / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`. The expected sum of the friendship values can be derived from this, considering that the friendship value increases by 1 each time the pair is chosen.

Here's the optimized version:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    result = 0
    total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
    for i in range(m):
        (a, b, f) = friendships[i]
        # Probability of choosing this pair in one excursion is 1 / total_pairs
        prob = k / total_pairs
        # Expected value for this pair over k excursions
        expected_value = f * prob * (k + 1) // 2
        result += expected_value
    return int(result) % MOD

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        print(result)
```

This optimized version should correctly compute the expected value and handle the constraints efficiently.
