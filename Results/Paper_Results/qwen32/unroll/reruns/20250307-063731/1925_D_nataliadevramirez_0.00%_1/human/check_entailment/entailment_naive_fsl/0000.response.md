Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The main issue lies in the way the friendship values are being accumulated and the way the probability is considered.

The program simply multiplies the initial friendship value of each pair by the sum of the first `k` natural numbers and then sums these values across all pairs. This does not account for the fact that the friendship value of a pair increases each time it is chosen, and it does not consider the probability of choosing each pair.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the probability of choosing each pair and how the friendship values evolve over the `k` excursions. The correct approach involves calculating the expected contribution of each pair's friendship value to the total sum over the `k` excursions, taking into account the increasing friendship values.

Here is a corrected version of the logic:

1. Calculate the probability of choosing each pair of children, which is `1 / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`.
2. For each pair, calculate the expected contribution to the total sum of friendship values over `k` excursions. This involves summing the expected friendship values for each excursion, considering the increasing values.
3. Sum the expected contributions of all pairs to get the final result.

Given the complexity of the problem, the provided program does not handle the expected value calculation correctly, leading to incorrect results for many test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
