You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of children, m is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends, k is an integer representing the number of excursions, and friendships is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (a, b, f) representing a pair of friends and their friendship value. It is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5, 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^5, and 1 <= f <= 10^9.

    #State: result is the accumulated sum of f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD for all friendships.
    return result % MOD
    #The program returns the accumulated sum of f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD for all friendships, taken modulo MOD.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the accumulated sum of the product of each friendship's value and the triangular number of excursions, taken modulo `MOD`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of children, m is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends, k is an integer representing the number of excursions, and friendships is a list of lists where each sublist contains three integers [a_i, b_i, f_i] representing the indices of the pair of friends and their friendship value. It is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5, 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^5, a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9.

        print(result)
        
    #State: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` will be the values from the last iteration of the loop, and `t` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of the number of children, the number of pairs of friends, the number of excursions, and a list of friendships with their respective friendship values. It then calculates and prints the maximum total friendship value that can be achieved by organizing the children into the specified number of excursions for each test case.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The main issue lies in the way the friendship values are being accumulated and the way the probability is considered.

The program simply multiplies the initial friendship value of each pair by the sum of the first `k` natural numbers and then sums these values across all pairs. This does not account for the fact that the friendship value of a pair increases each time it is chosen, and it does not consider the probability of choosing each pair.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the probability of choosing each pair and how the friendship values evolve over the `k` excursions. The correct approach involves calculating the expected contribution of each pair's friendship value to the total sum over the `k` excursions, taking into account the increasing friendship values.

Here is a corrected version of the logic:

1. Calculate the probability of choosing each pair of children, which is `1 / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`.
2. For each pair, calculate the expected contribution to the total sum of friendship values over `k` excursions. This involves summing the expected friendship values for each excursion, considering the increasing values.
3. Sum the expected contributions of all pairs to get the final result.

Given the complexity of the problem, the provided program does not handle the expected value calculation correctly, leading to incorrect results for many test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
