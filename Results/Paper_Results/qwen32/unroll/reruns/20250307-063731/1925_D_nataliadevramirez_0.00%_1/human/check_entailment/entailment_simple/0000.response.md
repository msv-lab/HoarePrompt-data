Reasoning:

The provided program is structured to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - It iterates through each friendship, calculates the contribution of that friendship to the total sum, and accumulates it.
   - The formula `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` is used to calculate the contribution of each friendship. This formula is correct because it computes the sum of an arithmetic series (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k) and multiplies it by the initial friendship value `f`.
   - The result is then taken modulo `MOD` to ensure it fits within the required constraints.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles the input and output for multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values `n`, `m`, and `k`, and then reads the list of friendships.
   - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and prints the result.

3. **Overall Logic**:
   - The logic correctly calculates the expected sum of friendship values for each test case.
   - The program handles multiple test cases as required.
   - The result is correctly computed modulo `10^9 + 7`.

However, there is a critical issue with the formula used in `func_1`. The formula `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` assumes that each friendship pair is always chosen `k` times, which is not correct. Instead, the probability of choosing a specific pair is `1 / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`, and the expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in `k` excursions is `k / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`. Therefore, the correct formula should account for this probability.

The correct contribution of each friendship to the total sum should be `f * (k / (n * (n - 1) / 2)) * (k / (n * (n - 1) / 2) + 1) / 2`, which simplifies to `f * k * (k + 1) / (n * (n - 1))`.

Since the provided program does not account for the probability of choosing each pair, it will not produce the correct result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
