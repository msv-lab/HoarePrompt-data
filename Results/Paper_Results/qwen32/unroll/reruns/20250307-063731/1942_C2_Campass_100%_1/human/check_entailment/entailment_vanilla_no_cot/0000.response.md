Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Logic for Counting Triangles**: The program's logic for counting the maximum number of triangles is flawed. It attempts to maximize the number of triangles by sorting the gaps between chosen vertices and then trying to fill them with additional vertices. However, the approach does not correctly account for the constraints and the geometry of the problem.

2. **Handling of y**: The program does not correctly handle the constraint on `y`, the maximum number of additional vertices that can be chosen. The logic for using `y` to fill gaps and form triangles is incorrect and does not guarantee the maximum number of triangles.

3. **Sorting and Filling Gaps**: The sorting and filling gaps approach does not consider the optimal way to form triangles. It should consider the gaps between chosen vertices and the potential to form triangles by adding vertices in a way that maximizes the number of triangles without creating intersecting diagonals.

4. **Final Calculation**: The final calculation of the number of triangles (`cons = x + sx - 2`) is incorrect. The formula does not properly account for the number of triangles formed by the chosen vertices and the additional vertices.

To solve this problem correctly, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm that considers the optimal way to form triangles given the constraints on `x` and `y`.

Given these issues, the program is not correct.
