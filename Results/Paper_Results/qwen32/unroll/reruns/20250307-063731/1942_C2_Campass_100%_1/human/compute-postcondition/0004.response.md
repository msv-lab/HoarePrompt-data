Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers: `n`, `x`, and `y`. The integer `n` represents the total number of vertices, `x` represents the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and `y` represents a specific value related to the vertices. Additionally, it accepts a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The function processes these inputs for each test case and returns a result based on the given constraints.**
