You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the provided program correctly solves the problem, we need to analyze the logic and ensure that it adheres to the problem requirements and constraints.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing up to `y` additional vertices from a regular polygon with `n` sides. Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices.

### Key Points:
1. **Vertices and Diagonals**: We need to form triangles by drawing non-intersecting diagonals between chosen vertices.
2. **Maximize Triangles**: The goal is to maximize the number of triangles formed.
3. **Constraints**: We can choose up to `y` additional vertices, and the vertices chosen by Bessie are given.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of `x` vertices chosen by Bessie.
2. **Sorting and Wrapping**: The vertices are sorted, and the list is wrapped by appending `n + l[0]` to handle the circular nature of the polygon.
3. **Gap Calculation**: The program calculates the gaps between consecutive vertices.
4. **Sorting Gaps**: The gaps are sorted in a specific order to maximize the number of triangles.
5. **Triangle Formation**: The program attempts to form triangles by using the gaps and the available additional vertices `y`.

### Detailed Steps:
1. **Gap Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the gaps between consecutive vertices. For example, if the vertices are `[1, 3, 5]` in a polygon with `n=8`, the gaps would be `[2, 2, 3]` (considering the wrap-around to the start).
2. **Sorting Gaps**:
   - The gaps are sorted based on a specific key function `(1 - x & 1, x)`, which prioritizes even gaps and then smaller gaps.
3. **Triangle Formation**:
   - For each gap, the program calculates the number of triangles that can be formed (`i // 2`).
   - It then checks if the available additional vertices `y` are sufficient to form these triangles. If not, it forms as many triangles as possible with the available vertices and breaks out of the loop.
   - The total number of triangles is calculated and printed.

### Issues:
1. **Logic for Triangle Formation**:
   - The logic for forming triangles seems flawed. The program calculates the number of triangles based on gaps but does not correctly account for the actual formation of triangles.
   - The key function for sorting gaps might not be optimal for maximizing triangles.
2. **Handling Wrap-around Correctly**:
   - The wrap-around is handled by appending `n + l[0]`, but the logic for calculating gaps and forming triangles might not correctly handle this.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake. The sorting key and the triangle formation logic need to be re-evaluated.
