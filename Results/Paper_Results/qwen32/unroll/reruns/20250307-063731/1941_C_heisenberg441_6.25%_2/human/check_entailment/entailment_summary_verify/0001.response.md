### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program and the function summaries in detail to determine if the original assessment is accurate or inaccurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the minimum number of deletions required to make a string beautiful by removing substrings "map" and "pie". The function `func_1` is supposed to achieve this by counting the deletions needed to remove these substrings.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program includes a function `func_1` that:
1. Checks if the string is exactly "mapie" and returns 1, which is incorrect because "mapie" should be treated as containing both "map" and "pie", requiring 2 deletions.
2. Iteratively removes the middle character of the first occurrence of "map" and "pie" in the string, incrementing a counter `ans` each time.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Special Case Handling**:
   - The special case `if s == 'mapie': return 1` is incorrect. As mentioned, "mapie" contains both "map" and "pie", so it should return 2 deletions.

2. **Inefficient and Incorrect Deletion Logic**:
   - The approach of removing the middle character of "map" and "pie" does not guarantee the minimum number of deletions. For example, in the string "mappppie", the program will incorrectly remove the middle 'p' of "map" and "pie", leading to incorrect results.
   - The function does not handle overlapping substrings correctly. For instance, in the string "mapie", the program will incorrectly remove the 'a' in "map" and then the 'p' in "pie", leading to incorrect results.

3. **Overlapping Substrings**:
   - The function does not account for overlapping substrings. For example, in the string "mapie", the program should remove 'm' from "map" and 'p' from "pie" to achieve the minimum deletions.

#### Correctness of the Program:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. The logic for handling deletions is flawed, and the special case for "mapie" is incorrect.

#### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the program. The program fails to handle overlapping substrings correctly and incorrectly handles the special case of "mapie".

### Final: **False**
