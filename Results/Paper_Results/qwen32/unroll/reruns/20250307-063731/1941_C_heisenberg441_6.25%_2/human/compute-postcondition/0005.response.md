The given code snippet contains a while loop that repeatedly removes the substring 'map' from the string `s` and increments the counter `ans` by 1 each time it finds and removes 'map'. The loop continues until there are no more occurrences of 'map' in the string `s`.

Let's break down the process:

1. The loop checks if the substring 'map' is present in `s` using `s.find('map')`. If `s.find('map')` returns `-1`, it means 'map' is not found, and the loop terminates.
2. If 'map' is found, the code removes 'map' by slicing the string `s` into two parts: the part before 'map' (`s[:s.find('map')]`) and the part after 'map' (`s[s.find('map') + 3:]`), effectively skipping the 'map' substring.
3. The counter `ans` is incremented by 1 for each removal of 'map'.
4. The loop repeats the process until 'map' is no longer found in `s`.

After the loop finishes executing, the final state of the variables will be:
- `s`: The string `s` with all occurrences of 'map' removed.
- `ans`: The number of times 'map' was found and removed from `s`.

Output State: **`s` with all 'map' substrings removed, `ans` is the count of removed 'map' substrings.**

In natural language: The final state is that all occurrences of the substring 'map' have been removed from the string `s`, and `ans` holds the count of how many times 'map' was removed.
