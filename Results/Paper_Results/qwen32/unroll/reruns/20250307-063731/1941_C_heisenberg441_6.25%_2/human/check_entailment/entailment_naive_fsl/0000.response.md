Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program is intended to remove the minimum number of characters from a string to make it beautiful by eliminating the substrings "map" and "pie". However, the current implementation has a few issues:

1. **Handling Overlapping Substrings**: The current implementation does not correctly handle overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie". For example, consider the string "mapiepie". The program will first remove "map" and then "pie", but it should recognize that removing the "p" in the middle would make the string beautiful with just one removal (resulting in "maie" or "mapi").

2. **Incorrect Special Case Handling**: The special case `if s == 'mapie': return 1` is incorrect and unnecessary. The program should handle all cases uniformly without such special conditions.

3. **Inefficient Substring Removal**: The program uses `s.find('map')` and `s.find('pie')` in a loop to find and remove substrings, which can be inefficient and does not guarantee the minimum removals due to the overlapping issue mentioned above.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm that considers all possible removals and ensures the minimum number of deletions.

Here's a potential counterexample where the current program fails:

Input:
```
1
7
mapiepie
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Actual Output (from the given program):
```
2
```

This shows that the program does not handle overlapping substrings correctly and thus does not always provide the minimum number of deletions required.
