You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Example

Input

    9
    
    mmapnapie

    8

    18
    
    mapmapmapmapmapmap
    
    1
    
    p
    
    11
    
    pppiepieeee

Output

    2
    0
    2
    6
    0
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    if s == 'mapie':
        return 1
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
        ans += 1
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
        ans += 1
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` of lowercase Latin letters. It returns 1 if the string is exactly 'mapie'. Otherwise, it returns the count of 'map' and 'pie' substrings that are removed from the string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program is intended to remove the minimum number of characters from a string to make it beautiful by eliminating the substrings "map" and "pie". However, the current implementation has a few issues:

1. **Handling Overlapping Substrings**: The current implementation does not correctly handle overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie". For example, consider the string "mapiepie". The program will first remove "map" and then "pie", but it should recognize that removing the "p" in the middle would make the string beautiful with just one removal (resulting in "maie" or "mapi").

2. **Incorrect Special Case Handling**: The special case `if s == 'mapie': return 1` is incorrect and unnecessary. The program should handle all cases uniformly without such special conditions.

3. **Inefficient Substring Removal**: The program uses `s.find('map')` and `s.find('pie')` in a loop to find and remove substrings, which can be inefficient and does not guarantee the minimum removals due to the overlapping issue mentioned above.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm that considers all possible removals and ensures the minimum number of deletions.

Here's a potential counterexample where the current program fails:

Input:
```
1
7
mapiepie
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Actual Output (from the given program):
```
2
```

This shows that the program does not handle overlapping substrings correctly and thus does not always provide the minimum number of deletions required.
