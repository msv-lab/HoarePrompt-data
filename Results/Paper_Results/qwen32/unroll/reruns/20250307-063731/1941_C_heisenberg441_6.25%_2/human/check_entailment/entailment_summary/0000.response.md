Reasoning:
The given program is intended to determine the minimum number of characters that need to be removed from a string to make it beautiful by eliminating the substrings "map" and "pie". However, there are some issues with the implementation:

1. The program checks if the string is exactly 'mapie' and returns 1, which is incorrect. The problem requires us to find the minimum number of deletions to make the string beautiful, not to return a specific value if the string is 'mapie'. This check is unnecessary and incorrect.

2. The program removes 'map' and 'pie' substrings by finding their first occurrence and deleting two characters starting from the found index. This approach does not guarantee that the minimum number of deletions is found. For example, consider the string "pmpie". The program would first remove "mp" from "mapie" (incorrectly treating "mp" as part of "map"), resulting in "pie", and then remove "pie", leading to an incorrect result.

3. The program does not handle overlapping substrings correctly. For example, in the string "mpiepie", the program might remove the first "pie" and then incorrectly count the second "pie" as a separate substring, leading to an incorrect result.

To correctly solve the problem, we need a dynamic programming approach or a more sophisticated greedy algorithm that correctly handles overlapping substrings and minimizes the number of deletions.

Given the above issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
