Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function is designed to return the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string `s` beautiful.
   - The function first checks if the string is exactly "mapie". If so, it returns 1. However, this special case is not necessary and is incorrect because "mapie" should be treated as containing both "map" and "pie", requiring 2 deletions.
   - The function then enters a loop to remove occurrences of "map" by finding the first occurrence of "map" and removing the middle character, incrementing the counter `ans` each time.
   - Similarly, it enters another loop to remove occurrences of "pie" by finding the first occurrence of "pie" and removing the middle character, incrementing the counter `ans` each time.
   - Finally, it returns the counter `ans` which represents the number of characters removed.

3. **Issues in the Program**:
   - The special case `if s == 'mapie': return 1` is incorrect because "mapie" contains both "map" and "pie", and thus requires 2 deletions.
   - The approach of removing the middle character of "map" and "pie" does not guarantee the minimum number of deletions. For example, in the string "mappppie", the program will remove the middle 'p' of "map" first, resulting in "mpppie", and then remove the middle 'p' of "pie", resulting in "mppie" again, which is incorrect. The optimal solution would be to remove the 'm' in "map" and the 'p' in "pie", resulting in "ppie", and then remove the middle 'p' of "pie", resulting in "pie", and then remove the 'p' and 'i' of "pie", resulting in "", which requires 6 deletions.
   - The program does not handle overlapping substrings correctly. For example, in the string "mapie", the program will remove the 'a' in "map" first, resulting in "mpie", and then remove the 'p' in "pie", resulting in "mie", which is incorrect. The optimal solution would be to remove the 'm' in "map" and the 'p' in "pie", resulting in "ie", which requires 2 deletions.

4. **Correctness**:
   - Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **False**
