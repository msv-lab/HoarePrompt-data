To determine the output state, we need to carefully analyze the given loop and how it modifies the string `s` and the integer `ans`.

The initial state is:
- `s` with all 'map' substrings removed.
- `ans` is the count of removed 'map' substrings.

The loop provided is:
```python
while s.find('pie') != -1:
    s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
    ans += 1
```
This loop will continue to execute as long as the substring 'pie' is found in `s`. In each iteration, it removes the substring 'pie' from `s` and increments `ans` by 1.

Let's break down the process:
1. **Initial Check**: The loop checks if 'pie' exists in `s`.
2. **Modification**: If 'pie' is found, it removes 'pie' from `s` by concatenating the part before 'pie' and the part after 'pie'.
3. **Increment**: It then increments `ans` by 1.
4. **Repeat**: The loop repeats the process until 'pie' is no longer found in `s`.

Since the initial state does not specify any 'pie' substrings in `s`, the loop condition `s.find('pie') != -1` will be false from the start. Therefore, the loop will not execute at all.

Thus, the output state will be the same as the initial state:
- `s` remains unchanged (with all 'map' substrings already removed).
- `ans` remains unchanged (the count of removed 'map' substrings).

Output State: **s with all 'map' substrings removed, ans is the count of removed 'map' substrings.**
