To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the state such that the condition `s.find('pie') != -1` evaluates to `True`. This means that the string `s` must contain the substring `'pie'`.

Given the state right before the `while` loop is `s` with all `'map'` substrings removed and `ans` is the count of removed `'map'` substrings, we need to ensure that `s` contains the substring `'pie'`.

Since the loop condition only involves the variable `s`, we only need to adjust `s` to include the substring `'pie'`.

State: **`s` must contain the substring `'pie'`, `ans` is the count of removed `'map'` substrings**

This ensures that the condition `s.find('pie') != -1` is satisfied, allowing the loop to execute.
