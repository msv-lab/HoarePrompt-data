Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Infinite Loop Potential**: The function `func_1` does not handle the case where the removal of 'map' or 'pie' creates a new 'map' or 'pie' substring. For example, if the string is "mapmap", removing the first 'map' results in "map", which will result in an infinite loop since 'map' is still present.

2. **Incorrect Special Case Handling**: The function `func_1` contains a special case check for the string "mapie" which returns 1, but this is not a general solution and is incorrect for other cases.

3. **Inefficient Removal**: The function uses a while loop to repeatedly find and remove 'map' and 'pie' substrings, which is not efficient and can lead to incorrect results due to the reasons mentioned above.

To fix these issues, a more robust approach would be to use dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to count the minimum removals required to make the string beautiful. The current implementation is not guaranteed to produce the correct minimum number of deletions for all possible input cases.
