Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of integers where each integer is between 1 and 500, and an integer `n` which is one more than the length of `arr`. The function returns a list `ans` where each element `ans[i]` is calculated as `10 - sum(arr[i:])` for `i` from `0` to `len(arr)-1`, and `ans[len(arr)]` is `10`.**
