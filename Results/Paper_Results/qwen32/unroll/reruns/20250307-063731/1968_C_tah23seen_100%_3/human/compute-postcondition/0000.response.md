The code snippet initializes a list `ans` with `n` elements, all set to `10 ** 9`. The value of `n` is already defined as `len(arr) + 1`, and the properties of `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 499 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 0 <= i < len(arr); `n` is an integer such that n = len(arr) + 1 and 2 <= n <= 500; `ans` is a list of integers with `n` elements, each element being `10 ** 9`.**
