Output State: **The program returns the list `ans` where each element `ans[i]` is calculated as `10 - sum(arr[i:])` for `i` from `0` to `len(arr)-1`, and `ans[len(arr)]` is `10`.**

In simpler terms, the program returns a list `ans` where each element at index `i` is `10` minus the sum of the elements in `arr` starting from index `i` to the end of `arr`. The last element of `ans` is always `10`.
