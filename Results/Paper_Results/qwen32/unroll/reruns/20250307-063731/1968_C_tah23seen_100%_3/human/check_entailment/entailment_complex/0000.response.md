Reasoning:

The provided annotated program is intended to solve the given problem by generating an array `a` such that `a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`. However, the logic in `func_1` does not correctly implement this requirement.

The function `func_1` initializes `ans` with `10^9` and then iteratively sets each element of `ans` from the end to the start based on the formula `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`. This approach does not guarantee that the resulting `ans` array will satisfy the modulo condition specified in the problem statement.

For example, consider the first test case from the problem statement:
```
4
2 4 1
```
The function `func_1` will produce an array `ans` such that:
```
ans[3] = 10^9
ans[2] = ans[3] - 1 = 10^9 - 1
ans[1] = ans[2] - 4 = 10^9 - 5
ans[0] = ans[1] - 2 = 10^9 - 7
```
This array does not satisfy the required conditions:
- `ans[1] mod ans[0]` is not equal to `2`
- `ans[2] mod ans[1]` is not equal to `4`
- `ans[3] mod ans[2]` is not equal to `1`

A correct implementation would need to ensure that each `ans[i]` is chosen such that `ans[i] mod ans[i-1] = arr[i-1]` while also ensuring that all `ans[i]` are within the range `[1, 10^9]`.

Correctness: **False**
