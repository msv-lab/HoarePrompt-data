The variable `i` is assigned the value `n - 2`. Given that `n` is `len(arr) + 1`, `i` will be `len(arr) - 1`. The other variables (`arr`, `n`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 499 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 0 <= i < len(arr); `n` is an integer such that n = len(arr) + 1 and 2 <= n <= 500; `ans` is a list of integers with `n` elements, each element being `10`; `i` is `len(arr) - 1`**.
