#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 499 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 0 <= i < len(arr). n is an integer such that n = len(arr) + 1 and 2 <= n <= 500.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        i -= 1
        
    #State: ans[0] = 10 - sum(arr), ans[1] = 10 - sum(arr[1:]), ..., ans[len(arr)-1] = 10 - arr[len(arr)-1], ans[len(arr)] = 10
    return ans
    #The program returns the list `ans` where each element `ans[i]` is calculated as `10 - sum(arr[i:])` for `i` from `0` to `len(arr)-1`, and `ans[len(arr)]` is `10`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n` that is one more than the length of `arr`. It returns a list `ans` where each element `ans[i]` is calculated as `10 - sum(arr[i:])` for `i` from `0` to `len(arr)-1`, and `ans[len(arr)]` is `10`.
