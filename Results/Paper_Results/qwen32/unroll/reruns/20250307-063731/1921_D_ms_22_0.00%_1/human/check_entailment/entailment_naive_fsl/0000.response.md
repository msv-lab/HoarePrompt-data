Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to be correctly implementing the logic to maximize the total difference \( D \) between Petya's array and Vasya's array. Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Sorting the Array \( b \)**: The program sorts the array \( b \) to easily access the smallest and largest elements.
2. **Max-Heap for Differences**: It uses a max-heap (priority queue) to keep track of the maximum possible differences for each element in \( a \) by comparing it with the smallest and largest elements in \( b \).
3. **Two Pointers \( tp1 \) and \( tp2 \)**: These pointers track the smallest and largest elements in \( b \) that haven't been used yet. This ensures that the program always uses the most optimal elements to maximize the difference.
4. **Heap Operations**: The program pushes the maximum possible differences for each element in \( a \) into the heap. It then pops these differences from the heap, adjusts the pointers \( tp1 \) and \( tp2 \) as necessary, and accumulates the total difference \( D \).

The program handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem description correctly. It efficiently computes the maximum difference by leveraging the sorted array and a max-heap, ensuring that the solution is optimal for the given problem.

Since the program follows the problem description for every potential case and correctly handles the edge cases and examples provided, it can be considered correct.
