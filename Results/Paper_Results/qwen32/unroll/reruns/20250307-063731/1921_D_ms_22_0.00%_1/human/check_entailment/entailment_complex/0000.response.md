### Reasoning:
The task is to maximize the total difference \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \) where \( c_i \) are chosen from the list \( b_i \) such that \( c_i \) is arranged to maximize the difference from \( a_i \).

The provided program uses a max-heap to keep track of the maximum possible difference that can be achieved for each element of \( a \) initially by comparing it with the smallest and largest elements of \( b \). It then iteratively selects the maximum difference and adjusts the pointers (`tp1` and `tp2`) to ensure that the selected elements from \( b \) are not reused.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:
1. **Sorting \( b \)**: The program sorts the list \( b \) to easily access the smallest and largest elements.
2. **Heap Initialization**: For each element in \( a \), the program calculates the absolute difference with the smallest and largest elements of \( b \) and pushes the larger difference (along with the element from \( a \) and the index of the element in \( b \) used for the difference) into a max-heap.
3. **Heap Processing**: The program pops the largest difference from the heap and checks if the index of the element from \( b \) used for the difference is still valid (i.e., not yet used up by `tp1` or `tp2`). If valid, it adds the difference to the answer. If not, it recalculates the difference using the next smallest or largest element from \( b \) and adjusts the pointers accordingly.
4. **Output**: After processing all elements, the program prints the total difference for each test case.

The program ensures that the maximum possible difference is always considered and that no element from \( b \) is reused unnecessarily, which aligns with the goal of maximizing the total difference.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the total difference \( D \) by using a max-heap to keep track of the largest possible differences and adjusting the pointers to ensure no reuse of elements from \( b \). The provided example outputs match the expected results, indicating that the program is working as intended.

**Correctness: True**
