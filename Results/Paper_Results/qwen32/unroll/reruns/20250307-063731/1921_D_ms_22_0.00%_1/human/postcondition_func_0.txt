The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `m`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. It calculates and prints a result for each test case, which is the minimum possible sum of absolute differences between elements of `a` and selected elements of `b` after performing a series of operations.
