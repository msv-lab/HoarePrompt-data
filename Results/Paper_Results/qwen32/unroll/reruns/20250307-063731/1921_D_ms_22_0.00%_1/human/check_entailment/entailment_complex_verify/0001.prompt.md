You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

    #State: The value of `ans` for each test case is printed in sequence, and `t` is set to 0 after all test cases are processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `m`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. It calculates and prints a result for each test case, which is the minimum possible sum of absolute differences between elements of `a` and selected elements of `b` after performing a series of operations.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
The goal is to maximize the total difference \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \), where \( c_i \) is a permutation of \( n \) integers chosen from the array \( b \).

### Strategy:
To maximize the difference, for each element in array \( a \), we should choose the corresponding element in \( c \) to be either the smallest or the largest possible value from \( b \) that hasn't been used yet. This is because the absolute difference \( |a_i - c_i| \) will be maximized when \( c_i \) is as far from \( a_i \) as possible.

### Program Explanation:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \) and \( m \), followed by the arrays \( a \) and \( b \).
2. **Sorting**: The array \( b \) is sorted.
3. **Heap Initialization**: A max heap is used to keep track of the maximum possible differences for each element in \( a \). The heap stores tuples of the form \((- \text{difference}, a_i, \text{index in b})\).
4. **Heap Population**: For each element \( i \) in \( a \), the program calculates the potential differences with the smallest and largest elements in \( b \) and pushes these into the heap.
5. **Maximizing Differences**: The program then pops elements from the heap, ensuring that the indices from \( b \) are used efficiently. If an index from \( b \) has already been used, it recalculates the best possible difference using the remaining elements in \( b \).
6. **Result Calculation**: The program accumulates the maximum differences and prints the result for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Heap Usage**: The heap is used to efficiently manage and select the maximum possible differences for each element in \( a \).
- **Index Management**: The program ensures that each index from \( b \) is used at most once, and recalculates differences if necessary.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles cases where \( n = m \) and \( n < m \) correctly. It also handles cases where all elements in \( b \) are the same, resulting in a difference of 0.

The program appears to correctly implement the strategy described above and handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
