The only variable in the loop head is `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The condition for the loop to execute is `t > 0`.

Given that `t` is an input integer where `1 <= t <= 100`, the condition `t > 0` is already satisfied for all valid inputs of `t`. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure that the loop can execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= `t` <= 100**
