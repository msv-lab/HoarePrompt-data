Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
The goal is to maximize the total difference \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \), where \( c_i \) is a permutation of \( n \) integers chosen from the array \( b \).

### Strategy:
To maximize the difference, for each element in array \( a \), we should choose the corresponding element in \( c \) to be either the smallest or the largest possible value from \( b \) that hasn't been used yet. This is because the absolute difference \( |a_i - c_i| \) will be maximized when \( c_i \) is as far from \( a_i \) as possible.

### Program Explanation:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \) and \( m \), followed by the arrays \( a \) and \( b \).
2. **Sorting**: The array \( b \) is sorted.
3. **Heap Initialization**: A max heap is used to keep track of the maximum possible differences for each element in \( a \). The heap stores tuples of the form \((- \text{difference}, a_i, \text{index in b})\).
4. **Heap Population**: For each element \( i \) in \( a \), the program calculates the potential differences with the smallest and largest elements in \( b \) and pushes these into the heap.
5. **Maximizing Differences**: The program then pops elements from the heap, ensuring that the indices from \( b \) are used efficiently. If an index from \( b \) has already been used, it recalculates the best possible difference using the remaining elements in \( b \).
6. **Result Calculation**: The program accumulates the maximum differences and prints the result for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Heap Usage**: The heap is used to efficiently manage and select the maximum possible differences for each element in \( a \).
- **Index Management**: The program ensures that each index from \( b \) is used at most once, and recalculates differences if necessary.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles cases where \( n = m \) and \( n < m \) correctly. It also handles cases where all elements in \( b \) are the same, resulting in a difference of 0.

The program appears to correctly implement the strategy described above and handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
