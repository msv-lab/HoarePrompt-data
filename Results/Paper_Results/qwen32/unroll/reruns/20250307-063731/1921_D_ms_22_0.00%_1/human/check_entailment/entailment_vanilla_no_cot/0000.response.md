Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by using a max heap to keep track of the maximum possible difference for each element in array `a` with elements from array `b`. However, the logic used to update the pointers `tp1` and `tp2` and to calculate the maximum difference is flawed, and it does not guarantee that the maximum possible difference `D` is obtained.

To maximize the total difference `D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i|`, Vasya should pair each element `a_i` with the element in `b` that will maximize the absolute difference. The optimal strategy is to sort both arrays and then pair the smallest `a_i` with the largest `b_i` or the smallest `b_i` depending on which gives the larger difference, and continue this process.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        b.sort()
        
        ans = 0
        i, j = 0, m - 1
        for x in a:
            if abs(x - b[i]) > abs(x - b[j]):
                ans += abs(x - b[i])
                i += 1
            else:
                ans += abs(x - b[j])
                j -= 1
        print(ans)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func()
```

This corrected version sorts both arrays and then iterates through each element in `a`, pairing it with the element in `b` that gives the maximum possible difference, updating the pointers `i` and `j` accordingly. This ensures that the maximum total difference `D` is obtained.
