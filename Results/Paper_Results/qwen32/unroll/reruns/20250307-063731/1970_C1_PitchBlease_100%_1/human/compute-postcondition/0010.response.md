Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of nodes in a tree (where 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5); `edges`, a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents an edge in the tree with 1 <= u, v <= n; and `start`, an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed (where 1 <= start <= n). The function returns 'Ron' in Case_1 and 'Hermione' in Case_2.**
