Output State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node in the tree, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, the tree is an adjacency list where each node points to its neighbors, `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`, `visited` is a set containing the single element `start`.**

In simple terms, the `visited` set now includes the `start` node, while all other variables remain unchanged.
