Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

# Annotated Program:
from collections import deque, defaultdict

(n, t) = map(int, input().split())
edges = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n - 1)]
starts = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(func_1(n, edges, start))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, edges is a list of tuples of integers where each tuple (u, v) represents an edge in the tree with 1 <= u, v <= n, and start is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially put such that 1 <= start <= n.

    #State: `tree` is a defaultdict of lists where each key `u` (from 1 to n) maps to a list of integers representing all nodes directly connected to `u` by an edge in the tree. The values of `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged.

        #The program returns 'Ron'
    else :

        #The program returns 'Hermione'

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is an integer representing the starting node in the tree, and target is an integer representing the target node in the tree. The tree is an adjacency list where each node points to its neighbors, and both start and target are valid nodes within this tree.

    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: the shortest distance from `start` to `target` if reachable, otherwise `None`. The `queue` will be empty, and the `visited` set will contain all nodes reachable from `start`.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
