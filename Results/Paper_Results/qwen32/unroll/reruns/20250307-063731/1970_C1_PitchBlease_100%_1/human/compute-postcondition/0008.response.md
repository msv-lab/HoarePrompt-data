Postcondition: **`tree` is a defaultdict of lists where each key `u` (from 1 to `n`) maps to a list of integers representing all nodes directly connected to `u` by an edge in the tree; `leaves` is a list of nodes that have exactly one connection in the tree; `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged; `dist1` is the shortest distance from `start` to `leaves[0]`; `dist2` is the shortest distance from `start` to `leaves[1]`; both `dist1` and `dist2` are even numbers.**
