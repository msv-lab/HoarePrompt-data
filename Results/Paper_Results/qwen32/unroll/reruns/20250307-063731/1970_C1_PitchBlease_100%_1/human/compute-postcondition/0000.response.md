Output State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node in the tree, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, the tree is an adjacency list where each node points to its neighbors, `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`.**

In natural language: The `start` and `target` variables remain unchanged. The `tree` structure remains as an adjacency list. A new variable `queue` is created as a deque containing a single tuple with the starting node and a distance of 0.
