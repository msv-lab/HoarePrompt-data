The `while` loop in the provided code snippet will execute as long as the `queue` is not empty. The loop head only involves the `queue` variable. Given that the `queue` is initialized with a single tuple `(start, 0)`, it is already non-empty. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to ensure that the loop can execute its first iteration.

State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node in the tree, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, the tree is an adjacency list where each node points to its neighbors, `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`, `visited` is a set containing the single element `start`.**
