To understand the output state, let's break down the given code. The code is implementing a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest distance from a `start` node to a `target` node in an undirected graph represented as an adjacency list.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `start` is the node from which the search begins.
   - `target` is the node we are trying to reach.
   - `tree` is an adjacency list representing the graph.
   - `queue` is a deque initialized with a single tuple `(start, 0)`, indicating that the distance from `start` to itself is `0`.
   - `visited` is a set initialized with the `start` node to keep track of visited nodes.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop continues until the `queue` is empty.
   - In each iteration, the node at the front of the `queue` is dequeued, and its distance from the `start` node is recorded.
   - If the dequeued node is the `target`, the function returns the distance, indicating the shortest path found.
   - Otherwise, the code iterates over all the neighbors of the current node.
   - If a neighbor has not been visited, it is added to the `visited` set, and a tuple containing the neighbor and the distance to it (current distance + 1) is appended to the `queue`.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when the `queue` is empty, which means all reachable nodes have been visited.
   - If the `target` node is found during the BFS, the function returns the shortest distance.
   - If the `target` node is not found, the function implicitly returns `None` (or could be modified to return a specific value indicating the target is unreachable).

Given the loop's behavior, the output state depends on whether the `target` node is reachable from the `start` node:

- **If the `target` node is reachable**:
  - The loop will return the shortest distance from `start` to `target`.
  - The `queue` will be empty.
  - The `visited` set will contain all nodes that were reachable from `start`.

- **If the `target` node is not reachable**:
  - The loop will exhaust the `queue` without finding the `target`.
  - The function will implicitly return `None`.
  - The `queue` will be empty.
  - The `visited` set will contain all nodes that were reachable from `start`.

Since the problem does not specify whether the `target` is reachable, we will consider the general case where the `target` is reachable, and the function returns the shortest distance.

Output State: **the shortest distance from `start` to `target` if reachable, otherwise `None`. The `queue` will be empty, and the `visited` set will contain all nodes reachable from `start`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the function returns the shortest distance from the starting node to the target node if it is reachable. The queue will be empty, and the visited set will contain all the nodes that were reachable from the starting node during the BFS traversal.
