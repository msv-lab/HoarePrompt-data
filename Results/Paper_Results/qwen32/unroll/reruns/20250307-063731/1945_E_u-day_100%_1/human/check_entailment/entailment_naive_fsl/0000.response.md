Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not always correctly handle the problem description. The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before performing a binary search so that after the algorithm is executed, `p_l` is equal to `x`. The program is supposed to perform at most 2 swaps to achieve this.

Let's analyze the provided code:

1. **Finding the position of `x`**:
   ```python
   pos = -1
   for i in range(n):
       if arr[i] == k:
           pos = i
   ```
   This correctly finds the position of `x` in the array.

2. **Binary Search Simulation**:
   ```python
   (low, high) = (0, n)
   st = set()
   while low + 1 < high:
       mid = (low + high) // 2
       st.add(mid)
       if arr[mid] > k:
           high = mid
       else:
           low = mid
   ```
   This simulates the binary search process and keeps track of the `mid` values used in the search.

3. **Checking if `x` is found**:
   ```python
   if arr[low] == k:
       print(0)
   else:
       print(1)
       print(low + 1, pos + 1)
   ```
   If `x` is found at `arr[low]`, then no swaps are needed. Otherwise, the program suggests swapping the element at `low` with the element at `pos`.

### Potential Issue:
The program does not always perform the correct swaps to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search. Specifically, the program only performs one swap if `x` is not found at `arr[low]`. However, the problem guarantees that two swaps are always sufficient, and the program does not handle the case where one swap is not enough.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```
The correct output should be:
```
2
4 5
2 4
```
Explanation:
- Initially, the array is `[4, 3, 1, 5, 2, 6]`.
- The binary search steps would be:
  - `mid = (0 + 6) // 2 = 3`, `arr[3] = 5 > 3`, so `high = 3`.
  - `mid = (0 + 3) // 2 = 1`, `arr[1] = 3 == 3`, so `low = 1`.
- Since `x` is found at `arr[low]`, no swaps are needed, but the program does not correctly handle the scenario where `x` is not found at `arr[low]` and more than one swap is required.

The provided program does not account for all possible scenarios where two swaps are necessary to correctly position `x` for the binary search to find it at `p_l`.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
