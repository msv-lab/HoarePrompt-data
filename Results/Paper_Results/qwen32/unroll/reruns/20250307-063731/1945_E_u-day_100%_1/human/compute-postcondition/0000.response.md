The code snippet `n, k = func_1()` reassigns the values of `n` and `k` to whatever `func_1()` returns. The initial values of `n` and `k` are no longer valid as they have been updated. The precondition that `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n still holds, but with the new values returned by `func_1()`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, where `n` is a positive integer and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n.**
