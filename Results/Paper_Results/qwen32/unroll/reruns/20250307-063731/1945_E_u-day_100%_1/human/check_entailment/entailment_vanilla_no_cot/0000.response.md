Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The main issues are:

1. **Indexing Off-by-One Error**: The program uses 0-based indexing for the array `arr`, but the problem specifies that the swaps should be given in 1-based indexing. This means that the indices printed for the swaps are incorrect.

2. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search part of the code is correct in terms of logic, but the program does not ensure that after at most two swaps, the binary search will find `x` at `arr[low]`. The logic for determining when and how to swap elements is missing.

3. **Handling the Case When `x` is Not Found**: The program correctly prints `0` operations if `arr[low]` is equal to `x` after the binary search. However, if `x` is not found at `arr[low]`, the program only performs one swap and then checks again. It should be able to perform up to two swaps to ensure `x` is found at `arr[low]`.

4. **Logic for Two Swaps**: The program does not consider the possibility of needing two swaps to position `x` correctly. The strategy to ensure `x` is found after binary search with at most two swaps is not implemented.

5. **Output Format**: The output format is not strictly adhered to as the problem requires specific handling for the cases where `x` is not found after the first swap.

To fix the program, you would need to implement a strategy that ensures `x` is found after binary search with at most two swaps, taking into account the 1-based indexing requirement for the output.
