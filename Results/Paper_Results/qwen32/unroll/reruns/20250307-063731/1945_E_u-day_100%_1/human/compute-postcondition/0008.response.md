Let's analyze the given loop and understand how it modifies the variables `low`, `high`, and `st` based on the initial conditions and the behavior of the loop.

### Initial State:
- `n`: a positive integer
- `k`: an integer such that 1 <= k <= n
- `arr`: the value returned by `func_2()`
- `pos`: the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found
- `low`: 0
- `high`: n
- `st`: an empty set

### Loop Code:
```python
while low + 1 < high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    st.add(mid)
    if arr[mid] > k:
        high = mid
    else:
        low = mid
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The loop starts with `low = 0` and `high = n`.
2. **Condition**: The loop continues as long as `low + 1 < high`.
3. **Mid Calculation**: `mid` is calculated as the integer division of `(low + high) // 2`.
4. **Set Update**: `mid` is added to the set `st`.
5. **Comparison and Update**:
   - If `arr[mid] > k`, then `high` is updated to `mid`.
   - Otherwise, `low` is updated to `mid`.

### Loop Termination:
The loop terminates when `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`. At this point, `low` and `high` will be consecutive integers.

### Output State:
- **low**: The largest index such that `arr[low] <= k` and `low < high` at the end of the loop.
- **high**: The smallest index such that `arr[high] > k` and `low < high` at the end of the loop.
- **st**: A set containing all the `mid` values that were calculated during the loop iterations.

### Final Output State:
After the loop finishes, `low` will be the greatest index where `arr[low] <= k` and `high` will be the smallest index where `arr[high] > k` (or `high` will be the same as `low + 1` if no such index exists).

Output State: **low is the greatest index where arr[low] <= k, high is the smallest index where arr[high] > k, and st contains all mid values calculated during the loop.**
