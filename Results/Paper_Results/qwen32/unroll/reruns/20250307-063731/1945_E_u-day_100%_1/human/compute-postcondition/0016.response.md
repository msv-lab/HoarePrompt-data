Functionality: **The function determines the position of a specified integer `k` within a permutation of length `n` and prints specific values based on whether `k` is found in the permutation. If `k` is found, it prints `0`. If `k` is not found, it prints `1` followed by the greatest index where the elements are less than or equal to `k` and the position of `k` in the array, adjusted by 1.**
