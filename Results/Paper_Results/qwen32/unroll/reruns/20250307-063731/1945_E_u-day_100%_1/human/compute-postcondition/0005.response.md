Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, and `pos` remain unchanged. The variables `low` and `high` have been assigned the values 0 and `n`, respectively.
