The code assigns the result of `func_2()` to the variable `arr`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are the values returned by `func_1()`. Since the specific values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` are not provided, we can only state that `arr` now holds whatever value `func_2()` returns. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`.**
