### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - `func_1` reads a line of input and converts it into a map object of integers.
   - `func_2` converts the output of `func_1` into a list of integers.
   - `func_3` reads the length of the permutation `n` and the integer `k` to find, and then reads the permutation array `arr`.

2. **Finding the Position of `k`:**
   - `func_3` searches for the position of `k` in the array `arr` and stores it in `pos`. If `k` is not found, `pos` remains `-1`.

3. **Binary Search Simulation:**
   - `low` and `high` are initialized to `0` and `n`, respectively.
   - A while loop runs until `low + 1 < high`. Inside the loop, `mid` is calculated as the average of `low` and `high`.
   - If `arr[mid] > k`, `high` is updated to `mid`; otherwise, `low` is updated to `mid`.
   - The loop continues until `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`.

4. **Output:**
   - If `arr[low] == k`, it means `k` was found, and `0` is printed.
   - If `arr[low] != k`, it means `k` was not found, and `1` is printed, followed by the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

### Issues in the Code:

- **Handling of `pos` when `k` is not found:**
  - If `k` is not in the array, `pos` remains `-1`. The code attempts to print `low + 1, pos + 1` in this case. However, if `pos` is `-1`, `pos + 1` would be `0`, which is an invalid index. The problem requires valid indices `i` and `j` such that `1 <= i, j <= n`.
  
- **Swapping Strategy:**
  - The problem states that we can perform at most 2 swaps to make `p_l` equal to `x` after the binary search. The current code only handles one swap scenario and does not consider the possibility of performing two swaps if necessary.

### Correctness:

Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly handle all edge cases and does not ensure that the binary search will correctly identify `k` after the allowed number of swaps. Therefore, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
