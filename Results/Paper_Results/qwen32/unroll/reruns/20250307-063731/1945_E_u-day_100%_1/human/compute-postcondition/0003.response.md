The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is described as a positive integer, the loop will definitely execute at least once. The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts, as it will be initialized by the `range` function.

The variables `k`, `arr`, and `pos` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, for the sake of completeness in the state description, we can include them as they are provided.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is -1, `i` is not yet initialized**
