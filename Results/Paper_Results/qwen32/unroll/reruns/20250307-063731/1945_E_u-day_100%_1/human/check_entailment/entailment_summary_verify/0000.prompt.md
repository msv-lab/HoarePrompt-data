You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function determines the position of a specified integer `k` within a permutation of length `n` and prints specific values based on whether `k` is found in the permutation. If `k` is found, it prints `0`. If `k` is not found, it prints `1` followed by the greatest index where the elements are less than or equal to `k` and the position of `k` in the array, adjusted by 1.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not always correctly handle the problem description. The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before performing a binary search so that after the algorithm is executed, `p_l` is equal to `x`. The program is supposed to perform at most 2 swaps to achieve this.

Let's analyze the provided code:

1. **Finding the position of `x`**:
   ```python
   pos = -1
   for i in range(n):
       if arr[i] == k:
           pos = i
   ```
   This correctly finds the position of `x` in the array.

2. **Binary Search Simulation**:
   ```python
   (low, high) = (0, n)
   st = set()
   while low + 1 < high:
       mid = (low + high) // 2
       st.add(mid)
       if arr[mid] > k:
           high = mid
       else:
           low = mid
   ```
   This simulates the binary search process and keeps track of the `mid` values used in the search.

3. **Checking if `x` is found**:
   ```python
   if arr[low] == k:
       print(0)
   else:
       print(1)
       print(low + 1, pos + 1)
   ```
   If `x` is found at `arr[low]`, then no swaps are needed. Otherwise, the program suggests swapping the element at `low` with the element at `pos`.

### Potential Issue:
The program does not always perform the correct swaps to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search. Specifically, the program only performs one swap if `x` is not found at `arr[low]`. However, the problem guarantees that two swaps are always sufficient, and the program does not handle the case where one swap is not enough.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```
The correct output should be:
```
2
4 5
2 4
```
Explanation:
- Initially, the array is `[4, 3, 1, 5, 2, 6]`.
- The binary search steps would be:
  - `mid = (0 + 6) // 2 = 3`, `arr[3] = 5 > 3`, so `high = 3`.
  - `mid = (0 + 3) // 2 = 1`, `arr[1] = 3 == 3`, so `low = 1`.
- Since `x` is found at `arr[low]`, no swaps are needed, but the program does not correctly handle the scenario where `x` is not found at `arr[low]` and more than one swap is required.

The provided program does not account for all possible scenarios where two swaps are necessary to correctly position `x` for the binary search to find it at `p_l`.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
