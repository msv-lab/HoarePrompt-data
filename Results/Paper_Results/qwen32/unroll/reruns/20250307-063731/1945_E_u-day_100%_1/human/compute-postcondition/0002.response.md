The code snippet provided initializes the variable `pos` to -1. The variables `n`, `k`, and `arr` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is -1.**
