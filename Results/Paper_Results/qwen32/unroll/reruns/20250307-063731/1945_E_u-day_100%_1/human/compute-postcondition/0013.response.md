To determine what will be printed by the `print(low + 1, pos + 1)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the variables involved.

### Initial State Recap:
- `low` is the greatest index where `arr[low] <= k`.
- `high` is the smallest index where `arr[high] > k`.
- `st` contains all `mid` values calculated during the loop.
- `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.
- `pos` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but we can infer it might be related to `low` or `high` based on typical binary search contexts.

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `low`**: `low` is the greatest index where `arr[low] <= k`. This means that `arr[low]` is the largest element in `arr` that is less than or equal to `k`.
2. **Value of `high`**: `high` is the smallest index where `arr[high] > k`. This means that `arr[high]` is the smallest element in `arr` that is greater than `k`.
3. **Value of `pos`**: Since `pos` is not explicitly defined, we can infer that it might be a variable used in the loop to store an index or a result. Given the typical usage in binary search, `pos` could be the index of the element closest to `k` or the index where `k` would be inserted to maintain the order. However, without explicit information, we can assume `pos` is related to `low` or `high`.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is `print(low + 1, pos + 1)`. This means we need to print `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

Since `low` is the greatest index where `arr[low] <= k`, `low + 1` would be the next index after `low`. Similarly, `pos + 1` would be the next index after `pos`.

### Output:
Given the information, the output will be `low + 1` and `pos + 1`. Since the exact values of `low` and `pos` are not provided, we can only describe them based on their definitions.

Output: **low + 1, pos + 1 (where low is the greatest index where arr[low] <= k and pos is an index related to the search for k in arr)**
