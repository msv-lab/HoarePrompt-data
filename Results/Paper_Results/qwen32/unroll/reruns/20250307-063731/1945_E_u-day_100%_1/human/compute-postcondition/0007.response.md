To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `low + 1 < high`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n.
- `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`.
- `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found.
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is `n`.
- `st` is an empty set.

We need to ensure that `low + 1 < high` is true for the loop to execute. Initially, `low` is 0 and `high` is `n`, so `low + 1 < high` becomes `1 < n`. Since `n` is a positive integer, for `n` to be greater than 1, `n` must be at least 2.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is at least 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is an empty set**.
