### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`, and then reads the permutation `arr`.

2. **Finding the Position of `x`:**
   - The program correctly identifies the position `pos` of the element `x` in the permutation `arr`.

3. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The program initializes `low` and `high` as 0 and `n` respectively.
   - It performs a binary search to find the greatest index `low` such that `arr[low] <= x`.

4. **Checking the Result:**
   - If `arr[low] == x`, it means `x` is already at the correct position after the binary search, and the program correctly outputs `0` operations.
   - If `arr[low] != x`, the program outputs `1` operation and swaps the elements at positions `low + 1` and `pos + 1` (1-based indexing).

5. **Correctness of the Solution:**
   - The program correctly identifies if `x` is already in the correct position.
   - If not, it performs a single swap to place `x` at the correct position.
   - The problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient, but the program only performs 1 swap when necessary, which is within the allowed limit.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where `x` is the smallest or largest element in the permutation.
   - It also handles cases where `x` appears multiple times in the permutation by using the last occurrence of `x`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the solution as per the problem description. It ensures that after performing at most 1 swap, the binary search will correctly identify `x`.

### Correctness: **True**
