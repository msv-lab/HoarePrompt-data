To determine the output state, let's analyze the loop and how it modifies the variables.

The loop iterates over the array `arr` from index `0` to `n-1`. Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `arr[i]` is equal to `k`. If it is, it updates the variable `pos` to the current index `i`. This means that `pos` will hold the index of the last occurrence of `k` in the array `arr`. If `k` is not found in `arr`, `pos` remains `-1`.

Given that `n`, `k`, and `arr` are not modified in the loop, and `pos` is the only variable that can change, the output state will be:

- `n` remains the same.
- `k` remains the same.
- `arr` remains the same.
- `pos` will be the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or `-1` if `k` is not found.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found.**
