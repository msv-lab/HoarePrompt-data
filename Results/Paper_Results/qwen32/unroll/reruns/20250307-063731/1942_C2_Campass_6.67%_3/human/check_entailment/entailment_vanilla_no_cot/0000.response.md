Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are some key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Triangular Pieces:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the number of triangular pieces by considering the gaps between chosen vertices and adding additional vertices. However, it does not correctly account for the formation of non-intersecting triangles.
   - The logic for sorting and processing the gaps (`val`) and the way it adds triangles (`sx`) is flawed. It does not correctly maximize the number of non-intersecting triangles.

2. **Handling of Additional Vertices (`y`):**
   - The program incorrectly uses `y` to add vertices in a way that does not guarantee the maximum number of triangles. The strategy for using `y` to form triangles is not optimal.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, it might not correctly handle cases where the gaps between chosen vertices are very small or very large.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - The final calculation of `cons` is not correct. The formula `cons = x + sx - 2` does not properly account for the constraints and the goal of maximizing the number of triangles.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm that correctly identifies and forms non-intersecting triangles based on the chosen and additional vertices. The provided solution does not achieve this.

Hence, the program is incorrect.
