You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

- Program:
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    (t,) = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        (n, x, y) = R()
        sx = 0
        l = list(R())
        l.sort()
        l.append(n + l[0])
        val = []
        for i in range(1, x + 1):
            c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
            if c == 1:
                sx += 1
            val.append(c)
        val.sort(key=lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x))
        for i in val:
            c = i // 2
            if y < c:
                sx += y * 2
                break
            sx += i
            y -= c
        cons = x + sx - 2
        cons = min(n - 2, cons)
        print(cons)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases where each test case involves integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `cons` which represents a specific configuration based on the given constraints.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided code does not correctly compute the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed given the constraints. Here are the specific issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Vertices and Gaps:**
   - The code calculates the gaps between the vertices chosen by Bessie and tries to maximize the number of triangles by adding vertices. However, it does not correctly account for all possible ways to add vertices to maximize the number of triangles.
   - Specifically, the code calculates the gaps between the vertices and then tries to fill these gaps with the additional vertices. However, the logic for deciding how many vertices to add to each gap and the way it updates the count of triangles (`sx`) is flawed.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Triangles:**
   - The code attempts to calculate the number of triangles by adding vertices to gaps, but the logic for converting these gaps into triangles is not correct.
   - The formula used to update `sx` (number of triangles) is not consistent with the problem requirements. For example, the line `sx += i` and `sx += y * 2` do not correctly reflect the number of triangles that can be formed by adding vertices to gaps.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly:**
   - The code does not handle edge cases where the number of additional vertices (`y`) is zero or where the gaps between vertices are very small.
   - For example, if `y = 0`, the code should simply count the number of triangles that can be formed with the given vertices without adding any new vertices. However, the current logic does not handle this correctly.

### Counterexample:

Let's consider a test case where the code might fail:

```
Input:
1
8 4 2
1 6 2 5

Expected Output:
6

Actual Output from Code:
6 (This might seem correct, but let's consider another case)

Input:
1
7 3 1
1 3 5

Expected Output:
5

Actual Output from Code:
4 (This is incorrect)

Explanation:
- For the second test case, the code might not correctly handle the addition of one vertex to maximize the number of triangles.
- The correct way to add one vertex to maximize triangles in this case might be to add it between vertices 3 and 5, which would create more triangles than the code's current logic.
```

Given these issues, the code does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
