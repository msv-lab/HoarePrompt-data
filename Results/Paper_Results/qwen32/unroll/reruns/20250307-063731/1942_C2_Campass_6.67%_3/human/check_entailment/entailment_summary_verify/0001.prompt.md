You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

- Program:
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    (t,) = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        (n, x, y) = R()
        sx = 0
        l = list(R())
        l.sort()
        l.append(n + l[0])
        val = []
        for i in range(1, x + 1):
            c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
            if c == 1:
                sx += 1
            val.append(c)

            c = i // 2
            if y < c:
                sx += y * 2
                break
            sx += i
            y -= c
        cons = x + sx - 2
        cons = min(n - 2, cons)
        print(cons)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases where each test case involves integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `cons` which represents a specific configuration based on the given constraints.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to carefully analyze the logic and ensure it aligns with the problem requirements. Let's break down the code step by step:

### Problem Understanding
The problem involves a regular polygon with `n` sides, where `x` vertices are already chosen by Bessie. We can choose up to `y` additional vertices to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed.

### Key Concepts
1. **Vertices and Diagonals**: We need to use the chosen vertices to draw non-intersecting diagonals to form triangles.
2. **Triangle Formation**: A triangle is formed by three vertices, and the diagonals should not intersect.
3. **Maximizing Triangles**: We need to maximize the number of such triangles.

### Program Analysis
Let's go through the code line by line:

1. **Reading Input**:
   ```python
   R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
   (t,) = R()
   ```
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   ```python
   while t:
       t -= 1
       (n, x, y) = R()
       sx = 0
       l = list(R())
       l.sort()
       l.append(n + l[0])
   ```
   - Reads `n`, `x`, `y` for each test case.
   - Reads the `x` vertices chosen by Bessie, sorts them, and appends `n + l[0]` to handle circular nature.

3. **Calculating Gaps**:
   ```python
   val = []
   for i in range(1, x + 1):
       c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
       if c == 1:
           sx += 1
       val.append(c)
   val.sort(key=lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x))
   ```
   - Calculates the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices.
   - If a gap is 1, it means a triangle can be formed directly (without additional vertices).
   - Sorts the gaps to prioritize filling smaller gaps first.

4. **Filling Gaps with Additional Vertices**:
   ```python
   for i in val:
       c = i // 2
       if y < c:
           sx += y * 2
           break
       sx += i
       y -= c
   ```
   - Tries to fill each gap with the available vertices.
   - If not enough vertices are available to fill a gap, uses as many as possible.

5. **Calculating the Number of Triangles**:
   ```python
   cons = x + sx - 2
   cons = min(n - 2, cons)
   print(cons)
   ```
   - Calculates the total number of triangles.
   - Ensures the number of triangles does not exceed `n - 2` (maximum possible for a polygon).

### Correctness Analysis
- **Gap Calculation**: The program correctly calculates gaps between chosen vertices.
- **Sorting Gaps**: Sorting gaps to prioritize smaller gaps is a good strategy.
- **Filling Gaps**: The logic for filling gaps with additional vertices seems correct.
- **Triangle Calculation**: The final calculation of the number of triangles is correct.

However, there is a critical issue in the logic. The program does not correctly account for the fact that adding vertices can create multiple triangles. Specifically, the logic for `sx` (additional triangles) needs to be reconsidered. Adding a vertex in a gap can create more than one triangle, and the current logic might underestimate the number of triangles.

### Conclusion
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly the creation of multiple triangles by adding vertices in gaps. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
