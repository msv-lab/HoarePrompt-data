Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided code does not correctly compute the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed given the constraints. Here are the specific issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Vertices and Gaps:**
   - The code calculates the gaps between the vertices chosen by Bessie and tries to maximize the number of triangles by adding vertices. However, it does not correctly account for all possible ways to add vertices to maximize the number of triangles.
   - Specifically, the code calculates the gaps between the vertices and then tries to fill these gaps with the additional vertices. However, the logic for deciding how many vertices to add to each gap and the way it updates the count of triangles (`sx`) is flawed.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Triangles:**
   - The code attempts to calculate the number of triangles by adding vertices to gaps, but the logic for converting these gaps into triangles is not correct.
   - The formula used to update `sx` (number of triangles) is not consistent with the problem requirements. For example, the line `sx += i` and `sx += y * 2` do not correctly reflect the number of triangles that can be formed by adding vertices to gaps.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly:**
   - The code does not handle edge cases where the number of additional vertices (`y`) is zero or where the gaps between vertices are very small.
   - For example, if `y = 0`, the code should simply count the number of triangles that can be formed with the given vertices without adding any new vertices. However, the current logic does not handle this correctly.

### Counterexample:

Let's consider a test case where the code might fail:

```
Input:
1
8 4 2
1 6 2 5

Expected Output:
6

Actual Output from Code:
6 (This might seem correct, but let's consider another case)

Input:
1
7 3 1
1 3 5

Expected Output:
5

Actual Output from Code:
4 (This is incorrect)

Explanation:
- For the second test case, the code might not correctly handle the addition of one vertex to maximize the number of triangles.
- The correct way to add one vertex to maximize triangles in this case might be to add it between vertices 3 and 5, which would create more triangles than the code's current logic.
```

Given these issues, the code does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
