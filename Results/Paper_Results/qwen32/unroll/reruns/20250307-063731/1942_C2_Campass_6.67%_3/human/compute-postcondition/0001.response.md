Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of the first element returned by the lambda function `R()`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `R` is a lambda function that maps input to a list of integers.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to the first element of the list returned by the lambda function `R()`. All other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of vertices) remain unchanged as they have not been modified by the given code snippet.
