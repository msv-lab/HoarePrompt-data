Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of the first element returned by the lambda function `R()`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `R` is a lambda function that maps input to a list of integers.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, x, y = R()
    sx = 0
    l = list(R())
    l.sort()
    l.append(n + l[0])
    val = []
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
        if c == 1:
            sx += 1
        val.append(c)
    val.sort(key=lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x))
    for i in val:
        c = i // 2
        if y < c:
            sx += y * 2
            break
        sx += i
        y -= c
    cons = x + sx - 2
    cons = min(n - 2, cons)
    print(cons)



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
