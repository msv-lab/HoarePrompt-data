The given code snippet defines a lambda function `R` that maps the input to a list of integers. This lambda function is not used in the provided code snippet and does not directly affect the variables `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, or the list of vertices. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `R` is a lambda function that maps input to a list of integers.**
