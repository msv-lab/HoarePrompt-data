The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the length of the path, and the second line contains a string of n characters where each character is either '.', '@', or '*'. The character '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns. It is guaranteed that the first cell of the path is always empty ('.').
