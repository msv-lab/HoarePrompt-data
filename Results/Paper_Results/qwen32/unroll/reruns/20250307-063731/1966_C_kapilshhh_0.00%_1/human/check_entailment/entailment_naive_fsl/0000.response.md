Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 

The provided code contains a logical error in the last print statement. The statement `print('Alice' if dp else 'Alice')` always prints "Alice" regardless of the value of `dp`. This is clearly incorrect because the output should depend on the value of `dp` to determine whether Alice or Bob wins.

The correct print statement should be `print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')`.

Additionally, the logic for determining the winner seems to be flawed. The code is supposed to determine the winner based on the optimal play of both players. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the game's mechanics. Specifically, the game is essentially a variant of Nim where the piles are reduced by the smallest pile size on each turn. The correct approach to determine the winner involves calculating the Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes). If the Nim-sum is zero, the second player wins; otherwise, the first player wins.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    tc = int(input())
    while tc > 0:
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nim_sum = 0
        for x in arr:
            nim_sum ^= x
        print('Alice' if nim_sum != 0 else 'Bob')
        tc -= 1
```

This corrected version calculates the Nim-sum of the pile sizes and determines the winner based on whether the Nim-sum is non-zero (Alice wins) or zero (Bob wins).
