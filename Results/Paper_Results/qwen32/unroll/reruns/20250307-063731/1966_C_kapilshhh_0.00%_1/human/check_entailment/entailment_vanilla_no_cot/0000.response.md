Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a mistake in the print statement. It always prints "Alice" regardless of the value of `dp`. The correct print statement should be `print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')`. This change would make the program evaluate the `dp` variable correctly to determine the winner based on the game's rules.

Here is the corrected print statement part of the program:
```python
print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
```

With this correction, the program would be correct. However, the original program as provided is incorrect.
