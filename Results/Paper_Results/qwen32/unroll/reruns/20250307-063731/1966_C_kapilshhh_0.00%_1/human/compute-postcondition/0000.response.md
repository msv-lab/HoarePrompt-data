The code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `tc`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and for each test case, there is an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. These details remain unchanged except for the assignment of `tc`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `tc` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**
