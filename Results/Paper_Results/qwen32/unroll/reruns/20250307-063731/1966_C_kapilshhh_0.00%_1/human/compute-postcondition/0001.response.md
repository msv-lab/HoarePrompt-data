To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the state of `tc` such that `tc > 0`. The variable `t` is not relevant to the condition of the loop, so we do not need to adjust it.

Given the loop condition `while tc > 0:`, we need to make sure that `tc` is greater than 0 right before the loop starts.

State right before the while loop: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `tc` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, `tc` must be greater than 0. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `tc` to be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `tc` must be greater than 0**
