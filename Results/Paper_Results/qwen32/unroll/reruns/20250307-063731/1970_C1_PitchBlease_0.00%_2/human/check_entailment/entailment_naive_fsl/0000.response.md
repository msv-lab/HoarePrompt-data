Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description. Here are the problems:

1. **Global Variable Usage**: The `bfs` function uses a global variable `tree`, which is not defined within the `bfs` function. This will result in a `NameError` when the `bfs` function is called.

2. **Incorrect BFS Implementation**: The BFS function is supposed to find the shortest distance from the `start` node to the `target` node. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the `target` node is not reachable from the `start` node. Although the problem guarantees that the tree has exactly two leaves and the stone can always be moved to one of them, the implementation should still be robust.

3. **Incorrect Distance Check**: The logic to determine the winner is based on the parity of the distances from the `start` node to the two leaves. However, the code does not handle the case where the `start` node is one of the leaves. In this case, the distance to that leaf is 0, and the other distance is odd, but the code will still incorrectly return 'Ron'.

Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:

**Example:**
```
Input:
3 1
2 3
3 1
1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Hermione
```

**Explanation of the Example:**
- The tree is a line with nodes 1, 2, and 3, where 1 and 3 are the leaves.
- The stone starts at node 1.
- The distance from node 1 to node 1 is 0 (even).
- The distance from node 1 to node 3 is 2 (even).
- According to the code, since one of the distances is even, it will return 'Ron', which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 'Hermione' because the first player (Ron) cannot make a move if the stone starts at a leaf.

To fix these issues, the code should:
- Properly define the `tree` variable within the `bfs` function or pass it as an argument.
- Ensure that the BFS function correctly handles all cases.
- Correctly handle the case where the `start` node is one of the leaves.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        tree[v].append(u)
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]

    dist1 = bfs(tree, start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(tree, start, leaves[1])
    if dist1 % 2 == 0 or dist2 % 2 == 0:
        return 'Ron'
    else:
        return 'Hermione'

def bfs(tree, start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        (current, dist) = queue.popleft()
        if current == target:
            return dist
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
    return -1
```

This corrected version should work correctly for all valid inputs according to the problem description.
