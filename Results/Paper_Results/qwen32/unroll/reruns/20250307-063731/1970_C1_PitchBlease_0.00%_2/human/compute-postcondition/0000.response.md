The code snippet initializes a deque with a single tuple containing the `start` node and the distance `0`. This means that the `queue` now holds the initial node from which the traversal or search will begin, and the distance from the start node to itself is `0`.

Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, where 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n; `tree` is an adjacency list representing the tree structure with n nodes; `queue` is a deque containing the tuple `((start, 0))`.**
