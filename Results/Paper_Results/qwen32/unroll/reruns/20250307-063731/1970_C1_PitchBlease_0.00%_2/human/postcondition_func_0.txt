The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree, a list of tuples `edges` representing the edges of the tree, and an integer `start` representing the starting node. It returns 'Ron' if the shortest distance from the starting node to at least one of the leaves in the tree is even, otherwise it returns 'Hermione'.
