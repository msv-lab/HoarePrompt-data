Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents an edge in the tree with 1 <= u, v <= n, `start` is an integer representing the starting node where 1 <= start <= n, `tree` is a defaultdict of lists that represents an adjacency list of the tree, where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of adjacent nodes, `leaves` is a list of nodes from `tree` that have exactly one adjacent node, `dist1` is the shortest distance from `start` to `leaves[0]`, `dist2` is the shortest distance from `start` to `leaves[1]`. Both `dist1` and `dist2` are odd integers.**
