You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to maximize the beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, by rearranging the elements of the array.

### Program Analysis

#### Function 1: `func_1(array)`
- **Sorting**: The array is sorted.
- **Beauty Calculation**: The beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
- **Correctness**: Sorting the array in ascending or descending order will ensure that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This is because the largest differences will be between the smallest and largest elements, and sorting ensures these are adjacent in the sequence.

#### Function 2: `func_2()`
- **Input Handling**: Reads input from standard input, parses the number of test cases, and for each test case, reads the length of the array and the array elements.
- **Result Calculation**: For each test case, it calls `func_1(array)` to calculate the beauty and stores the result.
- **Output**: Prints the results for all test cases.

### Verification
Let's verify the program against the provided examples and edge cases:

1. **Example 1**: 
   - Input: `3 2 1 3`
   - Sorted: `1 2 3`
   - Beauty: `(2-1) + (3-2) = 2`
   - **Matches Expected Output**: `2`

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `3 69 69 69`
   - Sorted: `69 69 69`
   - Beauty: `(69-69) + (69-69) = 0`
   - **Matches Expected Output**: `0`

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `5 100 54 80 43 90`
   - Sorted: `43 54 80 90 100`
   - Beauty: `(54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57`
   - **Matches Expected Output**: `57`

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: `4 3 4 3 3`
   - Sorted: `3 3 3 4`
   - Beauty: `(3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
   - **Matches Expected Output**: `1`

5. **Example 5**:
   - Input: `2 2 1`
   - Sorted: `1 2`
   - Beauty: `(2-1) = 1`
   - **Matches Expected Output**: `1`

### Edge Cases
- **All Elements Same**: The beauty should be `0` as all differences will be `0`.
- **Two Elements**: The beauty will be the absolute difference between the two elements.
- **Already Sorted**: The beauty should be the same as the beauty of the sorted array.

### Conclusion
The program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array for the provided examples and edge cases. It sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, which is the optimal approach to maximize the beauty.

**Correctness: True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array for all the provided test cases and edge cases.
