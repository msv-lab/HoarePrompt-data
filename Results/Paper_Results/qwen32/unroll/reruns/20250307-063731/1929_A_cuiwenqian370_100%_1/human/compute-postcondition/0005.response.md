To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. This implies that the loop will execute `t` times.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `array` is a list of integers with length `n` such that `2 <= n <= 100`, and each integer in the array is between `1` and `10^9` inclusive.
- `input` is `sys.stdin.read`.
- `data` is a list of strings, each representing an integer from the input.
- `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`.
- `index` is `1`.
- `results` is an empty list.

The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least `1`. 

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

- `t` must be at least `1` for the loop to execute.
- The other variables (`array`, `input`, `data`, `index`, `results`) do not directly affect whether the loop will execute, so they don't need to be modified for the loop to start.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`array` is a list of integers with length `n` such that `2 <= n <= 100`, and each integer in the array is between `1` and `10^9` inclusive; `input` is `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing an integer from the input; `t` must be at least `1`; `index` is `1`; `results` is an empty list.**
