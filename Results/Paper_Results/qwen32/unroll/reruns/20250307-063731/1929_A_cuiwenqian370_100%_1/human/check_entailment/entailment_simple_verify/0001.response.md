### Reasoning:

The original assessment provides a detailed analysis of the problem and the program. Let's break down the key points and verify the correctness of the program step-by-step:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - To maximize the beauty, the array should be sorted either in ascending or descending order. Sorting in either order ensures that the absolute differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1(array)`**:
     - The function sorts the array.
     - It then calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
     - **Annotation**: The array is sorted, and the beauty is computed correctly as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - **Function `func_2()`**:
     - Reads input from standard input.
     - Processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the appropriate array.
     - Collects the results and prints them.
     - **Annotation**: Handles multiple test cases correctly, reads input, processes it, and prints the results.

3. **Verification**:
   - Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
   - The loop in `func_1` correctly sums the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases and ensures that the input is read and processed correctly.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. Both functions work together to solve the problem as described. The program correctly sorts the array and calculates the maximum beauty for each test case.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
