To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand what the loop does and how the variables change throughout its execution. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State Recap**:
   - `array` is a list of integers.
   - `input` is `sys.stdin.read`.
   - `data` is a list of strings, each representing an integer from the input.
   - `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` (number of test cases).
   - `index` is 1.
   - `results` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs `t` times.
   - In each iteration:
     - `n` is set to the integer value of `data[index]` (length of the array for the current test case).
     - `index` is incremented by 1.
     - `array` is updated to a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`.
     - `index` is incremented by `n`.
     - `result` is computed by calling `func_1(array)`.
     - `result` is appended to the `results` list.

3. **Final State**:
   - After all iterations, `index` will have been incremented by `1 + n` for each test case, where `n` is the length of the array for each test case.
   - `results` will contain the results of `func_1(array)` for each test case.

Given the above, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`array` is the last array processed in the loop, `index` is the final index after processing all test cases, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(array)` for each test case, and other variables remain unchanged.**
