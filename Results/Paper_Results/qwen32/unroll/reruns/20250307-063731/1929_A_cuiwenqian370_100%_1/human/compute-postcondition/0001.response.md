The code snippet reads a line of input from `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings using the `split()` method. This means that `data` will be a list of strings, where each string is a substring from the input, separated by whitespace.

Given the initial state, `array` is a list of integers, and `input` is `sys.stdin.read`. After executing the code snippet, `data` will be a list of strings that were originally integers in the input.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers with length n such that 2 <= n <= 100, and each integer in the array is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; `input` is `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing an integer from the input.**
