### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key strategy for maximizing the beauty of the array, which is to sort the array. Here's a detailed breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Sorting the Array**:
   - Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This is because the largest differences will naturally occur between the smallest and largest elements, and sorting ensures these are adjacent in the sequence.
   - For example, in the array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, sorting it to `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]` results in the maximum possible sum of consecutive differences.

2. **Beauty Calculation**:
   - The beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements this by iterating through the sorted array and summing up the differences.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - `func_2` correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and computes the result using `func_1`.
   - It handles multiple test cases and prints the results as required.

4. **Verification Against Examples**:
   - The program correctly computes the beauty for all the provided examples, matching the expected outputs.
   - For example, in the first test case with input `3 2 1 3`, the sorted array is `[1, 2, 3]`, and the beauty is `(2-1) + (3-2) = 2`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as arrays with all identical elements, arrays with only two elements, and arrays that are already sorted.
   - For instance, in the second test case with input `3 69 69 69`, the sorted array remains `[69, 69, 69]`, and the beauty is `0`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and calculating the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. The program is verified to work correctly for the provided examples and edge cases.

**Final: True**
