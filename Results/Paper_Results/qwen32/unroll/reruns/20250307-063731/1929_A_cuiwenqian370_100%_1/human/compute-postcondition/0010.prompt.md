You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers with length n such that 2 <= n <= 100, and each integer in the array is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(array)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: `array` is the last array processed in the loop, `index` is the final index after processing all test cases, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(array)` for each test case, and other variables remain unchanged.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: array is the last array processed in the loop, index is the final index after processing all test cases, results is a list containing the results of `func_1(array)` for each test case, and the loop has printed each result in the `results` list. Other variables remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `array`, which is a list of integers with length `n` such that 2 <= n <= 100, and each integer in the array is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The function returns the maximum value in the array.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
