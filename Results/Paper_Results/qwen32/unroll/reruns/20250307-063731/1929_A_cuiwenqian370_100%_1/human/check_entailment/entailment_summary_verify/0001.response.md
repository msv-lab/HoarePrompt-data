To determine if the given Python program is correct, let's systematically analyze the problem, the program code, and the function summaries.

### Problem Analysis
The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements when the array is arranged in a certain order. The task is to find the maximum possible beauty by rearranging the elements of the array.

### Key Insight
To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This can be achieved by arranging the array in either ascending or descending order. In both cases, the absolute differences between consecutive elements will be maximized.

### Program Analysis
The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(array)`: This function sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads input from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Function Summaries
- **Function `func_1(array)`**: The function sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
- **Function `func_2()`**: The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Verification
Let's verify if `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum beauty:
- Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
- The loop correctly sums the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

The `func_2` function correctly handles multiple test cases and ensures that the input is read and processed correctly.

### Detailed Verification with Examples
Let's verify the program using the provided example inputs and outputs.

#### Example 1:
**Input:**
```
3
2 1 3
```
**Processing:**
- Sorted array: `[1, 2, 3]`
- Beauty: `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2`

**Output:**
```
2
```

#### Example 2:
**Input:**
```
3
69 69 69
```
**Processing:**
- Sorted array: `[69, 69, 69]`
- Beauty: `(69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0 + 0 = 0`

**Output:**
```
0
```

#### Example 3:
**Input:**
```
5
100 54 80 43 90
```
**Processing:**
- Sorted array: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
- Beauty: `(54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57`

**Output:**
```
57
```

#### Example 4:
**Input:**
```
4
3 4 3 3
```
**Processing:**
- Sorted array: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
- Beauty: `(3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`

**Output:**
```
1
```

#### Example 5:
**Input:**
```
2
2 1
```
**Processing:**
- Sorted array: `[1, 2]`
- Beauty: `(2 - 1) = 1`

**Output:**
```
1
```

### Conclusion
The program correctly sorts the array and calculates the maximum beauty for each test case. The function summaries and the behavior of the functions align with the problem description and the examples provided.

### Final Answer
Final: **True**
