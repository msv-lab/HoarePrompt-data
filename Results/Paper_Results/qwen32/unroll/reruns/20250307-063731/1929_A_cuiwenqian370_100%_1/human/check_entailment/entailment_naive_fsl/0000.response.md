Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to maximize the beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, by rearranging the elements of the array.

### Program Analysis

#### Function 1: `func_1(array)`
- **Sorting**: The array is sorted.
- **Beauty Calculation**: The beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
- **Correctness**: Sorting the array in ascending or descending order will ensure that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This is because the largest differences will be between the smallest and largest elements, and sorting ensures these are adjacent in the sequence.

#### Function 2: `func_2()`
- **Input Handling**: Reads input from standard input, parses the number of test cases, and for each test case, reads the length of the array and the array elements.
- **Result Calculation**: For each test case, it calls `func_1(array)` to calculate the beauty and stores the result.
- **Output**: Prints the results for all test cases.

### Verification
Let's verify the program against the provided examples and edge cases:

1. **Example 1**: 
   - Input: `3 2 1 3`
   - Sorted: `1 2 3`
   - Beauty: `(2-1) + (3-2) = 2`
   - **Matches Expected Output**: `2`

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `3 69 69 69`
   - Sorted: `69 69 69`
   - Beauty: `(69-69) + (69-69) = 0`
   - **Matches Expected Output**: `0`

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `5 100 54 80 43 90`
   - Sorted: `43 54 80 90 100`
   - Beauty: `(54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57`
   - **Matches Expected Output**: `57`

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: `4 3 4 3 3`
   - Sorted: `3 3 3 4`
   - Beauty: `(3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
   - **Matches Expected Output**: `1`

5. **Example 5**:
   - Input: `2 2 1`
   - Sorted: `1 2`
   - Beauty: `(2-1) = 1`
   - **Matches Expected Output**: `1`

### Edge Cases
- **All Elements Same**: The beauty should be `0` as all differences will be `0`.
- **Two Elements**: The beauty will be the absolute difference between the two elements.
- **Already Sorted**: The beauty should be the same as the beauty of the sorted array.

### Conclusion
The program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array for the provided examples and edge cases. It sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, which is the optimal approach to maximize the beauty.

**Correctness: True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array for all the provided test cases and edge cases.
