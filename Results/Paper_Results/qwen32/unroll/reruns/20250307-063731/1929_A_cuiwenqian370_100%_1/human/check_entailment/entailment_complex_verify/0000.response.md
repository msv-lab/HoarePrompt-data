### Reasoning:

The original assessment provides a comprehensive and accurate evaluation of the program. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Sorting the Array**: 
   - The program sorts the array, which is a correct strategy to maximize the beauty. When the array is sorted, the absolute differences between consecutive elements are maximized, ensuring the highest possible beauty.

2. **Beauty Calculation**:
   - The beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. Since the array is sorted, these differences are maximized, which aligns with the problem's requirement to maximize the beauty.

3. **Function `func_1(array)`**:
   - The function correctly sorts the array and computes the beauty as described. The annotations validate this behavior, showing that the array is indeed sorted and the beauty is calculated based on the sorted array.

4. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function handles the input parsing and processes each test case by calling `func_1(array)`. It correctly reads the number of test cases and the elements of each array, processes them, and stores the results. The annotations confirm that the function correctly processes each test case and prints the results.

5. **Verification Against Examples**:
   - The original assessment verifies the program against all provided examples, showing that the program produces the correct output for each test case. This includes edge cases such as arrays with all identical elements, arrays with only two elements, and already sorted arrays.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The assessment considers edge cases, confirming that the program handles them correctly. For example, when all elements are the same, the beauty is correctly calculated as 0, and for arrays with only two elements, the beauty is the absolute difference between the two elements.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis and the annotations, the program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array for all provided test cases and edge cases. The original assessment is accurate.

**Final: **True**
