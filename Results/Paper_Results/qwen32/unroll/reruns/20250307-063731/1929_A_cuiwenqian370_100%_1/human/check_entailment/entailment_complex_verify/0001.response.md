### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to verify its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements when the array is arranged in a certain order. The goal is to find the maximum possible beauty by rearranging the elements of the array.

#### Key Insight:
To maximize the beauty, the array should be sorted in either ascending or descending order. Sorting ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(array)`: This function sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads input from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

#### Verification:
Let's verify if `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum beauty:
- **Sorting the array**: Sorting the array in ascending or descending order ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
- **Calculating beauty**: The loop correctly sums the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

The `func_2` function correctly handles multiple test cases and ensures that the input is read and processed correctly.

#### Annotations:
The annotations provided describe the state of the program at key points:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
  - Before the function call: The array is a list of integers with length `n` such that `2 <= n <= 100`, and each integer in the array satisfies `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`.
  - After sorting and calculating beauty: The array is a sorted list of integers, and `beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
  - Before the function call: The input is read as a list of integers, and the first integer `t` represents the number of test cases.
  - After processing each test case: The array is the last array processed in the loop, `index` is the final index after processing all test cases, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(array)` for each test case, and other variables remain unchanged.

#### Conclusion:
Both functions work together to solve the problem as described. The program correctly sorts the array and calculates the maximum beauty for each test case.

### Final Answer:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array for each test case by sorting the array and summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

Final: **True**
