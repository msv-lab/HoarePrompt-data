### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after potentially rearranging the elements. The key to maximizing this beauty is to sort the array in either ascending or descending order. This is because the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements is maximized when the differences are maximized, which happens when the elements are sorted in one of these orders.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Reads the input, which consists of multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the elements of the array.
   - Calls `func_1` with the array and stores the result in a list `results`.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Sorts the array.
   - Computes the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - Returns the computed beauty.

The sorting step ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, which is the key to achieving the maximum beauty. The absolute difference calculation is correct because the array is sorted, making the difference between consecutive elements non-negative.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and summing the differences between consecutive elements. Thus, the program is correct.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The program correctly sorts the array and computes the beauty as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, which maximizes the beauty.
Correctness: **True**
