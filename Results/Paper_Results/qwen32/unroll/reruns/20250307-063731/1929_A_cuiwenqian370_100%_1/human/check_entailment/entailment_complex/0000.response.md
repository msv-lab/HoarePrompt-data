### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after the array has been rearranged optimally. The beauty of the array can be maximized by sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the provided functions and their roles:

1. **Function `func_1(array)`**:
   - **Input**: A list of integers `array` with length `n` such that `2 <= n <= 100`, and each integer in the array satisfies `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`.
   - **Process**:
     - The array is sorted in ascending order.
     - The beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
     - The function returns this beauty value.
   - **Output**: The maximum beauty of the array after sorting it.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - **Input**: Reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - **Process**:
     - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, reads the length of the array `n` and the `n` integers that form the array.
     - Calls `func_1(array)` to compute the beauty for each array.
     - Stores the results in a list `results`.
     - Prints each result in the `results` list.
   - **Output**: Prints the maximum beauty for each test case.

### Verification:

- **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array in ascending order ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, leading to the maximum beauty.
- **Beauty Calculation**: The beauty is correctly computed as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
- **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading inputs, processing each test case independently, and storing and printing the results.

### Conclusion:

The provided functions together correctly solve the problem by sorting the array to maximize the beauty and then calculating the beauty for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
