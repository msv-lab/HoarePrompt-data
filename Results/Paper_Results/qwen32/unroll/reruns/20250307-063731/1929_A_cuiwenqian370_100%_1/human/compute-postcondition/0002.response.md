Output State: **`array` is a list of integers with length n such that 2 <= n <= 100, and each integer in the array is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; `input` is `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing an integer from the input; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`.**

In simple terms, the value of `t` is now the integer representation of the first element in the `data` list, while all other variables remain unchanged.
