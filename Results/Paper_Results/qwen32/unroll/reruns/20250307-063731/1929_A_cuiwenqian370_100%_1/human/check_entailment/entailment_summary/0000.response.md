### Reasoning:
The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. Hereâ€™s the breakdown of how each function works and how they contribute to solving the problem:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: To calculate the beauty of a given array.
   - **Implementation**: The function sorts the array in ascending order and then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - **Output**: The beauty of the array, which is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - **Correctness**: Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, leading to the maximum possible beauty. Since the problem specifies that the beauty is defined as the sum of `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`, sorting the array in ascending order guarantees that each difference `(a_i - a_{i-1})` is non-negative and maximized.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: To handle multiple test cases by reading input, processing each test case using `func_1`, and printing the results.
   - **Implementation**: The function reads input from standard input, which includes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements, then computes the beauty using `func_1`, and finally prints the result.
   - **Output**: The function prints the beauty of each test case.
   - **Correctness**: The function correctly processes multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to compute the beauty, ensuring that the output is as expected.

### Conclusion:
Both functions work together to solve the problem as described. `func_1` correctly computes the maximum beauty of an array by sorting it, and `func_2` manages the input and output for multiple test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
