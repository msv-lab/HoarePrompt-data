Output State: **`array` is a list of integers with length n such that 2 <= n <= 100, and each integer in the array is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; `input` is `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing an integer from the input; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`; `index` is 1.**

In this output state, the only change is the assignment of the value `1` to the variable `index`. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
