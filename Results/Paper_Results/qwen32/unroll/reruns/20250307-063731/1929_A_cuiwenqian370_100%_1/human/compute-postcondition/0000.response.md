The given code snippet assigns the `sys.stdin.read` function to the variable `input`. This action does not change the initial state of the array or its properties. The only change is the introduction of the `input` variable that now holds a reference to the `sys.stdin.read` function.

Output State: **array is a list of integers with length n such that 2 <= n <= 100, and each integer in the array is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; `input` is `sys.stdin.read`.**
