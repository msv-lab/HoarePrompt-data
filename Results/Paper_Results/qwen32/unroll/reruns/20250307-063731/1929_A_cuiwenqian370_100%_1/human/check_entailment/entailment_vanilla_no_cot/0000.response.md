Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array. The function `func_1` calculates the beauty of a sorted array, which does not necessarily yield the maximum beauty. To maximize the beauty, the array should be rearranged such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This can be achieved by sorting the array and then arranging the elements in an alternating pattern of the largest and smallest remaining elements.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    n = len(array)
    # Use two pointers to maximize the difference
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    prev = None
    while left <= right:
        if prev is not None:
            beauty += abs(array[right] - prev)
        prev = array[right]
        right -= 1
        if left <= right:
            if prev is not None:
                beauty += abs(array[left] - prev)
            prev = array[left]
            left += 1
    return beauty
```

This version of `func_1` sorts the array and then uses two pointers to alternate between the largest and smallest remaining elements, maximizing the differences and thus the beauty of the array.
