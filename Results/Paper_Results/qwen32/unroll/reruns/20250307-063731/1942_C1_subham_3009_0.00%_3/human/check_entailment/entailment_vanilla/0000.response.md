Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.
2. **Constraints**:
   - The cake is a regular polygon with `n` sides.
   - `x` vertices have already been chosen.
   - `y` additional vertices can be chosen (`y = 0` in this problem).
   - Diagonals must be drawn between chosen vertices.
   - Triangles formed by these diagonals are counted.
3. **Output**: For each test case, output the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution reads the input and then for each test case, it calculates the number of triangles as `x - 2`.

### Reasoning:
1. **Vertices and Triangles**:
   - When `x` vertices are chosen, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `x - 2`.
   - This is a well-known result from graph theory and computational geometry, where choosing `x` vertices allows you to form `x - 2` triangles by drawing non-intersecting diagonals.
2. **Why `x - 2`?**:
   - For `x` vertices, you can form a triangulation of a polygon with `x` vertices, which results in `x - 2` triangles.
   - This is because each triangle uses 3 vertices, and each additional triangle after the first one uses 1 new vertex (since the first triangle uses 3, the second uses 1 more, and so on, until all `x` vertices are used).

### Conclusion:
The solution provided correctly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake for each test case by outputting `x - 2`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
