You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

- Program: 
def func():
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
            arr = input().split()

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and y is 0. Additionally, there are x distinct integers in the range from 1 to n representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, and the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    if (__name__ == '__main__') :
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            
            [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
            
            arr = input().split()
            
            arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
            
            print(x - 2)
            
        #State: - The variable `t` will be 0 after the loop finishes, as it is decremented in each iteration until it reaches zero.
        #- The variables `n`, `x`, and `y` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop.
        #- The variable `arr` will hold the list of integers from the last iteration of the loop.
        #- The output of the program will be a series of `x - 2` values, one for each iteration.
        #
        #However, the problem asks for the output state in terms of the variables in the loop head and body. Since `t` will be 0 after the loop, and the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` will be from the last iteration, we can describe the final state as follows:
        #
        #Output State:
    #State: `t` is 0 after the loop finishes, and `n`, `x`, and `y` hold the values from the last iteration of the loop. The variable `arr` contains the list of integers from the last iteration of the loop. The output of the program is a series of `x - 2` values, one for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where for each test case it reads integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (with `y` always being 0), followed by `x` distinct integers representing vertices. It outputs `x - 2` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.
2. **Constraints**:
   - The cake is a regular polygon with `n` sides.
   - `x` vertices have already been chosen.
   - `y` additional vertices can be chosen (`y = 0` in this problem).
   - Diagonals must be drawn between chosen vertices.
   - Triangles formed by these diagonals are counted.
3. **Output**: For each test case, output the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution reads the input and then for each test case, it calculates the number of triangles as `x - 2`.

### Reasoning:
1. **Vertices and Triangles**:
   - When `x` vertices are chosen, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `x - 2`.
   - This is a well-known result from graph theory and computational geometry, where choosing `x` vertices allows you to form `x - 2` triangles by drawing non-intersecting diagonals.
2. **Why `x - 2`?**:
   - For `x` vertices, you can form a triangulation of a polygon with `x` vertices, which results in `x - 2` triangles.
   - This is because each triangle uses 3 vertices, and each additional triangle after the first one uses 1 new vertex (since the first triangle uses 3, the second uses 1 more, and so on, until all `x` vertices are used).

### Conclusion:
The solution provided correctly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake for each test case by outputting `x - 2`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
