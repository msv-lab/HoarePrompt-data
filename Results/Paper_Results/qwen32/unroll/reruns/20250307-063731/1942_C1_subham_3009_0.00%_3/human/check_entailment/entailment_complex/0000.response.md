### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

#### Problem Understanding:
- We have a regular polygon with `n` sides.
- Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices to form diagonals.
- We are allowed to choose up to `y` additional vertices (but `y` is always 0 in this version).
- The goal is to form the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces using the chosen vertices.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Triangular Pieces**: To form a triangle, we need 3 vertices.
2. **Non-Intersecting Diagonals**: The diagonals formed should not intersect with each other.
3. **Maximizing Triangles**: The maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using `x` vertices is `x - 2` when `x` vertices are in a convex polygon (which is the case here since the vertices are part of a regular polygon).

#### Explanation of the Program:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` (where `y` is always 0).
- It then reads the `x` vertices Bessie has chosen.
- The program outputs `x - 2` for each test case.

#### Correctness Check:
- The output of `x - 2` is correct for the problem because:
  - When `x` vertices are chosen in a convex polygon, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is indeed `x - 2`.
  - This is a well-known result in computational geometry and graph theory.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces for each test case.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
