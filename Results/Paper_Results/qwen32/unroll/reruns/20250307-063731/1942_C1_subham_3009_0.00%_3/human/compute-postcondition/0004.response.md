Postcondition: **`t` is 0 after the loop finishes, and `n`, `x`, and `y` hold the values from the last iteration of the loop. The variable `arr` contains the list of integers from the last iteration of the loop. The output of the program is a series of `x - 2` values, one for each iteration.**

Given the provided information, the if statement does not actually contain any conditional logic or an else part, but rather seems to describe the state after a loop completes. The postcondition should reflect the final state of the variables and the output of the program.
