The code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer input represents the number of test cases. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet. The output state will reflect the updated value of `t` and retain the preconditions for the other variables.

Output State: **t is the integer input value, n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and y is 0. Additionally, there are x distinct integers in the range from 1 to n representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, and the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The current execution is within the main module, as indicated by `__name__ == '__main__'`.**
