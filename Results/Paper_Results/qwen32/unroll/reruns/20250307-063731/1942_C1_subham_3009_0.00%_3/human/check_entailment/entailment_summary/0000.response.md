### Reasoning:
The program is supposed to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the given vertices. According to the problem statement, `y` is always 0, meaning no additional vertices can be chosen. The key part of the problem is to maximize the number of triangles using the `x` vertices already chosen.

The program reads the inputs correctly and outputs `x - 2` for each test case. This output is based on the observation that if you have `x` vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles you can form is `x - 2`. This is a well-known result in combinatorial geometry, where the vertices can be connected to form a triangulation of a polygon.

For example, if you have 4 vertices, you can form 2 non-intersecting triangles. If you have 5 vertices, you can form 3 non-intersecting triangles, and so on. The formula `x - 2` correctly gives the maximum number of triangles that can be formed with `x` vertices in a non-intersecting manner.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the given vertices, given that `y` is always 0.
