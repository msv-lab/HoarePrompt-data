To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and its behavior over the iterations.

Here's a breakdown of the loop:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The loop continues as long as `t > 0`.
   - For each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1.
   - The input is read, consisting of three integers: `n`, `x`, and `y`. 
   - An additional line of input is read, which consists of `x` distinct integers representing vertices.

2. **Processing:**
   - The input list of `x` integers is converted to a list of integers.
   - The code then prints `x - 2`.

3. **Output:**
   - For each iteration, `x - 2` is printed.

4. **State Transition:**
   - The variables `n`, `x`, and `y` are re-assigned in each iteration based on the input.
   - The variable `arr` is a list of `x` integers read from the input, but it is not used further in the loop.
   - The variable `t` is used to control the loop and is decremented in each iteration until it reaches zero.

Given the above, the loop will execute `t` times, and in each iteration, it will print `x - 2`.

**Output State:**
- The variable `t` will be 0 after the loop finishes, as it is decremented in each iteration until it reaches zero.
- The variables `n`, `x`, and `y` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop.
- The variable `arr` will hold the list of integers from the last iteration of the loop.
- The output of the program will be a series of `x - 2` values, one for each iteration.

However, the problem asks for the output state in terms of the variables in the loop head and body. Since `t` will be 0 after the loop, and the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` will be from the last iteration, we can describe the final state as follows:

Output State: **t is 0, n, x, and y are from the last iteration, and arr is the list of integers from the last iteration.**

In natural language, after the loop has finished executing, `t` will be 0, and the variables `n`, `x`, and `y` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop. The list `arr` will contain the integers from the last iteration. The program will have printed `x - 2` for each iteration of the loop.
