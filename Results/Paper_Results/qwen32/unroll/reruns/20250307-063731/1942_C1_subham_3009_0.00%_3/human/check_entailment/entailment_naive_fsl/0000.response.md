Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly compute the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed. The program simply returns `x - 2` for each test case, which is not a correct approach to solving the problem.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the vertices that Bessie has chosen and determine how many non-intersecting triangles can be formed using these vertices. The provided code does not implement any logic to achieve this.

Let's consider a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
6 3 0
1 3 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation:**
With vertices 1, 3, and 5 chosen, we can form one triangle (1-3-5) without any intersections.

**Actual Output of Provided Code:**
```
1
```

While the provided code happens to give the correct output for this specific case, it is not a general solution. Let's consider another case:

**Input:**
```
1
6 4 0
1 2 4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
With vertices 1, 2, 4, and 5 chosen, we can form two triangles (1-2-4 and 2-4-5) without any intersections.

**Actual Output of Provided Code:**
```
2
```

Again, the provided code happens to give the correct output for this specific case. However, the code does not handle all cases correctly. For example:

**Input:**
```
1
6 4 0
1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
With vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4 chosen, we can form two triangles (1-2-3 and 2-3-4) without any intersections.

**Actual Output of Provided Code:**
```
2
```

The code continues to return `x - 2` for all cases, which is not a correct general solution. The correct approach involves using a more sophisticated algorithm to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed with the given vertices.

Since the provided code does not correctly handle all cases and does not implement a proper algorithm to solve the problem, it is incorrect.
