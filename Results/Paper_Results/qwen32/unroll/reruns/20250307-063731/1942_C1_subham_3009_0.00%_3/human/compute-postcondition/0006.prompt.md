You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and y is 0. Additionally, there are x distinct integers in the range from 1 to n representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, and the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    if (__name__ == '__main__') :
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            
            [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
            
            arr = input().split()
            
            arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
            
            print(x - 2)
            
        #State: - The variable `t` will be 0 after the loop finishes, as it is decremented in each iteration until it reaches zero.
        #- The variables `n`, `x`, and `y` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop.
        #- The variable `arr` will hold the list of integers from the last iteration of the loop.
        #- The output of the program will be a series of `x - 2` values, one for each iteration.
        #
        #However, the problem asks for the output state in terms of the variables in the loop head and body. Since `t` will be 0 after the loop, and the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` will be from the last iteration, we can describe the final state as follows:
        #
        #Output State:
    #State: `t` is 0 after the loop finishes, and `n`, `x`, and `y` hold the values from the last iteration of the loop. The variable `arr` contains the list of integers from the last iteration of the loop. The output of the program is a series of `x - 2` values, one for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), an integer `x` (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)), and an integer `y` which is always 0. Additionally, it receives `x` distinct integers in the range from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The function returns a result for each test case based on the provided inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
