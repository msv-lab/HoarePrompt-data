Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine the year in which the nth sign occurs, considering that each sign must occur sequentially. The ith sign occurs every a_i years, and the (i+1)th sign must occur strictly after the ith sign.

### Program Analysis:
The program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the number of signs, n.
   - It reads the list of periodicities, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
   - It initializes a variable `start_year` to 0.
   - It iterates through each sign's periodicity:
     - It calculates the next occurrence of the sign after the current `start_year` by using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
     - It updates `start_year` to this new value.
   - It prints the final `start_year` after processing all signs.

### Detailed Reasoning:
- The formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` correctly computes the next occurrence of the sign after `start_year`. This is because:
  - `start_year // nums[x]` gives the quotient of `start_year` divided by `nums[x]`, representing the number of complete cycles of `nums[x]` years that have passed up to `start_year`.
  - Adding 1 to this quotient ensures we are looking at the next cycle.
  - Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the year at the start of the next cycle, which is the next occurrence of the sign.
- The program correctly updates `start_year` for each sign, ensuring that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
- The program handles multiple test cases as required.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the nth sign occurs and the apocalypse will happen. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
