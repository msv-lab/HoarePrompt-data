The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `num_tests`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The initial state includes `t` as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are given. The variable `num_tests` is introduced and assigned a value from the input, but the other variables (`t`, `n`, and the list of integers) remain unchanged by this snippet.

Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer input representing the number of test cases; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6.**
