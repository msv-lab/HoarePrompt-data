Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the logic for determining the year in which the n-th sign occurs. Specifically, the issue lies in the line `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This line attempts to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than `start_year`, but it does so incorrectly.

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
3
2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
9
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- The first sign occurs at year 2.
- The second sign must occur after year 2, so it occurs at year 3 (the next multiple of 3).
- The third sign must occur after year 3, so it occurs at year 4 (the next multiple of 4).

However, the program will output `8` for this test case because:
- After the first sign at year 2, it calculates the next multiple of 3 as `4` (which is correct).
- After the second sign at year 4, it calculates the next multiple of 4 as `8` (which is incorrect; it should be `6`, but since `4 // 4 + 1` is `2`, `2 * 4` is `8`).

To fix this, the program should correctly find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than `start_year`. Here is a corrected version of the loop:

```python
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            if start_year % nums[x] == 0:
                start_year += nums[x]
            else:
                start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)
```

This corrected version ensures that `start_year` is correctly updated to the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than the current `start_year`.
