Let's analyze the problem description, the program code, and the annotated version to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Description Recap:
- The Chaya tribe believes in n signs of the apocalypse.
- Each sign i occurs every a_i years.
- The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the (i+1)-th sign must occur strictly after the i-th sign.

### Program Code:
```python
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)
```

### Annotated Code:
- The program starts by reading the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the number of signs and their respective periodicities.
- It initializes `start_year` to 0.
- For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by finding the smallest multiple of the current sign's periodicity that is strictly greater than the current `start_year`.
- The formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is used to find this next occurrence year.
- Finally, it prints the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

### Original Assessment:
The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect because the line `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` does not correctly handle the logic for determining the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

### Detailed Analysis:
Let's examine the logic of the line `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`:

- `start_year // nums[x]` gives the integer division of `start_year` by `nums[x]`, which is the number of complete cycles of `nums[x]` that have occurred up to `start_year`.
- Adding 1 to this result gives the next cycle number.
- Multiplying by `nums[x]` then gives the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than `start_year`.

This logic is correct for finding the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than `start_year`. The original assessment's explanation of an incorrect calculation for the test case `1 3 2 3 4` is flawed because the program correctly calculates the next occurrence year for each sign.

### Verification with the Test Case:
Let's verify the program with the test case provided in the original assessment:

**Input:**
```
1
3
2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
9
```

**Program Execution:**
- `start_year` is initialized to 0.
- For the first sign (periodicity 2):
  - `start_year = (0 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`
- For the second sign (periodicity 3):
  - `start_year = (2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
- For the third sign (periodicity 4):
  - `start_year = (3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`
- The program prints `4`, but this is incorrect based on the problem statement. The correct sequence should be:
  - First sign at year 2.
  - Second sign at year 3 (next multiple of 3 after 2).
  - Third sign at year 9 (next multiple of 4 after 3).

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not handle the logic correctly. The corrected version of the program should indeed handle the case where `start_year` is already a multiple of `nums[x]` by adding `nums[x]` instead of recalculating the next multiple.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            if start_year % nums[x] == 0:
                start_year += nums[x]
            else:
                start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)
```

### Final Evaluation:
Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the logic for determining the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

**Final: False**
