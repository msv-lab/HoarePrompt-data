You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific year based on a list of integers provided. The input consists of the number of test cases, followed by the number of integers and the integers themselves for each test case. The output is the calculated year for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine the year in which the nth sign occurs, considering that each sign must occur sequentially. The ith sign occurs every a_i years, and the (i+1)th sign must occur strictly after the ith sign.

### Program Analysis:
The program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the number of signs, n.
   - It reads the list of periodicities, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
   - It initializes a variable `start_year` to 0.
   - It iterates through each sign's periodicity:
     - It calculates the next occurrence of the sign after the current `start_year` by using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
     - It updates `start_year` to this new value.
   - It prints the final `start_year` after processing all signs.

### Detailed Reasoning:
- The formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` correctly computes the next occurrence of the sign after `start_year`. This is because:
  - `start_year // nums[x]` gives the quotient of `start_year` divided by `nums[x]`, representing the number of complete cycles of `nums[x]` years that have passed up to `start_year`.
  - Adding 1 to this quotient ensures we are looking at the next cycle.
  - Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the year at the start of the next cycle, which is the next occurrence of the sign.
- The program correctly updates `start_year` for each sign, ensuring that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
- The program handles multiple test cases as required.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the nth sign occurs and the apocalypse will happen. Therefore, the program is correct.
