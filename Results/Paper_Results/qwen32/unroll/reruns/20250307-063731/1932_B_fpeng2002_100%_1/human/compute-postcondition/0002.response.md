To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's break down the provided code and understand the operations it performs for each test case.

### Code Explanation:
1. **Outer Loop (`while num_tests > 0`)**:
   - This loop runs `num_tests` times, where each iteration corresponds to one test case.

2. **Inner Operations (per test case)**:
   - **Input Reading**:
     - `n` is read as the number of integers in the current test case.
     - `nums` is read as a list of `n` integers.
   - **Logic**:
     - `start_year` is initialized to 0.
     - For each integer `nums[x]` in the list, `start_year` is updated using the formula:
       \[
       \text{start_year} = (\text{start_year} // \text{nums[x]} + 1) \times \text{nums[x]}
       \]
     - This formula ensures that `start_year` becomes the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than the current `start_year`.
   - **Output**:
     - After processing all elements in `nums`, the final value of `start_year` is printed.

### Output State:
- **`num_tests`**: After all iterations, `num_tests` will be 0 because the loop decrements `num_tests` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0.
- **`t`**: This variable is not modified within the loop and remains unchanged.
- **`n`** and **`nums`**: These variables are re-assigned in each iteration of the loop and do not retain their values after the loop completes.
- **`start_year`**: This variable is recalculated for each test case and is printed immediately after each test case, so it does not retain a specific value across all test cases.

### Conclusion:
The only variable that changes in a predictable way throughout the loop and retains a specific value at the end is `num_tests`, which will be 0 after all test cases have been processed.

Output State: **num_tests is 0, t remains unchanged, n and nums are not retained, start_year is not retained.**
