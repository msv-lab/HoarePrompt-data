Let's carefully analyze the provided program, the problem description, and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicity of each sign. The signs must occur sequentially, meaning each sign must occur strictly after the previous one.

### Program Code:
```python
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)
```

### Function Summary:
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific year based on a list of integers provided. The input consists of the number of test cases, followed by the number of integers and the integers themselves for each test case. The output is the calculated year for each test case.

### Original Assessment:
The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect due to the line `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. The assessment suggests that this line does not correctly find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than `start_year`.

### Analysis:
Let's examine the logic of the line `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`:

- `start_year // nums[x]` gives the integer division of `start_year` by `nums[x]`, which is the largest integer `k` such that `k * nums[x] <= start_year`.
- Adding 1 to this integer division result gives the next integer `k+1`.
- Multiplying `k+1` by `nums[x]` gives the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than `start_year`.

This logic is correct. The expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` indeed calculates the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than `start_year`.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the logic with the example provided in the original assessment:

**Input:**
```
1
3
2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
9
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- The first sign occurs at year 2.
- The second sign must occur after year 2, so it occurs at year 3 (the next multiple of 3).
- The third sign must occur after year 3, so it occurs at year 4 (the next multiple of 4).

Let's walk through the program's logic:
1. `start_year = 0`
2. For the first sign (`nums[0] = 2`):
   - `start_year = (0 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`
3. For the second sign (`nums[1] = 3`):
   - `start_year = (2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
4. For the third sign (`nums[2] = 4`):
   - `start_year = (3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`

The program output for this input is `4`, which is incorrect. However, the expected output `9` in the original assessment is also incorrect based on the problem description. The correct output should be `4` as per the problem's sequential occurrence rule.

### Corrected Expected Output:
The correct expected output for the input `1 3 2 3 4` is `4`, not `9`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly states that the program is wrong due to the logic of finding the next multiple. The logic in the program is correct, but the example provided in the original assessment has an incorrect expected output.

**Final: True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the logic implemented.
