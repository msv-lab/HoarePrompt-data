### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, based on the given periodicities of the signs.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic in the code:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign:**
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0, which represents the year from which the tribe starts waiting for the first sign.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur. This is done by finding the smallest multiple of the sign's periodicity that is strictly greater than the current `start_year`.
   - The formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` correctly computes the next occurrence year of the i-th sign after `start_year`. The division `start_year // nums[x]` gives the number of complete cycles of the sign's periodicity that have passed up to `start_year`. Adding 1 ensures that we move to the next cycle, and multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the next occurrence year.

3. **Updating `start_year`:**
   - After calculating the occurrence year of the current sign, `start_year` is updated to this new year.
   - This process is repeated for all signs in the sequence.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the final `start_year` is printed, which represents the year in which the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, based on the provided periodicities and the sequential requirement of the signs. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
