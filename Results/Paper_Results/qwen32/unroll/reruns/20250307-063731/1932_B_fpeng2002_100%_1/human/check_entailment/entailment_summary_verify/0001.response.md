### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program logic and the function summary in the context of the problem description.

#### Problem Analysis Recap:
1. **Input:**
   - Number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - Number of signs `n`.
     - List of periodicities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the year in which the nth sign occurs, ensuring each sign occurs sequentially after the previous one.

3. **Logic:**
   - For each test case, the program iteratively calculates the next occurrence of each sign, ensuring the next sign happens strictly after the previous one.

#### Program Analysis:
The program uses the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` to calculate the next occurrence of the sign after `start_year`. Let's break down this formula:
- `start_year // nums[x]` calculates how many complete cycles of `nums[x]` have passed up to `start_year`.
- Adding 1 ensures we are considering the next cycle.
- Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the first year of the next cycle, which is the next occurrence of the sign.

This logic correctly ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one. Here's the step-by-step verification:
1. **Initialization:** `start_year` is initialized to 0.
2. **Iteration:** For each sign, the program calculates the next occurrence using the formula and updates `start_year`.
3. **Output:** After processing all signs, the final `start_year` is printed as the year when the nth sign occurs.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary accurately describes the programâ€™s behavior: it processes multiple test cases and calculates the year based on the given periodicities, ensuring each sign occurs sequentially.

#### Example Verification:
Let's verify the first example test case:
- **Input:** `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
- **Steps:**
  - `start_year = 0`
  - After 1st sign: `(0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
  - After 2nd sign: `(3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
  - After 3rd sign: `(4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
  - After 4th sign: `(8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
  - After 5th sign: `(10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
  - After 6th sign: `(18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
- **Output:** `36`, which matches the expected result.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the year in which the nth sign occurs and the apocalypse will happen, adhering to the problem's requirements. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
