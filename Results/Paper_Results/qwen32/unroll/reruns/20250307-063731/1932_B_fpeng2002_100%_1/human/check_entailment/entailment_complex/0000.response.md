### Reasoning:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, based on the given periodicities of the signs.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program first reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs, `n`, and the list of periodicities, `nums`.

2. **Calculation for Each Test Case**:
   - The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0. This variable will keep track of the year when the current sign is expected to occur.
   - For each sign (in the loop), the program calculates the next occurrence year of the current sign based on the last occurrence year (`start_year`). The formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` correctly computes the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than `start_year`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the year when the n-th sign occurs, which is stored in `start_year`.

The logic is correct because:
- It ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
- It correctly calculates the next occurrence year for each sign based on its periodicity.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly solves the problem as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
