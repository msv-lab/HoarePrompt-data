The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `num_tests` is an integer input representing the number of test cases. To ensure that the loop executes at least once, `num_tests` needs to be greater than 0. Since `num_tests` is already described as an integer input, we need to ensure that it falls within the valid range specified (1 <= `num_tests` <= 1000).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `num_tests` is at least 1.

State: **`num_tests` is an integer such that 1 <= `num_tests` <= 1000, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6**
