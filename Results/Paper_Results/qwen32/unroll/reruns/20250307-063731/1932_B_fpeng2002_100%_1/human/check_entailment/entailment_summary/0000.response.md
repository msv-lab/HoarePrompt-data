### Reasoning:
The given Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, based on the provided problem description. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and the list of periodicities (`a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`).

2. **Calculation of the Year**:
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0, which represents the starting year for waiting for the first sign.
   - It iterates through each sign's periodicity. For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year as follows:
     - `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`
     - This formula ensures that `start_year` is updated to the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than the current `start_year`. This is exactly what is needed to wait for the next sign after the previous one has occurred.

3. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the `start_year`, which is the year when the n-th sign will occur.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **First Test Case**:
  - Input: `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
  - Calculation:
    - Start: `start_year = 0`
    - First sign: `start_year = (0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
    - Second sign: `start_year = (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
    - Third sign: `start_year = (4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
    - Fourth sign: `start_year = (8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
    - Fifth sign: `start_year = (10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
    - Sixth sign: `start_year = (18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
  - Output: `36` (matches the expected output)

- **Second Test Case**:
  - Input: `5`, `1 2 3 4 5`
  - Calculation:
    - Start: `start_year = 0`
    - First sign: `start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
    - Second sign: `start_year = (1 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`
    - Third sign: `start_year = (2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
    - Fourth sign: `start_year = (3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`
    - Fifth sign: `start_year = (4 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`
  - Output: `5` (matches the expected output)

- **Third Test Case**:
  - Input: `5`, `1 1 1 1 1`
  - Calculation:
    - Start: `start_year = 0`
    - All signs: `start_year` will be incremented by 1 in each step, resulting in `5` after the fifth sign.
  - Output: `5` (matches the expected output)

- **Fourth Test Case**:
  - Input: `6`, `50 30 711 200 503 1006`
  - Calculation:
    - Start: `start_year = 0`
    - First sign: `start_year = (0 // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`
    - Second sign: `start_year = (50 // 30 + 1) * 30 = 60`
    - Third sign: `start_year = (60 // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`
    - Fourth sign: `start_year = (711 // 200 + 1) * 200 = 900`
    - Fifth sign: `start_year = (900 // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`
    - Sixth sign: `start_year = (1006 // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`
  - Output: `2012` (matches the expected output)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur for each test case, as verified by the example inputs and outputs.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
