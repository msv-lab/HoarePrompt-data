### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided code to ensure that the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine the year in which the nth sign occurs, considering that each sign must occur sequentially. Specifically:
- The i-th sign occurs every `a_i` years.
- The (i+1)-th sign must occur strictly after the i-th sign.

#### Program Analysis:
The program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the number of signs, `n`.
   - It reads the list of periodicities, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
   - It initializes a variable `start_year` to 0.
   - It iterates through each sign's periodicity:
     - It calculates the next occurrence of the sign after the current `start_year` using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
     - It updates `start_year` to this new value.
   - It prints the final `start_year` after processing all signs.

#### Detailed Reasoning:
- The formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` correctly computes the next occurrence of the sign after `start_year`. Here's why:
  - `start_year // nums[x]` gives the number of complete cycles of `nums[x]` years that have passed up to `start_year`.
  - Adding 1 to this quotient ensures we are looking at the next cycle.
  - Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the year at the start of the next cycle, which is the next occurrence of the sign.
- The program correctly updates `start_year` for each sign, ensuring that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
- The program handles multiple test cases as required.

#### Annotations:
The annotations provided describe the state of the program at key points:
- Before the function call, `num_tests` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), and `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^6\).
- After processing all test cases, `num_tests` is 0, and `n` and `nums` are not retained, while `start_year` is not retained.

#### Validation:
The annotations and the detailed reasoning align with the problem requirements and the provided code. The formula used to calculate the next occurrence of each sign is correct and ensures that each subsequent sign occurs strictly after the previous one.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the nth sign occurs and the apocalypse will happen. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final:** **True**
