Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code has a few issues that may lead to incorrect results for certain cases.

1. **Global Variable Usage**:
   - The function `check(A)` uses a global variable `g` which is defined in `func_1(n, k, edges)`. This is not a good practice and can lead to issues if `func_1` is called multiple times with different graphs.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases such as when `k` is very close to `n` or when the tree is very unbalanced. For example, if `k` is `n-1`, the code should return `1` because removing `n-1` edges will result in `n` components, each with one vertex.

3. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search logic in `func_1` is mostly correct, but the `check(A)` function might not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, the condition `if r > k or (d[1] >= A and r == k):` might not cover all scenarios correctly. For instance, if the sum of the sizes of the components is exactly `k` and each component is of size `A`, the function should return `True`.

4. **Visited Set Handling**:
   - The `visited` set and dictionary `d` are not cleared between different calls to `check(A)`. This could lead to incorrect results if `check(A)` is called multiple times within the same `func_1` call.

5. **Component Size Calculation**:
   - The way component sizes are calculated and updated in `check(A)` might not be correct for all tree structures. The code should ensure that each component size is correctly counted and that the conditions for removing `k` edges are met.

### Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```
1
6 2
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
```
The correct output should be `2`. However, the provided code might not handle this case correctly due to the issues mentioned above.

### Corrected Code (Conceptual):
To correct the code, we need to ensure that the `check(A)` function correctly handles all cases and that the global variable `g` is not used. Additionally, the `visited` set and dictionary `d` should be cleared between different calls to `check(A)`.

Here is a conceptual correction:
```python
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        g[b].append(a)

    def check(A, g):
        stack = [(1, 1)]
        visited = set()
        d = {1: 1}
        r = 0
        while True:
            (x, p) = stack[-1]
            if x not in visited:
                visited.add(x)
                d[x] = 1
                for node in g[x]:
                    if node != p:
                        stack.append((node, x))
            else:
                if x == 1:
                    break
                if d[x] >= A:
                    r += 1
                else:
                    d[p] += d[x]
                stack.pop()
                visited.remove(x)
                del d[x]
        return r <= k and (d[1] < A or r == k)

    l = 1
    r = n // k
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        if check(mid, g):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
    return r

# Example usage:
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    edges = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n - 1)]
    results.append(func_1(n, k, edges))

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected version ensures that `check(A)` is correctly implemented and that the global variable `g` is not used. The `visited` set and dictionary `d` are also cleared between different calls to `check(A)`.
