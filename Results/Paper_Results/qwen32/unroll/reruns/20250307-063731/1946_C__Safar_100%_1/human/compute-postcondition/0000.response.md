Output State: **A is a positive integer, g is an adjacency list representing the tree with n vertices, and k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n; stack is [(1, 1)]**

The variable `stack` has been initialized to contain a single tuple `(1, 1)`. All other variables (`A`, `g`, and `k`) retain their initial values.
