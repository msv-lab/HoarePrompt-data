The code snippet assigns a dictionary `d` with the key `1` and the value `1`. This dictionary `d` is newly introduced and does not affect the values of `A`, `g`, `k`, `stack`, or `visited`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the dictionary `d`.

Output State: **A is a positive integer, g is an adjacency list representing the tree with n vertices, and k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n; stack is [(1, 1)]; visited is an empty set; d is {(1): 1}**.
