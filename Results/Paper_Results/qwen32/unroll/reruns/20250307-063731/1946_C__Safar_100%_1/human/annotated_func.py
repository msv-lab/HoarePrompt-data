#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, k is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge connecting vertices a and b in the tree.

    for (a, b) in edges:

        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, and `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge connecting vertices a and b in the tree; `g` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `i` contains all vertices directly connected to vertex `i` by an edge in `edges`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of vertices in a tree; `k`, an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n; and `edges`, a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge connecting vertices a and b in the tree. The function constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree and then performs a binary search to determine a value `r`. The function prints the value of `r` at the end.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: A is a positive integer, g is an adjacency list representing the tree with n vertices, and k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n.

    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `check` determines whether a specific condition is met in a tree structure represented by an adjacency list `g` with `n` vertices. It returns `True` if the number of subtrees where the sum of node values is at least `A` is greater than `k`, or if this number is exactly `k` and the sum of node values of the entire tree is at least `A`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
