### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries to determine if the program is correct.

1. **Global Variable Usage**:
   - The function `check(A)` uses a global variable `g` which is defined in `func_1(n, k, edges)`. This is indeed not good practice, as it can lead to issues if `func_1` is called multiple times with different graphs. However, in this specific context, `g` is defined and used correctly within the same scope of `func_1`, and it is not reused across different calls to `func_1`. This is a potential issue if the function were to be used in a different context, but it is not a flaw in the current implementation.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The code does not explicitly handle cases where `k` is very close to `n` or when the tree is very unbalanced. However, the binary search approach should theoretically cover these cases by adjusting the range of possible values for `x` (from 1 to `n // k`).

3. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search logic in `func_1` is correct. It searches for the maximum `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges and each remaining component has at least `x` vertices.
   - The `check(A)` function's logic is designed to verify if it is possible to partition the tree into components of size at least `A` after removing exactly `k` edges. The condition `if r > k or (d[1] >= A and r == k):` ensures that either the number of components is less than or equal to `k` and the size of the root component is less than `A`, or the number of components is exactly `k` and the size of the root component is at least `A`.

4. **Visited Set Handling**:
   - The `visited` set and dictionary `d` are correctly managed within the `check(A)` function. They are initialized at the start of each call to `check(A)` and are not reused across different calls.

5. **Component Size Calculation**:
   - The way component sizes are calculated and updated in `check(A)` is correct. The function uses a depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree, calculate the size of each subtree, and count the number of components that meet the size requirement.

### Example Case:
Let's verify the provided example:
```
1
6 2
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
```
- The correct output should be `2`.
- The binary search will test different values of `x` (from 1 to 3).
- For `x = 2`, `check(2)` will return `True` because it is possible to remove 2 edges and have each remaining component with at least 2 vertices (e.g., removing edges (1,2) and (4,5) results in components {1,2}, {3,4,5,6}).
- For `x = 3`, `check(3)` will return `False` because it is not possible to remove 2 edges and have each remaining component with at least 3 vertices.
- Therefore, the binary search will correctly identify `x = 2` as the maximum value.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least `x`. The function summaries and the code logic align with the problem description and the example case.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
