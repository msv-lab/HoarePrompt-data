### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The task is to find the maximum number `x` such that, after removing exactly `k` edges from a given tree, all remaining connected components have at least `x` vertices.
   - The tree is represented by `n` vertices and `n-1` edges.

2. **Approach Analysis:**
   - The program uses a binary search on the possible values of `x` to determine the maximum valid `x` that satisfies the condition.
   - The binary search runs from `1` to `n // k` because the maximum possible size of each component after removing `k` edges cannot be greater than `n // k`.
   - For each midpoint value `mid` in the binary search, the `check(mid)` function is called to verify if it is possible to split the tree into components where each component has at least `mid` vertices by removing exactly `k` edges.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1` constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree using the provided edges.
   - It then performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition by calling `check(mid)` for each midpoint `mid`.
   - The function prints the result `r`, which is the maximum valid `x`.

4. **Function `check` Analysis:**
   - `check(A)` uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the tree.
   - It keeps track of the size of each subtree using a dictionary `d`.
   - If a subtree has a size of at least `A`, it increments the count `r` of such subtrees.
   - The function returns `True` if the number of such subtrees is greater than `k` or if it is exactly `k` and the entire tree has a size of at least `A`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The binary search in `func_1` ensures that the program efficiently finds the maximum valid `x`.
   - The `check` function correctly implements the logic to verify if a given `x` is achievable by removing exactly `k` edges.
   - The adjacency list representation is a standard and efficient way to represent a tree for DFS traversal.

Based on the provided code and the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.
