The function `check` determines whether a specific condition is met in a tree structure represented by an adjacency list `g` with `n` vertices. It returns `True` if the number of subtrees where the sum of node values is at least `A` is greater than `k`, or if this number is exactly `k` and the sum of node values of the entire tree is at least `A`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
