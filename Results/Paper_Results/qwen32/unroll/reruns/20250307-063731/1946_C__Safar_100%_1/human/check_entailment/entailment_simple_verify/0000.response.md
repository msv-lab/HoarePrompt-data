### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotations to determine the correctness of the program.

#### 1. Global Variable Usage:
The function `check(A)` uses the global variable `g`, which is defined in `func_1(n, k, edges)`. This is indeed a poor practice because it can lead to issues if `func_1` is called multiple times with different graphs. However, in the context of this problem, the function `func_1` is called once per test case, and the adjacency list `g` is redefined for each test case, so this specific issue does not cause incorrect results in the given context. Nonetheless, it is a good practice to avoid global variables for clarity and maintainability.

#### 2. Edge Case Handling:
The code does not explicitly handle the edge case where `k` is very close to `n` or when the tree is very unbalanced. However, the binary search logic and the `check(A)` function are designed to handle these cases. The `check(A)` function ensures that the number of components `r` is not greater than `k` and that if `r` equals `k`, the size of the root component `d[1]` is at least `A`. This logic should cover the edge cases properly.

#### 3. Binary Search Logic:
The binary search logic in `func_1` is correct. It searches for the maximum possible size `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges and ensure that each remaining component has at least `x` vertices. The `check(A)` function is used to verify if a given size `A` is feasible.

#### 4. Visited Set Handling:
The `visited` set and dictionary `d` are used correctly within the `check(A)` function. They are initialized at the start of each call to `check(A)` and are not shared between different calls, ensuring that the function works correctly for each test case.

#### 5. Component Size Calculation:
The way component sizes are calculated and updated in `check(A)` is correct. The function uses a depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree and calculate the size of each component. It ensures that each component size is correctly counted and that the conditions for removing `k` edges are met.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
The annotations provided give a good understanding of the program's state at key points. The annotations indicate that the program correctly sets up the adjacency list `g` and performs a binary search to find the maximum possible size `x`. The `check(A)` function correctly uses a DFS to traverse the tree and calculate the size of each component.

### Example Case:
The example case provided in the original assessment is handled correctly by the code. For the input:
```
1
6 2
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
```
The correct output is `2`, and the code correctly outputs `2`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code, despite some issues with global variable usage, correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least `x`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
