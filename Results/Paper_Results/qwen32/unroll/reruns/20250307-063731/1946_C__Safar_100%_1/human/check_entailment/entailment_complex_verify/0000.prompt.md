You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/799bacd3be0dda357800fdfc3eadbf38ab259c51.png)

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of vertices in a tree; `k`, an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n; and `edges`, a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge connecting vertices a and b in the tree. The function constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree and then performs a binary search to determine a value `r`. The function prints the value of `r` at the end.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: A is a positive integer, g is an adjacency list representing the tree with n vertices, and k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n.

    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `check` determines whether a specific condition is met in a tree structure represented by an adjacency list `g` with `n` vertices. It returns `True` if the number of subtrees where the sum of node values is at least `A` is greater than `k`, or if this number is exactly `k` and the sum of node values of the entire tree is at least `A`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code has a few issues that may lead to incorrect results for certain cases.

1. **Global Variable Usage**:
   - The function `check(A)` uses a global variable `g` which is defined in `func_1(n, k, edges)`. This is not a good practice and can lead to issues if `func_1` is called multiple times with different graphs.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases such as when `k` is very close to `n` or when the tree is very unbalanced. For example, if `k` is `n-1`, the code should return `1` because removing `n-1` edges will result in `n` components, each with one vertex.

3. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search logic in `func_1` is mostly correct, but the `check(A)` function might not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, the condition `if r > k or (d[1] >= A and r == k):` might not cover all scenarios correctly. For instance, if the sum of the sizes of the components is exactly `k` and each component is of size `A`, the function should return `True`.

4. **Visited Set Handling**:
   - The `visited` set and dictionary `d` are not cleared between different calls to `check(A)`. This could lead to incorrect results if `check(A)` is called multiple times within the same `func_1` call.

5. **Component Size Calculation**:
   - The way component sizes are calculated and updated in `check(A)` might not be correct for all tree structures. The code should ensure that each component size is correctly counted and that the conditions for removing `k` edges are met.

### Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```
1
6 2
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
```
The correct output should be `2`. However, the provided code might not handle this case correctly due to the issues mentioned above.

### Corrected Code (Conceptual):
To correct the code, we need to ensure that the `check(A)` function correctly handles all cases and that the global variable `g` is not used. Additionally, the `visited` set and dictionary `d` should be cleared between different calls to `check(A)`.

Here is a conceptual correction:
```python
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        g[b].append(a)

    def check(A, g):
        stack = [(1, 1)]
        visited = set()
        d = {1: 1}
        r = 0
        while True:
            (x, p) = stack[-1]
            if x not in visited:
                visited.add(x)
                d[x] = 1
                for node in g[x]:
                    if node != p:
                        stack.append((node, x))
            else:
                if x == 1:
                    break
                if d[x] >= A:
                    r += 1
                else:
                    d[p] += d[x]
                stack.pop()
                visited.remove(x)
                del d[x]
        return r <= k and (d[1] < A or r == k)

    l = 1
    r = n // k
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        if check(mid, g):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
    return r

# Example usage:
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    edges = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n - 1)]
    results.append(func_1(n, k, edges))

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected version ensures that `check(A)` is correctly implemented and that the global variable `g` is not used. The `visited` set and dictionary `d` are also cleared between different calls to `check(A)`.
