The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of vertices in a tree; `k`, an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n; and `edges`, a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge connecting vertices a and b in the tree. The function constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree and then performs a binary search to determine a value `r`. The function prints the value of `r` at the end.
