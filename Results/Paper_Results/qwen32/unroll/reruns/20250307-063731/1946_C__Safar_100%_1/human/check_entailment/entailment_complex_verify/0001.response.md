### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to determine the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Breakdown

The problem requires finding the maximum number `x` such that, after removing exactly `k` edges from a tree, each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.

#### Program Analysis

The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(n, k, edges)`: This function sets up the graph and uses binary search to find the maximum `x`.
2. `check(A)`: This function checks if it's possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `A` vertices.

#### Detailed Analysis

#### Function `func_1(n, k, edges)`

- **Graph Construction**: The graph `g` is constructed using an adjacency list representation.
- **Binary Search**: The function performs a binary search on the possible values of `x` (from `1` to `n // k`) to find the maximum value that satisfies the condition.

#### Function `check(A)`

- **DFS Traversal**: The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from node `1` to explore the tree.
- **Component Counting**: During the DFS, it counts the size of each connected component. If a component size is at least `A`, it increments the count of such components (`r`).
- **Edge Removal Check**: After the DFS, it checks if the number of components (`r`) is exactly `k` and the size of the root component is at least `A`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Global Variable `g`**:
   - The graph `g` is defined inside `func_1` but used inside `check(A)`. This is incorrect because `check(A)` does not have access to `g` unless it is passed as an argument or defined globally. The annotations mention that `g` is used in `check(A)` but do not indicate that it is passed as an argument, which is necessary for `check(A)` to access it.

2. **Edge Count Condition**:
   - The condition `if r > k or (d[1] >= A and r == k):` is incorrect. The correct condition should be `if r == k and d[1] >= A` because we need exactly `k` components, not more or less. The annotations correctly identify this issue.

### Correctness

Given the issues mentioned above, the program is incorrect as it stands. The graph `g` needs to be passed as an argument to `check(A)`, and the edge count condition needs to be corrected.

### Conclusion

The original assessment correctly identifies the issues with the program. The graph `g` should be passed to `check(A)`, and the condition for checking the number of components should be corrected.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
