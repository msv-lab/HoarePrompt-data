You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of vertices in a tree; `k`, an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n; and `edges`, a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge connecting vertices a and b in the tree. The function constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree and then performs a binary search to determine a value `r`. The function prints the value of `r` at the end.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: A is a positive integer, g is an adjacency list representing the tree with n vertices, and k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n.

    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `check` determines whether a specific condition is met in a tree structure represented by an adjacency list `g` with `n` vertices. It returns `True` if the number of subtrees where the sum of node values is at least `A` is greater than `k`, or if this number is exactly `k` and the sum of node values of the entire tree is at least `A`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown

The problem involves finding the maximum number `x` such that, after removing exactly `k` edges from a tree, each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.

### Program Analysis

The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(n, k, edges)`: This function sets up the graph and uses binary search to find the maximum `x`.
2. `check(A)`: This function checks if it's possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `A` vertices.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Function `func_1(n, k, edges)`

- **Graph Construction**: The graph is constructed using an adjacency list representation.
- **Binary Search**: The function performs a binary search on the possible values of `x` (from `1` to `n // k`) to find the maximum value that satisfies the condition.

#### Function `check(A)`

- **DFS Traversal**: The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from node `1` to explore the tree.
- **Component Counting**: During the DFS, it counts the size of each connected component. If a component size is at least `A`, it increments the count of such components (`r`).
- **Edge Removal Check**: After the DFS, it checks if the number of components (`r`) is greater than `k` or if the root component size is at least `A` and the number of components is exactly `k`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Global Variable `g`**: The graph `g` is defined inside `func_1` but used inside `check(A)`. This is incorrect because `check(A)` does not have access to `g` unless it is passed as an argument or defined globally.
2. **Edge Count Condition**: The condition `if r > k or (d[1] >= A and r == k):` is incorrect. The correct condition should be `if r == k and d[1] >= A` because we need exactly `k` components, not more or less.

### Correctness

Given the issues mentioned above, the program is incorrect as it stands. The graph `g` needs to be passed as an argument to `check(A)`, and the edge count condition needs to be corrected.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
