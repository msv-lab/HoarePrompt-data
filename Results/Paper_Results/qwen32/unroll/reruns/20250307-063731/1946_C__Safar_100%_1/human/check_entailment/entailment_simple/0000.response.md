### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided program to understand its logic and correctness.

1. **Main Loop and Input Reading:**
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of vertices), `k` (number of edges to be removed), and the list of edges.
   - Instead of processing each test case immediately, it appends the test case details to a list `q`.
   - After all test cases are read, it iterates through `q` and calls `func_1` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1(n, k, edges)`:**
   - This function constructs an adjacency list `g` from the edges.
   - It initializes binary search bounds `l` and `r` to find the maximum possible size `x` of the remaining connected components.
   - It performs a binary search on `x` using the `check` function to determine if it's possible to split the tree into connected components of at least size `x` by removing `k` edges.
   - It prints the maximum `x` found.

3. **Function `check(A)`:**
   - This function performs a DFS to count the sizes of connected components in the tree.
   - It uses a stack to traverse the tree and a dictionary `d` to keep track of the sizes of subtrees.
   - It checks if it's possible to split the tree into `k` or fewer connected components, each of size at least `A`.

### Issues in the Program:

- **Uninitialized `g` in `check` Function:**
  - The adjacency list `g` is defined in `func_1`, but it is not passed to `check`. Therefore, `check` does not have access to `g` and will raise a `NameError`.

- **Incorrect State of `r` in `func_1`:**
  - The variable `r` is correctly defined and updated in `func_1`, but the comment `#This is printed: NameError: name 'r' is not defined` is incorrect because `r` is defined and accessible in the `print(r)` statement.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, the program will not execute correctly due to the `NameError` caused by the use of an undefined variable `g` in the `check` function. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
