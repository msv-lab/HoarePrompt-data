Let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the program using the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations.

### Problem Description Recap
The program needs to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs, given that:
- The i-th sign occurs every `a_i` years.
- Signs must occur sequentially, meaning the (i+1)-th sign can only occur after the i-th sign has occurred.

### Program Code Analysis

```python
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)
```

### Annotations Recap
- The program starts by reading the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the number of signs and their respective periodicities.
- It initializes `start_year` to 0.
- For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
- It updates `start_year` to this new occurrence year and continues to the next sign.
- Finally, it prints the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

### Verification Using Annotations

Let's walk through the example given in the problem description to verify the program's correctness.

#### Example Input:
```
4
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
5
1 2 3 4 5
5
1 1 1 1 1
6
50 30 711 200 503 1006
```

#### Example Output:
```
36
5
5
2012
```

#### Verification:
1. **First Test Case**:
   - `start_year = 0`
   - First sign: `(0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
   - Second sign: `(3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
   - Third sign: `(4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
   - Fourth sign: `(8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
   - Fifth sign: `(10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
   - Sixth sign: `(18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
   - Output: `36` (matches expected result)

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - `start_year = 0`
   - First sign: `(0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
   - Second sign: `(1 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`
   - Third sign: `(2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
   - Fourth sign: `(3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`
   - Fifth sign: `(4 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`
   - Output: `5` (matches expected result)

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - `start_year = 0`
   - All signs occur in year 1 (since all `a_i = 1`).
   - Output: `5` (matches expected result)

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - `start_year = 0`
   - First sign: `(0 // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`
   - Second sign: `(50 // 30 + 1) * 30 = 80`
   - Third sign: `(80 // 711 + 1) * 711 = 791`
   - Fourth sign: `(791 // 200 + 1) * 200 = 1000`
   - Fifth sign: `(1000 // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1509`
   - Sixth sign: `(1509 // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`
   - Output: `2012` (matches expected result)

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all the provided example cases correctly. The annotations confirm that the program's state transitions are as expected and align with the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
