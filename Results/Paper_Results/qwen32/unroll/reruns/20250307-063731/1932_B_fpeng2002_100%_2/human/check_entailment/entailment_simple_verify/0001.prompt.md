You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the reasoning step by step to determine if the given Python program correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
- We have `n` signs, each occurring every `a_i` years.
- The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the next sign can only occur after the previous one.
- We need to find the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a_i`.

2. **Logic to Find the Year**:
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0, which represents the year we start counting from.
   - For each sign, it updates `start_year` to the next occurrence of the current sign.
   - The formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is used to find the next occurrence of the sign after the `start_year`.

### Detailed Explanation of the Formula:
- `start_year // nums[x]` gives the number of full cycles of the current sign that have occurred up to `start_year`.
- Adding 1 ensures we are considering the next cycle.
- Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the next occurrence of the sign.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's go through the first example given in the problem:
- For `n = 6` and `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`:
  - Start with `start_year = 0`.
  - For the first sign (`a_1 = 3`), the next occurrence is `(0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`.
  - For the second sign (`a_2 = 2`), the next occurrence after year 3 is `(3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`.
  - For the third sign (`a_3 = 4`), the next occurrence after year 4 is `(4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`.
  - For the fourth sign (`a_4 = 5`), the next occurrence after year 8 is `(8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`.
  - For the fifth sign (`a_5 = 9`), the next occurrence after year 10 is `(10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`.
  - For the sixth sign (`a_6 = 18`), the next occurrence after year 18 is `(18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`.

The program correctly computes `36` as the year for the sixth sign to occur, which matches the example output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs, following the sequential requirement of the problem.
