Reasoning:  
The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen based on the given conditions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Input Reading:** The program first reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. **Initialization:** It initializes `start_year` to 0. This variable keeps track of the year in which the current sign is expected to occur.

3. **Calculation of Occurrence Year:**
   - For each sign (from the first to the n-th), the program calculates the next occurrence year as follows:
     - `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`
     - This formula calculates the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than `start_year`. This ensures that the i-th sign occurs strictly after the (i-1)-th sign.

4. **Output:** After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the final `start_year`, which is the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

The logic of the program aligns perfectly with the problem statement. For each sign, it waits for the next occurrence strictly after the previous sign, and it correctly computes the year when the last sign will occur.

Correctness: **True**
