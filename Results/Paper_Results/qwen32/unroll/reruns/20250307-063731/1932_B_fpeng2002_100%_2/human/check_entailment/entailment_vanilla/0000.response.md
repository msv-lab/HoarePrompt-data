Let's break down the reasoning step by step to determine if the given Python program correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
- We have `n` signs, each occurring every `a_i` years.
- The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the next sign can only occur after the previous one.
- We need to find the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a_i`.

2. **Logic to Find the Year**:
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0, which represents the year we start counting from.
   - For each sign, it updates `start_year` to the next occurrence of the current sign.
   - The formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is used to find the next occurrence of the sign after the `start_year`.

### Detailed Explanation of the Formula:
- `start_year // nums[x]` gives the number of full cycles of the current sign that have occurred up to `start_year`.
- Adding 1 ensures we are considering the next cycle.
- Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the next occurrence of the sign.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's go through the first example given in the problem:
- For `n = 6` and `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`:
  - Start with `start_year = 0`.
  - For the first sign (`a_1 = 3`), the next occurrence is `(0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`.
  - For the second sign (`a_2 = 2`), the next occurrence after year 3 is `(3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`.
  - For the third sign (`a_3 = 4`), the next occurrence after year 4 is `(4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`.
  - For the fourth sign (`a_4 = 5`), the next occurrence after year 8 is `(8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`.
  - For the fifth sign (`a_5 = 9`), the next occurrence after year 10 is `(10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`.
  - For the sixth sign (`a_6 = 18`), the next occurrence after year 18 is `(18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`.

The program correctly computes `36` as the year for the sixth sign to occur, which matches the example output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs, following the sequential requirement of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
