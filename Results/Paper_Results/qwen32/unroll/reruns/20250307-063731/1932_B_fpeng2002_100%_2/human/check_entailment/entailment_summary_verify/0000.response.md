Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Description Recap:
- There are `n` signs of the apocalypse, each occurring every `a_i` years.
- The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the i-th sign must occur strictly after the (i-1)-th sign.
- We need to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

### Provided Code:
```python
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)
```

### Function Summary:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it calculates and prints the smallest year that is a multiple of all integers in the list.

### Original Assessment:
The original assessment claims that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It explains the steps taken by the program and concludes that the logic correctly ensures each sign occurs strictly after the previous one.

### Analysis:
Let's break down the program logic and verify if it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization**: `start_year` is initialized to 0, which is correct as we start waiting from year 0.
2. **Loop through Signs**: For each sign's periodicity `a_i`:
   - The expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` calculates the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than `start_year`.
   - This ensures that each subsequent sign occurs strictly after the previous one, as required.
3. **Output**: After processing all signs, `start_year` will hold the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the first test case from the example:

- **Input**: `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
- **Processing**:
  - `start_year = 0`
  - First sign: `(0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
  - Second sign: `(3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
  - Third sign: `(4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
  - Fourth sign: `(8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
  - Fifth sign: `(10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
  - Sixth sign: `(18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
- **Output**: `36`

The output matches the expected result for the first test case. Similarly, the program should work correctly for other test cases.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse will happen, based on the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
