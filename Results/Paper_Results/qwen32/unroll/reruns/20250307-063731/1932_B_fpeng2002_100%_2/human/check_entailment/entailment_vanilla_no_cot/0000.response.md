Let's analyze the provided Python code and determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

The task is to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given that each sign occurs periodically and must occur sequentially. The code provided implements this logic by iterating through each sign, calculating the next occurrence year based on the previous sign's occurrence year and the current sign's periodicity.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. `num_tests = int(input())`: Reads the number of test cases.
2. `while num_tests > 0`: Loops through each test case.
3. `num_tests -= 1`: Decrements the number of test cases left to process.
4. `n = int(input())`: Reads the number of signs for the current test case.
5. `nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]`: Reads the periodicities of the signs.
6. `start_year = 0`: Initializes the starting year as 0.
7. `for x in range(0, len(nums))`: Loops through each sign.
8. `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`: Calculates the next occurrence year for the current sign. This formula works by finding the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than `start_year`.
9. `print(start_year)`: Outputs the year in which the n-th sign will occur.

The logic in the code correctly implements the problem's requirements. For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year based on the previous sign's occurrence year and the current sign's periodicity, ensuring that the signs occur sequentially.

Thus, the provided code is correct.
