Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`) and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
    - It reads the number of signs (`n`).
    - It reads the list of periodicities (`nums`).
    - It initializes `start_year` to 0, which represents the year from which the waiting for the next sign starts.
    - For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by finding the smallest multiple of the current sign's periodicity that is greater than the `start_year`.
    - This is achieved by the expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, which effectively finds the next multiple of `nums[x]` after `start_year`.
    - It updates `start_year` to this next occurrence year and continues to the next sign.
3. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, it prints the final `start_year`, which is the year in which the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse will happen.

The logic correctly ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one, as required by the problem description. The program handles the provided example cases correctly, and there are no apparent edge cases that would cause it to fail based on the given constraints.

Thus, the program is correct.
