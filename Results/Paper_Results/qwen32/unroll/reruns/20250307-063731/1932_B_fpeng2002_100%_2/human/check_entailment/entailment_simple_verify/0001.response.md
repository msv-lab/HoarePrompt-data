### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies the logic and reasoning behind the program. Let's systematically verify the program using the annotations and the provided examples.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and the list of periodicities (`nums`).

2. **Logic to Find the Year**:
   - The program initializes `start_year` to 0, representing the starting year.
   - For each sign, it updates `start_year` to the next occurrence of the current sign using the formula: `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
   - This formula ensures that `start_year` is updated to the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than the current `start_year`.

3. **Detailed Explanation of the Formula**:
   - `start_year // nums[x]` gives the number of complete cycles of the current sign that have occurred up to `start_year`.
   - Adding 1 ensures we move to the next cycle.
   - Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the year of the next occurrence of the sign.

4. **Example Walkthrough**:
   - For the first example with `n = 6` and `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`:
     - Start with `start_year = 0`.
     - For the first sign (`a_1 = 3`), the next occurrence is `(0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`.
     - For the second sign (`a_2 = 2`), the next occurrence after year 3 is `(3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`.
     - For the third sign (`a_3 = 4`), the next occurrence after year 4 is `(4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`.
     - For the fourth sign (`a_4 = 5`), the next occurrence after year 8 is `(8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`.
     - For the fifth sign (`a_5 = 9`), the next occurrence after year 10 is `(10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`.
     - For the sixth sign (`a_6 = 18`), the next occurrence after year 18 is `(18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`.
   - The program correctly computes `36` as the year for the sixth sign to occur, matching the example output.

5. **Additional Examples**:
   - For `n = 5` and `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the program computes `5` as the year for the fifth sign to occur, matching the example output.
   - For `n = 5` and `nums = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, the program computes `5` as the year for the fifth sign to occur, matching the example output.
   - For `n = 6` and `nums = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`, the program computes `2012` as the year for the sixth sign to occur, matching the example output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs, following the sequential requirement of the problem. The annotations and the detailed walkthrough confirm that the program behaves as expected.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
