### Reasoning:
The program is designed to find the year in which the n-th sign occurs, given that each sign must occur sequentially and each sign occurs every a_i years. The logic of the program is to iteratively calculate the next occurrence of each sign after the previous one.

Let's break down the logic again using the annotated code and the problem description:

1. **Initialization**: `start_year` is initialized to 0, representing the starting point before any signs have occurred.
2. **Iterative Calculation**: For each sign, the program calculates the next occurrence using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`:
   - `start_year // nums[x]` gives the number of full cycles of the current sign that have occurred up to `start_year`.
   - Adding 1 ensures we are considering the next cycle.
   - Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the next occurrence of the sign.
3. **Sequential Occurrence**: The `start_year` is updated to the next occurrence of the current sign, and this new `start_year` is used to calculate the next sign's occurrence. This ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one.

Let's validate the logic with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 6`, `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - `start_year = 0`
  - First sign (`a_1 = 3`): `(0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
  - Second sign (`a_2 = 2`): `(3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
  - Third sign (`a_3 = 4`): `(4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
  - Fourth sign (`a_4 = 5`): `(8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
  - Fifth sign (`a_5 = 9`): `(10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
  - Sixth sign (`a_6 = 18`): `(18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
  
The output for this test case is `36`, which matches the expected result.

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs, following the sequential requirement of the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
