### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given that each sign appears every `a_i` years and must occur sequentially. The provided program reads multiple test cases, where for each test case, it calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on the given periodicities.

Let's break down the program logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign:**
   - The program initializes `start_year` to 0.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by finding the smallest multiple of the current sign's periodicity `a_i` that is greater than the current `start_year`. This is done using the formula:
     ```python
     start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
     ```
   - This formula ensures that `start_year` is updated to the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than the current `start_year`.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the `start_year`, which represents the year in which the n-th sign will occur.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - `n = 6`, `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
   - Initial `start_year = 0`
   - After processing each sign:
     - `start_year = (0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
     - `start_year = (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
     - `start_year = (4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
     - `start_year = (8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
     - `start_year = (10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
     - `start_year = (18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
   - The output is `36`, which matches the expected result.

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`, `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - Initial `start_year = 0`
   - After processing each sign:
     - `start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
     - `start_year = (1 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`
     - `start_year = (2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
     - `start_year = (3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`
     - `start_year = (4 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`
   - The output is `5`, which matches the expected result.

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - Initial `start_year = 0`
   - After processing each sign:
     - `start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
     - `start_year = (1 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2`
     - `start_year = (2 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 3`
     - `start_year = (3 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 4`
     - `start_year = (4 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 5`
   - The output is `5`, which matches the expected result.

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - `n = 6`, `a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
   - Initial `start_year = 0`
   - After processing each sign:
     - `start_year = (0 // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`
     - `start_year = (50 // 30 + 1) * 30 = 60`
     - `start_year = (60 // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`
     - `start_year = (711 // 200 + 1) * 200 = 900`
     - `start_year = (900 // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`
     - `start_year = (1006 // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`
   - The output is `2012`, which matches the expected result.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur for each test case based on the given periodicities. Therefore, the program is correct.
