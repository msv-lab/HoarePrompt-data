To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `num_tests > 0` is satisfied. The only variable in the loop head that we can adjust is `num_tests`.

Given the state right before the `while` loop, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `num_tests` is an input integer. To guarantee that the loop can execute at least once, `num_tests` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, we need to adjust `num_tests` to be greater than 0. Since `num_tests` is an input integer, we can state that it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` must be greater than 0**
