Let's analyze the problem, the provided code, and the function summary to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Recap:
- We have `n` signs, each occurring every `a_i` years.
- The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the next sign can only occur after the previous one.
- We need to find the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a_i`.

2. **Logic to Find the Year**:
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0, which represents the year we start counting from.
   - For each sign, it updates `start_year` to the next occurrence of the current sign.
   - The formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is used to find the next occurrence of the sign after the `start_year`.

### Detailed Explanation of the Formula:
- `start_year // nums[x]` gives the number of full cycles of the current sign that have occurred up to `start_year`.
- Adding 1 ensures we are considering the next cycle.
- Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the next occurrence of the sign.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's go through the first example given in the problem:
- For `n = 6` and `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`:
  - Start with `start_year = 0`.
  - For the first sign (`a_1 = 3`), the next occurrence is `(0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`.
  - For the second sign (`a_2 = 2`), the next occurrence after year 3 is `(3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`.
  - For the third sign (`a_3 = 4`), the next occurrence after year 4 is `(4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`.
  - For the fourth sign (`a_4 = 5`), the next occurrence after year 8 is `(8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`.
  - For the fifth sign (`a_5 = 9`), the next occurrence after year 10 is `(10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`.
  - For the sixth sign (`a_6 = 18`), the next occurrence after year 18 is `(18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`.

The program correctly computes `36` as the year for the sixth sign to occur, which matches the example output.

### Function Summary:
The function summary states that the function calculates and prints the smallest year that is a multiple of all integers in the list. However, this is not entirely accurate for the problem at hand. The function correctly computes the year in which each subsequent sign occurs sequentially, not the least common multiple of all the periods.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs, following the sequential requirement of the problem. The function summary is somewhat misleading, but the program's behavior matches the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
