Reasoning:  
The given program is designed to solve the problem by calculating the year in which the n-th sign occurs, ensuring that each sign occurs sequentially as per the rules provided. The program iterates over each test case, and for each test case, it iterates over the list of periodicities (years after which each sign occurs). It calculates the year of occurrence for each sign sequentially, ensuring that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one. 

The core logic of the program is as follows:
- For each test case, it initializes `start_year` to 0.
- It then iterates over the list of periodicities.
- For each periodicity `nums[x]`, it calculates the next year in which the sign can occur by finding the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than the current `start_year`. This is done using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
- This process ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one, as required by the problem statement.

The execution summary suggests that the function processes multiple test cases and calculates the smallest year that is a multiple of all integers in the list for each test case, which aligns with the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the program is correct.
