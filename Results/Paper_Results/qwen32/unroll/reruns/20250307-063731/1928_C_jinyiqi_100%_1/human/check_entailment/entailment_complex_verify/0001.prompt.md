You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given Python program is correct, we need to analyze its logic and compare it with the problem requirements. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program and the problem:

### Problem Requirements
1. **Settling Pattern**: The pattern of numbers repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
2. **Constraints**:
   - `k > 1`
   - `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`
   - For each test case, find the number of valid `k` values that fit the given position `n` and number `x`.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.

2. **Logic**:
   - The program checks two conditions:
     - `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`
     - `(n - x) % 2 == 0`
   - For each condition, it calls `func_1` to find divisors of the respective expression.
   - It then checks if `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` for each divisor `s`.
   - If the conditions are met, it adds `(s + 2) / 2` to the `output` list.
   - It ensures unique values in the `output` list using `set(output)`.
   - Finally, it prints the length of the `output` list, which represents the number of valid `k` values.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function finds all divisors of a given number `x`.
   - It iterates from `1` to `sqrt(x)` to find divisors and stores them in two lists: `output1` and `output2`.
   - It reverses `output1` and concatenates it with `output2` to get all divisors.
   - It returns the combined list of divisors.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Divisor Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` returns divisors in a specific order, but the program does not correctly utilize these divisors to determine valid `k` values.
   - The program should be checking if `(s + 2) / 2` is an integer and if it satisfies the conditions for `k`.

2. **Logic for Valid `k`**:
   - The program's logic for determining valid `k` values is flawed. It should be checking if the position `n` and number `x` fit within the repeating pattern of length `2k - 2`.
   - The program should consider the position within the repeating segment and ensure that `x` is within the valid range for `k`.

3. **Output**:
   - The output should be the number of valid `k` values, but the current logic does not correctly identify these values.

### Correctness
Given the issues identified in the program's logic and handling of divisors, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
