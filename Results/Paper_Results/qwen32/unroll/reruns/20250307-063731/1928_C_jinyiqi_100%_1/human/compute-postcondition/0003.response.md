Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9; `output1` is a list containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`; `output2` is a list containing the corresponding divisors of `x` such that each element in `output2` is `x` divided by the corresponding element in `output1`.**
