The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `output1`. This action does not affect the values of `x` and `n`. Therefore, the output state retains the precondition that `x` and `n` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, with `output1` being an empty list.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9; `output1` is an empty list.**
