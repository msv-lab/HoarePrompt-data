### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the number of valid `k` values that fit the given constraints for Vasya's position `n` and the number `x` he received during the settling process. The settling process repeats every `2k - 2` positions. The key is to find all possible `k` values such that Vasya's position `n` and the number `x` he received conform to the described pattern.

The approach in the program involves:
1. Checking two conditions based on the expressions `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0`.
2. For each condition, it finds the divisors of the corresponding expression using the `func_1` function.
3. It then checks if `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and if `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` for each divisor `s` found.
4. It collects valid `k` values and prints the count of unique `k` values.

Let's analyze the logic:

- The expression `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` are used to determine the potential ranges where `k` could fit. These conditions ensure that the position `n` and the number `x` can fit into the repeating pattern of the settling process.
- The `func_1` function finds all divisors of a given number `x`. This is crucial because the pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and the divisors help in finding all possible `k` values.
- The condition `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` ensures that the divisor `s` can be transformed into a valid `k` value.
- The condition `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` ensures that the `k` value is large enough to accommodate the number `x` Vasya received.

Given the problem constraints and the logic in the program, it correctly identifies all possible `k` values that fit the given conditions. The program handles the input and output as per the problem statement and correctly computes the number of valid `k` values.
