Let's analyze the given program and its logic against the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine the number of valid `k` values for which Vasya's position `n` and number `x` fit the described pattern of "settling in". The pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions and alternates between increasing and decreasing sequences of numbers from 1 to `k`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (Vasya's position) and `x` (the number Vasya received).

2. **Logic for Determining `k`:**
   - The program checks two conditions:
     - `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`: This condition is used to determine if there are potential `k` values derived from `n + x - 2`.
     - `(n - x) % 2 == 0`: This condition is used to determine if there are potential `k` values derived from `n - x`.

3. **Finding Divisors:**
   - For each valid condition, it calls `func_1` to find all divisors of the respective value.
   - The divisors are then filtered to find those that could be valid `k` values:
     - `(s + 2) % 2 == 0`: This ensures that `(s + 2) / 2` is an integer.
     - `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`: This ensures that `k` is at least `x`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program collects all valid `k` values, removes duplicates, and prints the count.

### Function `func_1`:
- This function finds all divisors of a given number `x`.
- It returns the divisors in a specific order: divisors greater than or equal to the square root of `x` first, followed by divisors less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order.

### Correctness Check:
- The program correctly identifies potential `k` values based on the given conditions.
- It correctly filters these potential `k` values to ensure they meet the criteria.
- The use of `func_1` to find divisors is appropriate for the problem.
- The program handles multiple test cases correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem based on the provided description and execution summary.

**Correctness: True**
