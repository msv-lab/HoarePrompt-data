To solve this, we need to understand the structure of `output1` and `output2`:

1. `output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order.
2. `output2` contains the corresponding divisors of `x` such that each element in `output2` is `x` divided by the corresponding element in `output1`.

Given the return statement `return output2 + output1`, the final output will be a list that combines `output2` and `output1`.

Let's describe the output state:

- `output2` contains divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`, in the same order as their corresponding divisors in `output1`.
- `output1` contains divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, in reverse order.

When these two lists are concatenated, the result will be a list of all divisors of `x` in a specific order: first the larger divisors (from `output2`), followed by the smaller divisors in reverse order (from `output1`).

Therefore, the output state is the concatenation of `output2` and `output1`.

Output State: **The program returns a list of all divisors of `x`, with divisors greater than or equal to the square root of `x` listed first, followed by divisors less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order.**
