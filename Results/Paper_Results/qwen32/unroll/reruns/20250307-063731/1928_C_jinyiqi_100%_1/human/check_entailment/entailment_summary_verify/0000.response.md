To evaluate the correctness of the program, we need to analyze the logic used to determine the valid values of `k` based on Vasya's position `n` and the number `x` he received during the settling.

### Problem Analysis

The key insight is that the sequence of numbers repeats every `2k - 2` positions. Given Vasya's position `n` and the number `x` he received, we need to determine all possible `k` values that satisfy the conditions of the sequence.

### Program Analysis

The program uses the function `func_1` to find the divisors of certain numbers derived from `n` and `x`. The main logic then checks if these divisors can be used to determine valid `k` values.

- **Condition 1:** `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`
  - If true, it calculates `sep = func_1(n + x - 2)` and checks if `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` for each divisor `s`.
- **Condition 2:** `(n - x) % 2 == 0`
  - If true, it calculates `sep = func_1(n - x)` and checks if `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` for each divisor `s`.

### Function Summary

The function `func_1(x)` returns all divisors of `x`, with divisors greater than or equal to the square root of `x` listed first, followed by divisors less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order.

### Evaluation of the Program

Let's break down the logic and see if it correctly identifies valid `k` values.

1. **Condition Checks:**
   - `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` are used to determine potential divisors.
   - These conditions ensure that the derived numbers are even, which is necessary for the sequence to repeat in the specified manner.

2. **Divisor Checks:**
   - For each divisor `s` of `(n + x - 2)` or `(n - x)`, the program checks if `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.
   - `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` ensures that `(s + 2)` is even, which is necessary for `(s + 2) / 2` to be an integer.
   - `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` ensures that the derived `k` value is at least `x`.

3. **Finding `k`:**
   - The valid `k` values are those that fit the sequence rules, meaning `k` must be such that the sequence repeats every `2k - 2` positions and Vasya's position `n` corresponds to the number `x`.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's consider the first test case:
- Input: `n = 10`, `x = 2`
- Expected Output: `4` (valid `k` values: 2, 3, 5, 6)

1. **Condition 1:**
   - `(10 + 2 - 2) % 2 == 0` → `10 % 2 == 0` → True
   - `sep = func_1(10)` → `[1, 2, 5, 10]`
   - Check divisors:
     - `s = 1`: `(1 + 2) % 2 == 0` → False
     - `s = 2`: `(2 + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(2 + 2) / 2 >= 2` → True → `k = 2`
     - `s = 5`: `(5 + 2) % 2 == 0` → False
     - `s = 10`: `(10 + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(10 + 2) / 2 >= 2` → True → `k = 6`

2. **Condition 2:**
   - `(10 - 2) % 2 == 0` → `8 % 2 == 0` → True
   - `sep = func_1(8)` → `[1, 2, 4, 8]`
   - Check divisors:
     - `s = 1`: `(1 + 2) % 2 == 0` → False
     - `s = 2`: `(2 + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(2 + 2) / 2 >= 2` → True → `k = 2` (already counted)
     - `s = 4`: `(4 + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(4 + 2) / 2 >= 2` → True → `k = 3`
     - `s = 8`: `(8 + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(8 + 2) / 2 >= 2` → True → `k = 5`

The valid `k` values identified are 2, 3, 5, 6, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion

The program correctly identifies the valid `k` values based on the given conditions and the sequence rules. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is inaccurate.

**Final: True**
