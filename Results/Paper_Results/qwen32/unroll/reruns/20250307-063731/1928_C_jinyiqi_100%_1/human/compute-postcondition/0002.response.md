To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1)`. The variables `i`, `x`, and the expression `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` are relevant here.

### Analysis:
1. **`i`**: This is the loop variable and will be initialized to 1 at the start of the loop. We don't need to adjust `i` before the loop starts because it is controlled by the `range` function.

2. **`x`**: The loop will iterate from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than 1. This means `int(x ** 0.5)` must be at least 1, which implies `x` must be at least 1. Given the initial condition `1 <= x < n <= 10^9`, `x` is already within the correct range, so no adjustment is needed for `x`.

3. **`n`**: The variable `n` is not directly involved in the loop condition, so it doesn't need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

4. **`output1` and `output2`**: These are not part of the loop head and are not relevant to whether the loop can execute or not. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial conditions and the loop head, the loop will execute as long as `x` is at least 1, which is already satisfied by the given condition `1 <= x < n <= 10^9`. No further adjustment is necessary for the loop to execute.

State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9; `output1` is an empty list; `output2` is an empty list**
