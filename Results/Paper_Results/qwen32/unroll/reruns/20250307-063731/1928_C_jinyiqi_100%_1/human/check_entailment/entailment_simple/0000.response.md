### Reasoning:
The task is to determine how many possible values of `k` fit the given constraints based on Vasya's position `n` and the number he received `x` during the settling process. The settling process repeats every `2k - 2` positions and follows a specific pattern of assigning numbers to positions.

The program provided appears to follow these steps:
1. **Input Parsing**: Reads the number of test cases and for each test case, reads `n` and `x`.
2. **Condition Checks**:
   - Checks if `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and calculates divisors of `(n + x - 2)` using `func_1`.
   - Checks if `(n - x) % 2 == 0` and calculates divisors of `(n - x)` using `func_1`.
3. **Divisor Processing**:
   - For each divisor `s` found in the above steps, it checks if `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and if `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, `(s + 2) / 2` is added to the output list.
4. **Output**:
   - The program removes duplicates from the output list and prints the number of unique values in the list.

The function `func_1(x)` is designed to return all divisors of `x`, which is used to find potential values of `k`. The logic seems to be based on the observation that the position `n` and the number `x` received by Vasya can be related to the divisors of `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the conditions for `k` by checking the divisibility of the positions and ensuring that the calculated `k` is valid (i.e., `k >= x`).
- The function `func_1(x)` correctly computes all divisors of `x`, which is crucial for finding the valid `k` values.
- The program removes duplicates and counts unique `k` values, which is necessary since multiple divisors might lead to the same `k`.

### Conclusion:
Given the problem constraints and the provided program, the logic appears to be correct. The program checks all necessary conditions and processes the divisors correctly to find the number of valid `k` values.

**Correctness: True**
