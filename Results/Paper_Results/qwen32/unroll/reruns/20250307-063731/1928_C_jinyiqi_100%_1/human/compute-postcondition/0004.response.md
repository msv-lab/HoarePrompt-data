The code `output1.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the list `output1`. The elements in `output2` are not affected because the code does not modify them. The precondition that `x` and `n` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9 remains valid. The precondition that `output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` remains valid, but the order of the elements in `output1` is now reversed. The precondition that `output2` contains the corresponding divisors of `x` such that each element in `output2` is `x` divided by the corresponding element in `output1` remains valid.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9; `output1` is a list containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order; `output2` is a list containing the corresponding divisors of `x` such that each element in `output2` is `x` divided by the corresponding element in `output1`.**
