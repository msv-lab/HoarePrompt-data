Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed to correctly solve the problem:

1. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is supposed to find all divisors of a number `x`, but it appends both `i` and `x/i` to the list. The list `output1` is reversed before concatenation, which is unnecessary and could lead to duplicate values if `x` is a perfect square. Instead, the function should append `x/i` only if it is different from `i`.

2. **Logic for calculating `k`**: The program attempts to calculate possible values of `k` based on the conditions `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0`. However, the logic to determine `k` from these conditions is incorrect. The correct approach involves considering the periodicity of the sequence and solving for `k` based on the given position `n` and received number `x`.

3. **Type of `k`**: The program calculates `k` as `(s + 2) / 2`, which should be an integer. The division should be integer division (`//`), not floating-point division (`/`).

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the edge cases where `k` is not valid, such as when `k <= 1`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        period = 2 * k - 2
        position_in_period = (n - 1) % period
        if position_in_period < k - 1:
            if position_in_period + 1 == x:
                count += 1
        else:
            if k - (position_in_period - (k - 2) - 1) - 1 == x:
                count += 1
    print(count)
```

This program iterates over possible values of `k` from 2 to `n`, checks if the given position `n` and number `x` fit the pattern for each `k`, and counts the number of valid `k` values.
