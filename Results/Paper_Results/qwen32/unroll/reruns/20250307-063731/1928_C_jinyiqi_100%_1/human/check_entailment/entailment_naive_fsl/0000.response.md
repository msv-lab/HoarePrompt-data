Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program includes a function `func_1` which is supposed to find the divisors of a number. However, the program uses this function in a way that does not correctly determine the valid values of `k` based on the given problem description.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`:** The function `func_1` returns a list of divisors. The main logic in the program uses these divisors to determine potential values of `k`. However, the conditions `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` do not correctly map to the problem's requirements for `k`.

2. **Logic for Determining `k`:** The problem requires finding `k` such that the sequence repeats every `2k - 2` positions. Given `n` (Vasya's position) and `x` (the number Vasya received), the logic should determine if `k` can fit the sequence rules. The current logic does not correctly handle these conditions.

3. **Edge Cases:** The program does not handle edge cases properly. For instance, when `n` and `x` are very large, the logic may not correctly determine the valid `k` values.

To illustrate, let's consider the first test case from the problem description:

Input:
```
5
10 2
```
Expected Output:
```
4
```
Explanation:
- For `k = 2`, the sequence is `1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2` (Vasya's position 10 has `x = 2`).
- For `k = 3`, the sequence is `1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2` (Vasya's position 10 has `x = 2`).
- For `k = 5`, the sequence is `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2` (Vasya's position 10 has `x = 2`).
- For `k = 6`, the sequence is `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2` (Vasya's position 10 has `x = 2`).

The current program does not correctly identify these values of `k`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and the Correctness is **False**.
