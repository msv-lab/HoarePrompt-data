### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is intended to solve the problem of finding the maximum number \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges from a tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least \( x \).

Let's break down the program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices \( n \) and the number of edges to be removed \( k \).
   - It then reads \( n-1 \) edges defining the tree.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it constructs an adjacency list `g` representing the tree.
   - It performs a binary search on the possible values of \( x \) (from 1 to \( n/k \)).
   - For each midpoint value `mid` in the binary search, it calls the `check(mid)` function to determine if it's possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges such that all remaining components have at least `mid` vertices.

3. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - The `check(A)` function uses a depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree and count the sizes of the subtrees.
   - It keeps track of the number of subtrees that have at least `A` vertices.
   - If the number of such subtrees is greater than \( k \), or if it equals \( k \) and the size of the entire tree is at least `A`, it returns `True`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the largest value of `mid` for which `check(mid)` returns `True`.

### Issues in the Program:

- **Global Variable `g`**:
  - The adjacency list `g` is defined within the `func_1` function but is used in the `check` function without being passed as an argument.
  - This makes the code incorrect because `g` is not accessible in the `check` function scope.

### Correctness:

Given the issue with the global variable `g`, the program as written is incorrect. To fix it, `g` should be passed as an argument to the `check` function.

Correctness: **False**
