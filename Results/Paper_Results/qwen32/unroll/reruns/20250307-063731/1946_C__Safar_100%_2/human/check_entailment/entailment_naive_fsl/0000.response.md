Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `check` relies on a global variable `g` which is not defined within its scope. This will result in a `NameError` when `check` is called from `func_1`. Additionally, the variable `c` is defined but never used in `func_1`, which is likely an error.

However, the main issue lies in the logic of the `check` function. The function is supposed to determine if it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has at least `A` vertices. The current implementation does not correctly handle the condition where the root node itself forms a component and needs to be checked against `A`.

Let's look at a potential problematic case:

Consider a tree with 4 vertices and 3 edges, and we need to remove 1 edge such that each remaining component has at least 2 vertices:

```
1 -- 2 -- 3 -- 4
```

For `n=4` and `k=1`, the maximum `x` should be 2 because we can remove the edge between 2 and 3, resulting in two components: `{1, 2}` and `{3, 4}`.

However, the current implementation might incorrectly return 1 because it does not correctly account for the root node being a potential component.

To fix this, the `check` function should ensure that the root node is also checked against `A` and that the logic for counting components is correct. The global variable `g` should also be passed as an argument to `check` to avoid `NameError`.

Here's a corrected version of the `check` function:

```python
def check(A, g, k):
    stack = [(1, 1)]
    visited = set()
    d = {1: 1}
    r = 0
    while stack:
        (x, p) = stack[-1]
        if x not in visited:
            visited.add(x)
            d[x] = 1
            for node in g[x]:
                if node != p:
                    stack.append((node, x))
        else:
            if d[x] >= A:
                r += 1
            else:
                d[p] += d[x]
            stack.pop()
            del d[x]
    if r > k or (d[1] >= A and r == k):
        return True
    return False
```

And the `func_1` function should call `check` with `g` as an argument:

```python
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        g[b].append(a)
    l = 1
    r = n // k
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        if check(mid, g, k):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
    print(r)
```

With these corrections, the program should correctly handle the problem description for all potential cases. However, since the original code does not meet these requirements, the correctness is **False**.
