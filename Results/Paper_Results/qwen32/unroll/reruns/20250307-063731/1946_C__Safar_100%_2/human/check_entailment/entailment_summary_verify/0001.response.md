### Reasoning:

The original assessment identifies several critical issues with the provided code, which are valid points. Let's break down the issues and the proposed corrections:

1. **Global Variable `g`:**
   - **Issue:** The function `check` uses a global variable `g`, which is not defined within its scope. This will result in a `NameError` when `check` is called from `func_1`.
   - **Correction:** The variable `g` should be passed as an argument to the `check` function.

2. **Unused Variable `c`:**
   - **Issue:** The variable `c` is defined in `func_1` but never used. This could be a leftover from previous code or an error.
   - **Correction:** Remove the unused variable `c`.

3. **Logic of the `check` Function:**
   - **Issue:** The logic in the `check` function might not correctly account for the root node being a potential component and needs to be checked against `A`.
   - **Correction:** Ensure that the root node is also checked against `A` and that the logic for counting components is correct.

4. **Handling of Components:**
   - **Issue:** The function `check` should ensure that the root node is also checked against `A` and that the logic for counting components is correct.
   - **Correction:** The function `check` should correctly count the number of components and ensure that the root node is considered.

The suggested corrections address these issues and improve the code's correctness. Here is the corrected version of the code based on the original assessment:

```python
# Function 1:
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        g[b].append(a)
    l = 1
    r = n // k
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        if check(mid, g, k):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
    print(r)

# Function 2:
def check(A, g, k):
    stack = [(1, 1)]
    visited = set()
    d = {1: 1}
    r = 0
    while stack:
        (x, p) = stack[-1]
        if x not in visited:
            visited.add(x)
            d[x] = 1
            for node in g[x]:
                if node != p:
                    stack.append((node, x))
        else:
            if d[x] >= A:
                r += 1
            else:
                d[p] += d[x]
            stack.pop()
            del d[x]
    if r > k or (d[1] >= A and r == k):
        return True
    return False
```

### Final Evaluation:

After applying the corrections, the program should correctly handle the problem description for all potential cases. The original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues and proposing the necessary corrections. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**

The original code was incorrect due to the issues highlighted, but with the corrections, it would be correct. Since the task is to evaluate the correctness of the given program (not the corrected version), the final assessment is **False**.
