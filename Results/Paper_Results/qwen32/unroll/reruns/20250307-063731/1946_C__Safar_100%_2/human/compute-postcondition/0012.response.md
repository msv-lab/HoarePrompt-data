Functionality: **The function `check` determines whether there are more than `k` subtrees in a given tree (represented by adjacency list `g`) with at least `A` nodes, or exactly `k` such subtrees where the entire tree itself has at least `A` nodes. It returns `True` if either condition is met, otherwise it returns `False`.**
