### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number \( x \) such that removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree results in each remaining connected component having at least \( x \) vertices. The program uses a binary search approach to determine this value.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - The tree is represented as an adjacency list `g` where `g[i]` contains all nodes directly connected to node `i`.
   - The graph is built by iterating through the list of edges and adding bidirectional connections.

2. **Binary Search Initialization**:
   - The binary search is initialized with `l = 1` and `r = n // k`. The reason for setting `r` to `n // k` is that the maximum possible component size \( x \) cannot exceed `n // k` because removing \( k \) edges can split the tree into at most \( k+1 \) components, each having at least \( x \) vertices.

3. **Binary Search Execution**:
   - The binary search loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
   - In each iteration, the middle value `mid` is calculated.
   - The `check(mid)` function is called to determine if it is possible to split the tree into components of at least size `mid` by removing exactly `k` edges.

4. **Check Function**:
   - The `check` function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on the tree starting from node 1.
   - It keeps track of the size of each subtree using a dictionary `d`.
   - If a subtree's size is at least `A`, it increments the count `r` of such subtrees.
   - If a subtree's size is less than `A`, its size is added to its parent's size.
   - The function returns `True` if the number of subtrees of size at least `A` is less than or equal to \( k \) and the remaining tree (if any) also has a size of at least `A`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

5. **Binary Search Adjustment**:
   - If `check(mid)` returns `True`, it means it is possible to split the tree into components of at least size `mid` by removing exactly \( k \) edges. Therefore, the search range is adjusted to `l = mid + 1` to find a potentially larger valid `x`.
   - If `check(mid)` returns `False`, it means it is not possible to split the tree into components of at least size `mid` by removing exactly \( k \) edges. Therefore, the search range is adjusted to `r = mid - 1`.

6. **Result Output**:
   - The binary search loop terminates when `l` exceeds `r`. At this point, `r` holds the maximum valid value of \( x \).
   - The value of `r` is printed as the result for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the binary search approach to find the maximum number \( x \) such that removing exactly \( k \) edges from the tree results in each remaining connected component having at least \( x \) vertices. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
