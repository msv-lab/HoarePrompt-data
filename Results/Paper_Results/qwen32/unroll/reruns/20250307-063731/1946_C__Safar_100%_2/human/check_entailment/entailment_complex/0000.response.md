### Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem by using a binary search approach to find the maximum size `x` of the connected components after removing exactly `k` edges from the tree. Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges `k` to be removed.
   - It then reads the `n-1` edges of the tree.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Constructs an adjacency list `g` from the edges.
   - Initializes the binary search bounds `l` and `r` as `1` and `n // k`, respectively.
   - Uses a binary search to find the maximum `x` such that it's possible to remove exactly `k` edges and have each remaining component have at least `x` vertices.
   - Calls the `check` function with the middle value `mid` of the current search range to determine if such a configuration is possible.

3. **Function `check`:**
   - Performs a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the tree and count the sizes of the connected components.
   - Uses a stack to traverse the tree and a dictionary `d` to keep track of the sizes of the subtrees.
   - If a subtree has at least `A` nodes, it increments the count `r` of such subtrees.
   - If a subtree has fewer than `A` nodes, its size is added to its parent's subtree size.
   - Returns `True` if there are exactly `k` subtrees of size at least `A` or if there are fewer than `k` such subtrees but the entire tree has at least `A` nodes.
   - Returns `False` otherwise.

### Correctness:

- **Binary Search:** The binary search in `func_1` is correctly implemented to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition. The search range is from `1` to `n // k`, which is a reasonable upper bound since the maximum possible size of each component after removing `k` edges is at most `n // k`.
  
- **DFS and Subtree Size Calculation:** The `check` function correctly uses DFS to calculate the sizes of the subtrees. The stack-based approach ensures that all nodes are visited, and the dictionary `d` accurately keeps track of the sizes of the subtrees.

- **Condition Checking:** The condition in `check` ensures that the number of components of size at least `A` is exactly `k` or, if there are fewer than `k` such components, the entire tree has at least `A` nodes.

- **Edge Cases:** The program handles the constraints and edge cases correctly. For example, if `k` is `1`, the program finds the largest possible size `x` such that the tree can be split into two components, each with at least `x` vertices.

### Conclusion:

Given the above reasoning, the program is correctly implemented to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
