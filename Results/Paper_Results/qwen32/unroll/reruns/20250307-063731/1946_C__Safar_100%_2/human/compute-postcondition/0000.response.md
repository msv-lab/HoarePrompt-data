Output State: **A is a positive integer, g is an adjacency list representing the tree with n vertices, k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, stack is [(1, 1)]**.

In this output state, the only change is that the variable `stack` has been initialized with the tuple `(1, 1)`. All other variables (`A`, `g`, and `k`) retain their initial values and properties as described in the initial state.
