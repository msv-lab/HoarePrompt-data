### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum size `x` such that after removing exactly `k` edges from a tree, all remaining connected components have at least `x` vertices.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The main function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a tree described by its number of vertices `n`, number of edges to remove `k`, and the edges themselves.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, k, edges)` to determine the maximum `x`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It constructs an adjacency list `g` to represent the tree.
   - It uses binary search to find the maximum `x` for which the condition (checked by `check(mid)`) is true.
   - The binary search range is from `1` to `n // k` because the maximum possible size `x` of each component, after removing `k` edges, cannot exceed `n // k`.

4. **Function `check`**:
   - It performs a depth-first search (DFS) on the tree starting from the root (vertex `1`).
   - It keeps track of the size of each subtree using a dictionary `d`.
   - It counts the number of subtrees `r` that have at least `A` nodes.
   - The function returns `True` if either:
     - The number of such subtrees `r` is greater than `k`.
     - The number of such subtrees `r` equals `k` and the entire tree has at least `A` nodes.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The binary search in `func_1` ensures that the maximum possible value of `x` is found efficiently.
   - The `check` function correctly counts the number of subtrees with at least `A` nodes and ensures that the conditions for the problem are met.
   - The DFS traversal in `check` ensures that all subtrees are considered, and their sizes are calculated accurately.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem by leveraging binary search and DFS to efficiently find the maximum size `x` of the connected components after removing `k` edges.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
