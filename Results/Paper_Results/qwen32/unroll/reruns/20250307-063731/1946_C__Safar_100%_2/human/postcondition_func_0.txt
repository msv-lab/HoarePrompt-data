The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, the number of vertices in a tree; `k`, the number of edges to be removed; and `edges`, a list of tuples representing the edges in the tree. It calculates and prints the largest value `r` for which a certain condition (checked by the `check(mid)` function) holds true after attempting to remove `k` edges.
