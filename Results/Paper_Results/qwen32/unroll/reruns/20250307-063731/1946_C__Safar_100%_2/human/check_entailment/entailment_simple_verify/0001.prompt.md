You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number \( x \) such that removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree results in each remaining connected component having at least \( x \) vertices. The program uses a binary search approach to determine this value.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - The tree is represented as an adjacency list `g` where `g[i]` contains all nodes directly connected to node `i`.
   - The graph is built by iterating through the list of edges and adding bidirectional connections.

2. **Binary Search Initialization**:
   - The binary search is initialized with `l = 1` and `r = n // k`. The reason for setting `r` to `n // k` is that the maximum possible component size \( x \) cannot exceed `n // k` because removing \( k \) edges can split the tree into at most \( k+1 \) components, each having at least \( x \) vertices.

3. **Binary Search Execution**:
   - The binary search loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
   - In each iteration, the middle value `mid` is calculated.
   - The `check(mid)` function is called to determine if it is possible to split the tree into components of at least size `mid` by removing exactly `k` edges.

4. **Check Function**:
   - The `check` function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on the tree starting from node 1.
   - It keeps track of the size of each subtree using a dictionary `d`.
   - If a subtree's size is at least `A`, it increments the count `r` of such subtrees.
   - If a subtree's size is less than `A`, its size is added to its parent's size.
   - The function returns `True` if the number of subtrees of size at least `A` is less than or equal to \( k \) and the remaining tree (if any) also has a size of at least `A`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

5. **Binary Search Adjustment**:
   - If `check(mid)` returns `True`, it means it is possible to split the tree into components of at least size `mid` by removing exactly \( k \) edges. Therefore, the search range is adjusted to `l = mid + 1` to find a potentially larger valid `x`.
   - If `check(mid)` returns `False`, it means it is not possible to split the tree into components of at least size `mid` by removing exactly \( k \) edges. Therefore, the search range is adjusted to `r = mid - 1`.

6. **Result Output**:
   - The binary search loop terminates when `l` exceeds `r`. At this point, `r` holds the maximum valid value of \( x \).
   - The value of `r` is printed as the result for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the binary search approach to find the maximum number \( x \) such that removing exactly \( k \) edges from the tree results in each remaining connected component having at least \( x \) vertices. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
