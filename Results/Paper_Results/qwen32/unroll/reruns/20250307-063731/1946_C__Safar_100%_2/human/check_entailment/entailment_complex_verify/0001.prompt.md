You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/799bacd3be0dda357800fdfc3eadbf38ab259c51.png)

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `check` determines whether there are more than `k` subtrees in a given tree (represented by adjacency list `g`) with at least `A` nodes, or exactly `k` such subtrees where the entire tree itself has at least `A` nodes. It returns `True` if either condition is met, otherwise it returns `False`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `check` relies on a global variable `g` which is not defined within its scope. This will result in a `NameError` when `check` is called from `func_1`. Additionally, the variable `c` is defined but never used in `func_1`, which is likely an error.

However, the main issue lies in the logic of the `check` function. The function is supposed to determine if it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has at least `A` vertices. The current implementation does not correctly handle the condition where the root node itself forms a component and needs to be checked against `A`.

Let's look at a potential problematic case:

Consider a tree with 4 vertices and 3 edges, and we need to remove 1 edge such that each remaining component has at least 2 vertices:

```
1 -- 2 -- 3 -- 4
```

For `n=4` and `k=1`, the maximum `x` should be 2 because we can remove the edge between 2 and 3, resulting in two components: `{1, 2}` and `{3, 4}`.

However, the current implementation might incorrectly return 1 because it does not correctly account for the root node being a potential component.

To fix this, the `check` function should ensure that the root node is also checked against `A` and that the logic for counting components is correct. The global variable `g` should also be passed as an argument to `check` to avoid `NameError`.

Here's a corrected version of the `check` function:

```python
def check(A, g, k):
    stack = [(1, 1)]
    visited = set()
    d = {1: 1}
    r = 0
    while stack:
        (x, p) = stack[-1]
        if x not in visited:
            visited.add(x)
            d[x] = 1
            for node in g[x]:
                if node != p:
                    stack.append((node, x))
        else:
            if d[x] >= A:
                r += 1
            else:
                d[p] += d[x]
            stack.pop()
            del d[x]
    if r > k or (d[1] >= A and r == k):
        return True
    return False
```

And the `func_1` function should call `check` with `g` as an argument:

```python
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        g[b].append(a)
    l = 1
    r = n // k
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        if check(mid, g, k):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
    print(r)
```

With these corrections, the program should correctly handle the problem description for all potential cases. However, since the original code does not meet these requirements, the correctness is **False**.
