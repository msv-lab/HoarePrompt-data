The code snippet provided reads a line of input and splits it into two integers, which are then assigned to the variables `x` and `y`. This does not affect the initial state of `n`, `t`, the edges of the tree, or the starting nodes for the stone. The only change is that `x` and `y` are now assigned the values of the two integers read from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, and the last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) representing the starting nodes for the stone where 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n; `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input.**
