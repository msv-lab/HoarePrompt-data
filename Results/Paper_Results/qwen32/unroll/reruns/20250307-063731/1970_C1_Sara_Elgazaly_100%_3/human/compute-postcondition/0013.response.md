To determine the output state after the loop executes all its iterations, we need to analyze the loop's behavior based on the given initial state and the loop's code.

### Initial State:
- `tmp` is `z`
- `lst[z]` is an empty list (implying `rev[z]` is also an empty list because `lst` and `rev` are presumably inverses of each other in some context, or `rev[z]` is directly stated to be an empty list)
- `one` is either `True` or `False` (irrelevant to the loop's logic)
- `two` is `True`

### Loop Code:
```python
while rev[tmp] != []:
    two = not two
    tmp = rev[tmp].pop()
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition Check**: The loop continues to execute as long as `rev[tmp]` is not an empty list.
2. **Initial Condition**: Given that `tmp` is `z` and `rev[z]` is an empty list, the condition `rev[tmp] != []` evaluates to `False`.
3. **Loop Execution**: Since the condition is `False` from the start, the loop body is never executed.

### Conclusion:
- `tmp` remains `z` because the loop body is not executed.
- `two` remains `True` because the loop body is not executed.
- `one` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop.
- `lst[z]` and `rev[z]` remain unchanged because the loop does not modify them.

### Output State:
Output State: **`tmp` is `z`, `two` is `True`, `one` is unchanged, `lst[z]` is an empty list.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations (or in this case, does not execute at all), the variable `tmp` remains `z`, the variable `two` remains `True`, the variable `one` remains whatever value it was initially, and `lst[z]` remains an empty list.
