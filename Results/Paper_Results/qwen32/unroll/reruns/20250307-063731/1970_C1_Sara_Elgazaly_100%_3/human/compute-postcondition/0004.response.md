Let's analyze the provided code snippet and the loop to determine the output state.

### Initial State Recap
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, representing the number of nodes in the tree.
- `t` is 1, indicating the number of starting nodes for the stone.
- The next `n-1` lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree.
- The last line contains `t` integers (u_1, ..., u_t) representing the starting nodes for the stone.
- `x` and `y` are two integers read from the input.
- `lst` is a `defaultdict` of lists used to store the adjacency list of the tree.
- `rev` is an empty `defaultdict` of lists, also intended to store the adjacency list but in reverse.

### Loop Analysis
The loop runs `x - 1` times. In each iteration, it reads a pair of integers `(a, b)` from the input, and then it:
- Appends `b` to the list in `lst` corresponding to the key `a`.
- Appends `a` to the list in `rev` corresponding to the key `b`.

### Output State
After the loop executes all its iterations, the state of the variables `lst` and `rev` will be updated based on the pairs of integers read during the loop. The values of the other variables (`n`, `t`, the edges of the tree, the starting nodes for the stone, `x`, and `y`) will remain unchanged.

Specifically:
- `lst` will contain the adjacency list of the tree, where each key is a node and the corresponding value is a list of nodes that are directly connected to the key node.
- `rev` will contain the reverse adjacency list of the tree, where each key is a node and the corresponding value is a list of nodes that have an edge pointing to the key node.

### Natural Language Explanation
The loop reads `x - 1` pairs of integers from the input and constructs the adjacency list (`lst`) and the reverse adjacency list (`rev`) of a tree. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

### Output State Format
Output State: **`lst` is a defaultdict of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, and `rev` is a defaultdict of lists representing the reverse adjacency list of the tree. All other variables remain unchanged.**
