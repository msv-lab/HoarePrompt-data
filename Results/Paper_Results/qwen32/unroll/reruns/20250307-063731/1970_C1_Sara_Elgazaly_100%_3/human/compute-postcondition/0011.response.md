The value of `tmp` is updated to the value of `z`. The other variables (`lst[tmp]`, `one`, and `two`) remain unchanged. Since `lst[tmp]` was dependent on the previous value of `tmp`, it is now `lst[z]` instead of `lst[tmp]`.

Output State: **`tmp` is `z`, `lst[z]` is an empty list, `one` is either `True` or `False` depending on the number of iterations, `two` is `True`.**
