The code snippet provided initializes a `defaultdict` of lists named `lst`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, the edges of the tree, the starting nodes for the stone, or the integers `x` and `y`. The only change is the creation of the `lst` variable.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, and the last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) representing the starting nodes for the stone where 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n; `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input; `lst` is a defaultdict of lists.**
