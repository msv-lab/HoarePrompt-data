n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, edges is a list of n-1 tuples where each tuple contains two integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing the edges of the tree, and start_node is a list of t integers (where t=1 in this version) such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, indicating the starting node for the stone in each round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.
