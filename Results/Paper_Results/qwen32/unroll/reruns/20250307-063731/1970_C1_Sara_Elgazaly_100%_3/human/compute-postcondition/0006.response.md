Output State: **`lst` is a defaultdict of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `rev` is a defaultdict of lists representing the reverse adjacency list of the tree, `z` is an input integer, `tmp` is equal to `z`.**

In the output state, `lst` and `rev` retain their original values as they are not modified by the code snippet. The variable `z` remains an input integer, and a new variable `tmp` is introduced and assigned the value of `z`.
