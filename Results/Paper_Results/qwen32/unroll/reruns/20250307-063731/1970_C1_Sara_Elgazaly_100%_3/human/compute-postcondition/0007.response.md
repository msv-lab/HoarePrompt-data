The code snippet assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `one`. The other variables (`lst`, `rev`, `z`, `tmp`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`lst` is a defaultdict of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `rev` is a defaultdict of lists representing the reverse adjacency list of the tree, `z` is an input integer, `tmp` is equal to `z`, `one` is `True`.**
