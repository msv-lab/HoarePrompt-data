To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `i <= j` is satisfied right before the loop starts. The variables `i` and `j` are the only ones that can be adjusted according to the problem statement.

Given:
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `j` is initialized to `len(arr) - 1`, which is `n - 1` since `arr` has a length of `n`.

For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than or equal to `j`. Since `i` is 0 and `j` is `n - 1`, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1 (which is guaranteed by the problem constraints `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`).

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to `i` or `j` because the initial values already satisfy the condition `i <= j`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases; `i` is 0; `j` is `len(arr) - 1`.**
