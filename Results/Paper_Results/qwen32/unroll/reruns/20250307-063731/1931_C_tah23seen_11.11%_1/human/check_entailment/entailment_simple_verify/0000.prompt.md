You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases for making all elements of the array equal with the minimum number of burles. Let's analyze the logic and find a counterexample.

### Analysis of the Code
The function `func_1` attempts to find the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal by focusing on the longest prefix and suffix that are already equal. The idea seems to be to find the longest segment from the start and end of the array that already has the same value and then determine the cost to fill the middle part with that value.

However, the logic has several shortcomings:
1. It only considers the longest matching prefix and suffix and assumes that filling the middle part with the value of the prefix/suffix is the optimal solution, which is not always true.
2. It does not consider other potential values that could be used to fill the array, which might result in a lower cost.

### Counterexample
Let's consider the following test case:
```
3
3
1 2 1
3
1 3 1
3
2 1 2
```
#### Expected Output:
```
2
2
2
```
#### Actual Output of the Provided Code:
```
2
2
1
```
For the third test case `[2, 1, 2]`, the provided code will output `1`, but the correct answer is `2`. Here's how:
- The longest matching prefix and suffix is just the single element `2` at the start and end.
- The code will then calculate the cost as `1` (for the middle element `1`), but this is incorrect because we need to change both `1`s to `2`s, which costs `2` burles.

### Conclusion
The provided code does not handle all cases correctly, particularly when the optimal solution involves changing the middle segment to a value that is not present at the ends of the array. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
