Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_1` does not account for the optimal way to make all elements of the array equal using the allowed operation. The program only checks the outermost elements and their sequences, but it does not explore all possible ways to apply the operation to minimize the cost.

For example, consider the test case:
```
3
1 2 3
```
The correct output should be `2`, as we can make all elements equal by changing either the first two elements to `2` or the last two elements to `2`, both at a cost of `2` burles. However, the provided program will return `1`, which is incorrect.

A correct solution would involve checking all possible segments and values for `x` to determine the minimum cost, which is more complex than the current implementation.
