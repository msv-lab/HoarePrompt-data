Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Understanding
We need to find the minimum cost (in burles) to make all elements of an array equal by performing at most one operation where we can select a subarray and set all its elements to a given value. The cost of this operation is the length of the subarray.

### Provided Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it calls the `func_1` function, which is supposed to compute the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.

#### `func_1` Function Analysis
The `func_1` function tries to find the minimum cost by following these steps:
1. Initialize two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
2. Move these pointers towards each other as long as the elements at these positions are equal.
3. If `i` surpasses `j`, it means the array is already uniform, and the cost is `0`.
4. If the elements at `i` and `j` are not equal, it breaks the loop and checks if the elements at `i` and `i+1` are the same, incrementing `i` until it finds a different element.
5. If `j` is not at the end of the array, it returns the cost as the length of the subarray from `i` to `j`.
6. Otherwise, it returns the cost as `j - i`.

### Issues in the Program
The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum cost in all scenarios. Here are some issues:
1. The logic for determining the cost is flawed. It does not consider the optimal subarray to change to make all elements equal.
2. The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, it does not consider changing a subarray in the middle of the array to make all elements equal.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider:
1. Checking all possible values that could be used to make the array uniform.
2. For each possible value, determine the minimum cost to make all elements equal to that value by selecting an appropriate subarray.
3. The cost is the length of the subarray that needs to be changed.

### Conclusion
Given the issues in the provided program, it does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
