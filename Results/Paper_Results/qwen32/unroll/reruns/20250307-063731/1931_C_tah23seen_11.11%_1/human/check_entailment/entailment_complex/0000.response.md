Reasoning: The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the array is a palindrome and then calculating the minimum cost to make the array uniform. However, the logic in the function `func_1` is incorrect for the given problem. The function is supposed to determine the least amount of burles needed to make all elements of the array equal by applying the operation at most once, but it does not correctly compute this value.

Here are some issues with the provided function:
1. The function only checks if the array is a palindrome and calculates the cost based on the mismatch positions. It does not consider the possibility of setting all elements to a single value by choosing an appropriate `i`, `j`, and `x`.
2. The function does not explore other potential values of `i`, `j`, and `x` that could result in a lower cost to make the array uniform.
3. The function does not handle cases where the optimal solution involves setting a segment of the array to a value that is not present at the ends of the array.

For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`. The function will return `4` because it calculates the cost to make the array a palindrome by changing the middle elements. However, the optimal solution is to set all elements to `1` or `5` with a cost of `1` burle by choosing `i=2`, `j=5`, and `x=1` or `x=5`.

Therefore, the function does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
