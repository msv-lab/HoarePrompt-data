Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases for making all elements of the array equal with the minimum number of burles. Let's analyze the logic and find a counterexample.

### Analysis of the Code
The function `func_1` attempts to find the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal by focusing on the longest prefix and suffix that are already equal. The idea seems to be to find the longest segment from the start and end of the array that already has the same value and then determine the cost to fill the middle part with that value.

However, the logic has several shortcomings:
1. It only considers the longest matching prefix and suffix and assumes that filling the middle part with the value of the prefix/suffix is the optimal solution, which is not always true.
2. It does not consider other potential values that could be used to fill the array, which might result in a lower cost.

### Counterexample
Let's consider the following test case:
```
3
3
1 2 1
3
1 3 1
3
2 1 2
```
#### Expected Output:
```
2
2
2
```
#### Actual Output of the Provided Code:
```
2
2
1
```
For the third test case `[2, 1, 2]`, the provided code will output `1`, but the correct answer is `2`. Here's how:
- The longest matching prefix and suffix is just the single element `2` at the start and end.
- The code will then calculate the cost as `1` (for the middle element `1`), but this is incorrect because we need to change both `1`s to `2`s, which costs `2` burles.

### Conclusion
The provided code does not handle all cases correctly, particularly when the optimal solution involves changing the middle segment to a value that is not present at the ends of the array. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
