You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), and the length of arr is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5). The function is called once for each test case, and the total number of elements across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. There is an additional integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i <= j:
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: The loop terminates with `i` greater than `j` if `arr` is a palindrome, otherwise `i` and `j` are at the positions where the mismatch occurred.
    if (i > j) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: The loop terminates with `i` not greater than `j`. If `arr` is a palindrome, `i` and `j` are equal and point to the same position. Otherwise, `i` and `j` are at the positions where the mismatch occurred.
    while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: `i` is incremented to the position where the element is different from the next element in the array, or it remains unchanged if all elements from the initial `i` position onwards are the same.
    if (j != len(arr) - 1) :
        return j - i + 1
        #The program returns the difference between `j` and `i` plus 1.
    #State: `i` is incremented to the position where the element is different from the next element in the array, or it remains unchanged if all elements from the initial `i` position onwards are the same. Additionally, `j` is equal to the last index of the array (`len(arr) - 1`).
    return j - i
    #The program returns the difference between the last index of the array and the position `i`, where `i` is the index where the element is different from the next element, or the last index if all elements from `i` onwards are the same.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), and the length of `arr` is n. The function returns 0 if a specific condition is met (Case_1). If another condition is met, it returns the difference between `j` and `i` plus 1 (Case_2). Otherwise, it returns the difference between the last index of the array and the position `i`, where `i` is the index where the element is different from the next element, or the last index if all elements from `i` onwards are the same (Case_3).

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns the difference between `j` and `i` plus 1.

Case_3: The program returns the difference between the last index of the array and the position `i`, where `i` is the index where the element is different from the next element, or the last index if all elements from `i` onwards are the same.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
