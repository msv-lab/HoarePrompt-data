arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the size of the array for a test case followed by a list of n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the elements of the array. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Each element a_i in the array satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The first element of arr is the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
