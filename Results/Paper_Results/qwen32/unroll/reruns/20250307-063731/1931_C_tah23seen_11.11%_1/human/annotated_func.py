#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), and the length of arr is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5). The function is called once for each test case, and the total number of elements across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. There is an additional integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i <= j:
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: The loop terminates with `i` greater than `j` if `arr` is a palindrome, otherwise `i` and `j` are at the positions where the mismatch occurred.
    if (i > j) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: The loop terminates with `i` not greater than `j`. If `arr` is a palindrome, `i` and `j` are equal and point to the same position. Otherwise, `i` and `j` are at the positions where the mismatch occurred.
    while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: `i` is incremented to the position where the element is different from the next element in the array, or it remains unchanged if all elements from the initial `i` position onwards are the same.
    if (j != len(arr) - 1) :
        return j - i + 1
        #The program returns the difference between `j` and `i` plus 1.
    #State: `i` is incremented to the position where the element is different from the next element in the array, or it remains unchanged if all elements from the initial `i` position onwards are the same. Additionally, `j` is equal to the last index of the array (`len(arr) - 1`).
    return j - i
    #The program returns the difference between the last index of the array and the position `i`, where `i` is the index where the element is different from the next element, or the last index if all elements from `i` onwards are the same.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` and returns 0 if the list is a palindrome. Otherwise, it returns the length of the longest suffix that can be removed to make the list a palindrome.
