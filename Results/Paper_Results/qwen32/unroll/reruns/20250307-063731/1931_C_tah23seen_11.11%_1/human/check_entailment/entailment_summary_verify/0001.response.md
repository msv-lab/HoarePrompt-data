Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding
The task is to find the minimum cost (in burles) to make all elements of an array equal by performing at most one operation where we can select a subarray and set all its elements to a given value. The cost of this operation is the length of the subarray.

### Provided Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it calls the `func_1` function, which is supposed to compute the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.

#### `func_1` Function Analysis
The `func_1` function tries to find the minimum cost by following these steps:
1. Initialize two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
2. Move these pointers towards each other as long as the elements at these positions are equal.
3. If `i` surpasses `j`, it means the array is already uniform, and the cost is `0`.
4. If the elements at `i` and `j` are not equal, it breaks the loop and checks if the elements at `i` and `i+1` are the same, incrementing `i` until it finds a different element.
5. If `j` is not at the end of the array, it returns the cost as the length of the subarray from `i` to `j`.
6. Otherwise, it returns the cost as `j - i`.

### Issues in the Program
The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum cost in all scenarios. Here are some issues:
1. **Flawed Logic**: The logic of the function is incorrect. It does not consider the optimal subarray to change to make all elements equal.
2. **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, it does not consider changing a subarray in the middle of the array to make all elements equal.
3. **Inadequate Consideration of All Values**: The function does not consider changing the array to any value that might minimize the cost. It only considers the subarray boundaries without trying different values.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. **Check All Possible Values**: Consider all possible values that could be used to make the array uniform.
2. **Determine Minimum Cost**: For each possible value, determine the minimum cost to make all elements equal to that value by selecting an appropriate subarray.
3. **Compute Cost**: The cost is the length of the subarray that needs to be changed.

### Correct Implementation
A correct implementation would involve:
- Iterating over all possible values from 1 to `n` (since `1 ≤ a_i ≤ n`).
- For each value, determine the minimum subarray that needs to be changed to make all elements equal to that value.
- Compute the cost for each value and keep track of the minimum cost.

### Conclusion
Given the issues in the provided program, it does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
