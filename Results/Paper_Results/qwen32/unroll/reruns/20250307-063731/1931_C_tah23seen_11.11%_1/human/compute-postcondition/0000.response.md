Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5). The function is called once for each test case, and the total number of elements across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. There is an additional integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. `i` is 0.**

In simple terms: The list `arr` and the integer `t` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is set to 0.
