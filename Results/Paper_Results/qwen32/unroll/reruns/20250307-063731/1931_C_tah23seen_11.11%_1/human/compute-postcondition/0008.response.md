Output State: **`i` is incremented to the position where the element is different from the next element in the array, or it remains unchanged if all elements from the initial `i` position onwards are the same.**

In simpler terms, the loop will continue to increment `i` as long as the current element at `i` is the same as the next element at `i + 1`. Once it finds an element that is different from the next one, it stops, and `i` points to that element. If all elements from the initial `i` position onwards are the same, `i` will be incremented until it reaches the end of the array or the condition `i < len(arr) - 1` is no longer satisfied.
