The variable `j` is assigned the value `len(arr) - 1`, which is the last index of the list `arr`. The other variables `arr`, `n`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases; `i` is 0; `j` is `len(arr) - 1`.**
