Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), and the length of `arr` is n. The function returns 0 if a specific condition is met (Case_1). If another condition is met, it returns the difference between `j` and `i` plus 1 (Case_2). Otherwise, it returns the difference between the last index of the array and the position `i`, where `i` is the index where the element is different from the next element, or the last index if all elements from `i` onwards are the same (Case_3).**
