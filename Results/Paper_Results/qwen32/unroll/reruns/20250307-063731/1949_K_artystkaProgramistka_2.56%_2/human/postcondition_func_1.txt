The function takes a positive integer `n` and three other positive integers `na`, `nb`, and `nc` such that their sum equals `n`. It also takes a list `numbers` of `n` positive integers. The function attempts to partition the list `numbers` into three groups of sizes `na`, `nb`, and `nc` respectively. If such a partition is possible and the condition checked by `func_1` is satisfied, it returns 'YES' along with the three groups. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
