The given Python code initializes three empty lists: `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. The initial conditions regarding `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order, `group_a` is an empty list, `group_b` is an empty list, `group_c` is an empty list.**
