Output State: **The program returns 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c**, where `group_a` is a list containing `na` numbers, `group_b` is a list containing `nb` numbers, and `group_c` is a list containing `nc` numbers, such that the sum of numbers in `group_a` is `sum_a`, the sum of numbers in `group_b` is `sum_b`, and the sum of numbers in `group_c` is `sum_c`, and `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` evaluates to True.
