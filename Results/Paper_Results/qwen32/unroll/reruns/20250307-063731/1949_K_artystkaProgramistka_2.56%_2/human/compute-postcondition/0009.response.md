Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. Here, `n` is a positive integer, and `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that their sum equals `n`. The parameter `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers. The function returns 'YES' along with three groups `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` if it is possible to partition the list `numbers` into three groups of sizes `na`, `nb`, and `nc` respectively. If such a partition is not possible, the function returns 'NO'.**
