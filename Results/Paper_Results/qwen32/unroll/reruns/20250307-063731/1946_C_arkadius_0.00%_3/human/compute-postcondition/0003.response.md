The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`, reading pairs of integers `u` and `v` from the input, and adding an edge between vertices `u-1` and `v-1` in the `tree`. After the loop completes, `k` edges will have been added to the `tree` (since the loop runs `n-1` times and each iteration adds one edge).

Output State: **`n` is the integer number of vertices input by the user, `k` is the integer number of edges to be removed input by the user such that 1 <= k < n, `tree` is an instance of the `Tree` class with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges added to it.**
