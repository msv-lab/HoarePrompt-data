### Reasoning:

Let's break down the given program step by step and see if it meets the problem description:

1. **Tree Representation:**
   - The `TreeNode` class represents each node in the tree, storing edges, children, subtree size, parent, good components, and remaining size.
   - The `Tree` class represents the entire tree, with methods to add edges and root the tree (both recursive and non-recursive versions).

2. **Traversal and Calculation:**
   - `func_1` and `func_2` are both recursive functions designed to traverse the tree and calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of components.
   - `func_1` uses an iterative approach with a stack to perform a post-order traversal of the tree.
   - `func_2` uses a recursive approach to perform a post-order traversal of the tree.
   - Both functions update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of each node based on the traversal and the given minimum size `x`.

3. **Validation:**
   - `func_3` checks if it's possible to remove `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `x` vertices.
   - It uses the results from `func_1` (or `func_2`) to determine if the number of good components and the remaining size meet the conditions.

4. **Binary Search:**
   - `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum possible value of `x` such that it is possible to remove `k` edges and each remaining component has at least `x` vertices.
   - It uses `func_3` to check if a given `x` is valid.

5. **Main Function:**
   - `func_5` reads input values, constructs the tree, roots it, and then calls `func_4` to find the maximum `x`.
   - It prints the result of `func_4`.

### Issues and Corrections:
- The main function `func_5` is called repeatedly in the main loop, but the function definition is not shown in the provided code snippet. The main loop should call `func_5` for each test case.
- The problem description specifies that the input consists of multiple test cases, and the output should be printed for each test case. The provided code does not correctly handle multiple test cases as it only calls `func_5` once.
- The main loop should be modified to call `func_5` for each test case, and the results should be printed accordingly.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning and the issues identified, the provided code is not fully correct due to the incorrect handling of multiple test cases. However, if we assume that the main loop correctly calls `func_5` for each test case, the logic within `func_5` and other functions seems correct.

Since the problem description and the provided code snippets do not match in terms of handling multiple test cases, the overall correctness is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
