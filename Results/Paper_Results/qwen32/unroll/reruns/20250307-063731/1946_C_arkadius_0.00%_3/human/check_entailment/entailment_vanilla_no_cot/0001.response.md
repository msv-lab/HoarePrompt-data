To determine if the given Python program is correct, we need to analyze each function and its role in solving the problem. The problem requires finding the maximum number \( x \) such that removing exactly \( k \) edges from the tree results in each remaining connected component having at least \( x \) vertices.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Tree Structure**:
   - The `Tree` class is not explicitly defined in the provided code, but it is implied that it should have methods for adding edges, rooting the tree, and storing information about vertices (children, good components, remaining size).

2. **Function 1: `func_1`**:
   - This function performs a post-order traversal of the tree starting from vertex \( s \).
   - It aggregates the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at \( s \).
   - A good component is defined as a subtree where the remaining size is at least \( x \).
   - The function returns the number of good components and the remaining size for the subtree rooted at \( s \).

3. **Function 2: `func_2`**:
   - This function is essentially the same as `func_1` but implemented recursively.
   - It also performs a post-order traversal and aggregates the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at \( v \).

4. **Function 3: `func_3`**:
   - This function checks if it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges such that each remaining component has at least \( x \) vertices.
   - It uses `func_1` to determine the number of good components and the remaining size of the entire tree.
   - If the number of good components is greater than \( k \), or if it is equal to \( k \) and the remaining size is at least \( x \), it returns `True`.

5. **Function 4: `func_4`**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the maximum \( x \) such that `func_3` returns `True`.
   - It initializes `beg` to 1 and `end` to \( n \).
   - It iteratively narrows down the range until `beg` equals `end`.

6. **Function 5: `func_5`**:
   - This function reads input for a single test case.
   - It constructs the tree, roots it, and then calls `func_4` to find the maximum \( x \).
   - It prints the result for the current test case.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The binary search in `func_4` ensures that we efficiently find the maximum \( x \) by checking possible values in logarithmic time relative to the range of possible sizes.
- Both `func_1` and `func_2` correctly perform post-order traversals and aggregate the necessary information.
- `func_3` correctly checks the conditions for the number of good components and the remaining size.
- The tree construction and rooting in `func_5` are correctly implemented based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum \( x \) such that removing exactly \( k \) edges results in each remaining component having at least \( x \) vertices. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
