The code `tree = Tree(n)` creates an instance of the `Tree` class with `n` as the number of vertices. This means that a new `Tree` object named `tree` is initialized with `n` vertices. The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer number of vertices input by the user, `k` is the integer number of edges to be removed input by the user such that 1 <= k < n, `tree` is an instance of the `Tree` class with `n` vertices.**
