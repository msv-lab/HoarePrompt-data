In the given for loop, the loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the state of these variables allows the loop to execute.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Variable `n`**: This variable represents the integer number of vertices in the tree. The range function `range(1, n)` will generate numbers starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1. Given that `n` is the number of vertices in a tree and it is provided by the user as an input, we need to ensure that `n` is indeed greater than 1.

2. **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` is the loop variable and it will take values from 1 to `n-1`. Before the loop starts, `i` does not need to be explicitly set because it is initialized by the `range` function. However, we need to ensure that the loop can start with `i` being 1, which is naturally handled by the `range(1, n)` function.

Given the conditions and the requirement that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the integer number of edges to be removed input by the user such that 1 <= k < n, `tree` is an instance of the `Tree` class with `n` vertices**
