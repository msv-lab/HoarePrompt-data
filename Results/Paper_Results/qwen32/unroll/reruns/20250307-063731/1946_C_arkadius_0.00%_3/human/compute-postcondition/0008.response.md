Functionality: **The function `func_3` accepts parameters `tree`, `n`, `k`, and `x`. The parameter `tree` is an object representing a tree structure with `n` vertices, where `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree. The parameter `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n. The parameter `x` is an integer representing the size of each remaining connected component. The function returns `True` if it is possible to remove `k` edges from the tree such that each of the remaining connected components has exactly `x` vertices; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
