### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number \( x \) such that removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree results in all remaining connected components having at least \( x \) vertices. The program uses a binary search approach combined with a depth-first search (DFS) to determine the maximum possible \( x \).

Here's a breakdown of the key components and their correctness:

1. **Tree Structure**:
   - The `TreeNode` class represents each vertex in the tree, storing its edges, children, subtree size, parent, number of good components, and remaining size.
   - The `Tree` class manages the vertices and provides methods to add edges and root the tree.

2. **DFS Traversal**:
   - `func_1` and `func_2` perform a DFS traversal to compute the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree.
   - `func_1` uses an iterative approach with a stack to perform the DFS, while `func_2` uses recursion.
   - Both functions update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex based on its children's values.

3. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - `func_3` checks if it's possible to have at least \( x \) vertices in each of the remaining components after removing \( k \) edges.
   - It uses the results from `func_1` to determine the feasibility of a given \( x \).

4. **Binary Search**:
   - `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum \( x \) that satisfies the conditions.
   - It repeatedly narrows down the search range based on the result of `func_3`.

5. **Main Function**:
   - `func_5` reads the input, constructs the tree, roots the tree, and then calls `func_4` to find and print the maximum \( x \).

### Verification of Correctness:

- **Tree Construction**: The tree is correctly constructed with edges and vertices.
- **DFS Implementation**: Both iterative (`func_1`) and recursive (`func_2`) DFS implementations are correct and consistent in updating subtree properties.
- **Feasibility Check**: `func_3` correctly checks if the conditions are met for a given \( x \).
- **Binary Search**: The binary search in `func_4` efficiently finds the maximum \( x \) by leveraging the feasibility check.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the described algorithm and handles the constraints provided in the problem statement. It efficiently finds the maximum \( x \) using a combination of DFS and binary search.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
