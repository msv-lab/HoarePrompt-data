### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Construction and Rooting**:
   - `Tree` class is used to represent the tree with `n` vertices.
   - Edges are added using `add_edge` method.
   - The tree is rooted using `root_tree_non_recursive` method starting from vertex 0.

2. **Component Evaluation**:
   - `func_1` and `func_2` are two versions of a recursive function that traverse the tree and evaluate the connected components based on a minimum size `x`.
     - `func_1` uses an iterative approach with a stack to avoid recursion depth issues.
     - Both functions update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex.
     - `good_components` count the number of components of size at least `x`.
     - `remaining_size` accumulates the size of components smaller than `x`.

3. **Feasibility Check**:
   - `func_3` checks if it's possible to remove `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `x` vertices.
     - It uses `func_1` to get the `good_components` and `remaining_size`.
     - It returns `True` if the number of `good_components` is greater than `k` or if it's exactly `k` and the `remaining_size` is at least `x`.

4. **Binary Search for Maximum `x`**:
   - `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum possible value of `x` such that the conditions in `func_3` are met.
     - It initializes `beg` to 1 and `end` to `n`.
     - It iteratively adjusts the search range based on the feasibility check performed by `func_3`.

5. **Main Function**:
   - `func_5` reads the input for each test case, constructs the tree, roots it, and then calls `func_4` to determine the maximum `x` for that test case.
     - It prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The problem requires finding the maximum `x` such that after removing `k` edges, each connected component has at least `x` vertices.
- The functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly evaluate the tree to determine the number of good components and the size of remaining components.
- `func_3` checks the feasibility of a given `x` based on the evaluation.
- `func_4` uses binary search to efficiently find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.
- `func_5` correctly orchestrates the input processing, tree construction, and result calculation for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the functions collectively solve the problem as described.
