You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/799bacd3be0dda357800fdfc3eadbf38ab259c51.png)

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, I'll analyze it step-by-step based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Tree Representation**:
   - The tree is represented with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges.
   - The input includes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, the tree structure is given, and the goal is to find the maximum number `x` such that removing exactly `k` edges results in all remaining connected components having at least `x` vertices.

2. **Algorithm Approach**:
   - The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum possible `x`.
   - The `func_1` and `func_2` functions perform a post-order traversal to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree.
   - The `func_3` function checks if it is possible to have at least `k` good components with each having at least `x` vertices.
   - The `func_4` function performs a binary search to find the maximum `x`.
   - The `func_5` function reads the input, constructs the tree, and prints the result.

### Code Analysis

1. **Tree Class**:
   - The `Tree` class is used to represent the tree and its vertices.
   - The `add_edge` method adds an edge between two vertices.
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method roots the tree at a given vertex.

2. **Post-order Traversal**:
   - Functions `func_1` and `func_2` perform a post-order traversal to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree.
   - The logic seems correct for counting good components and remaining sizes.

3. **Binary Search**:
   - The `func_4` function performs a binary search to find the maximum `x`.
   - The binary search logic seems correct, as it narrows down the possible values of `x` based on the feasibility check in `func_3`.

4. **Feasibility Check**:
   - The `func_3` function checks if it is possible to have at least `k` good components with each having at least `x` vertices.
   - The logic seems correct, as it uses the results from the post-order traversal to determine feasibility.

5. **Input Handling**:
   - The `func_5` function reads the input, constructs the tree, and prints the result.
   - The input handling seems correct, as it reads the number of vertices and edges, constructs the tree, and prints the result for each test case.

### Testing the Code

To ensure correctness, I'll consider a few edge cases and test the code:

1. **Edge Case 1**: 
   - A tree with `n=2` and `k=1`.
   - The tree has only one edge. Removing this edge results in two components of size `1`. The maximum `x` is `1`.

2. **Edge Case 2**:
   - A tree with `n=3` and `k=1`.
   - The tree is a path with three vertices. Removing one edge results in two components of size `2` and `1`. The maximum `x` is `1`.

3. **Edge Case 3**:
   - A tree with `n=4` and `k=2`.
   - The tree is a path with four vertices. Removing two edges results in four components of size `1`. The maximum `x` is `1`.

4. **Edge Case 4**:
   - A tree with `n=5` and `k=1`.
   - The tree is a star with one central vertex and four leaves. Removing one edge results in one component of size `4` and four components of size `1`. The maximum `x` is `1`.

5. **Edge Case 5**:
   - A tree with `n=6` and `k=2`.
   - The tree is a path with six vertices. Removing two edges results in three components of size `2`. The maximum `x` is `2`.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code and considering various edge cases, the program seems to correctly implement the logic to find the maximum `x` for each test case.

**Correctness: True**

The program correctly handles the input, constructs the tree, performs post-order traversal, and uses binary search to find the maximum `x` as per the problem description.
