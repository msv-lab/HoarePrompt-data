Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summaries to ensure the correctness of the solution. We will validate if the program meets the problem requirements and constraints.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to find the maximum number \( x \) such that removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree leaves all remaining connected components with at least \( x \) vertices.

### Solution Analysis:
The solution uses a binary search approach to find the maximum \( x \). It checks each candidate \( x \) using a depth-first search (DFS) to determine if it's possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges such that all remaining components have at least \( x \) vertices.

### Functions Breakdown:
1. **func_1**: This function performs a DFS to count the number of "good" components and the remaining size of the tree rooted at a vertex \( s \). A "good" component is one with at least \( x \) vertices.
2. **func_2**: This function is similar to `func_1` but is recursive. It also performs a DFS to count the number of "good" components and the remaining size.
3. **func_3**: This function uses the result from `func_1` to check if it's possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges such that all remaining components have at least \( x \) vertices.
4. **func_4**: This function performs a binary search on the possible values of \( x \) to find the maximum \( x \) that satisfies the condition.
5. **func_5**: This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to find the maximum \( x \).

### Correctness Analysis:
1. **Tree Construction**: The tree is constructed correctly from the input edges.
2. **DFS Implementation**: Both `func_1` and `func_2` implement DFS correctly to count the number of "good" components and the remaining size. The iterative approach in `func_1` should be more efficient given the constraints.
3. **Binary Search**: The binary search in `func_4` correctly narrows down the possible values of \( x \) by checking the feasibility using `func_3`.
4. **Edge Cases**: The solution handles edge cases such as small trees and large values of \( k \).

### Function Summary Analysis:
- **Function 5**: The summary provided for `func_5` is misleading. It states that the function calculates and prints the number of connected components in the tree after removing `k` edges, which is not accurate. Instead, `func_5` calculates and prints the maximum number \( x \) such that removing exactly \( k \) edges leaves all remaining connected components with at least \( x \) vertices.

### Detailed Validation:
- **DFS Correctness**: The DFS functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) are designed to correctly count the number of "good" components and the remaining size. The iterative approach in `func_1` is more suitable for the given constraints.
- **Binary Search Correctness**: The binary search in `func_4` properly checks the feasibility of each candidate \( x \) using `func_3`. The logic for adjusting `beg` and `end` based on the result of `func_3` is correct.
- **Edge Cases**: The solution handles edge cases appropriately, including scenarios where \( k \) is close to \( n \) or \( n \) is very small.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution using DFS and binary search. It handles the problem requirements and constraints appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
