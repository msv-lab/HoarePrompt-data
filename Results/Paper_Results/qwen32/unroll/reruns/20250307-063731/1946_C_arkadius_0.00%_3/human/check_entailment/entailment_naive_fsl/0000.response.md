To determine the correctness of the given program, I'll analyze it step-by-step based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Tree Representation**:
   - The tree is represented with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges.
   - The input includes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, the tree structure is given, and the goal is to find the maximum number `x` such that removing exactly `k` edges results in all remaining connected components having at least `x` vertices.

2. **Algorithm Approach**:
   - The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum possible `x`.
   - The `func_1` and `func_2` functions perform a post-order traversal to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree.
   - The `func_3` function checks if it is possible to have at least `k` good components with each having at least `x` vertices.
   - The `func_4` function performs a binary search to find the maximum `x`.
   - The `func_5` function reads the input, constructs the tree, and prints the result.

### Code Analysis

1. **Tree Class**:
   - The `Tree` class is used to represent the tree and its vertices.
   - The `add_edge` method adds an edge between two vertices.
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method roots the tree at a given vertex.

2. **Post-order Traversal**:
   - Functions `func_1` and `func_2` perform a post-order traversal to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree.
   - The logic seems correct for counting good components and remaining sizes.

3. **Binary Search**:
   - The `func_4` function performs a binary search to find the maximum `x`.
   - The binary search logic seems correct, as it narrows down the possible values of `x` based on the feasibility check in `func_3`.

4. **Feasibility Check**:
   - The `func_3` function checks if it is possible to have at least `k` good components with each having at least `x` vertices.
   - The logic seems correct, as it uses the results from the post-order traversal to determine feasibility.

5. **Input Handling**:
   - The `func_5` function reads the input, constructs the tree, and prints the result.
   - The input handling seems correct, as it reads the number of vertices and edges, constructs the tree, and prints the result for each test case.

### Testing the Code

To ensure correctness, I'll consider a few edge cases and test the code:

1. **Edge Case 1**: 
   - A tree with `n=2` and `k=1`.
   - The tree has only one edge. Removing this edge results in two components of size `1`. The maximum `x` is `1`.

2. **Edge Case 2**:
   - A tree with `n=3` and `k=1`.
   - The tree is a path with three vertices. Removing one edge results in two components of size `2` and `1`. The maximum `x` is `1`.

3. **Edge Case 3**:
   - A tree with `n=4` and `k=2`.
   - The tree is a path with four vertices. Removing two edges results in four components of size `1`. The maximum `x` is `1`.

4. **Edge Case 4**:
   - A tree with `n=5` and `k=1`.
   - The tree is a star with one central vertex and four leaves. Removing one edge results in one component of size `4` and four components of size `1`. The maximum `x` is `1`.

5. **Edge Case 5**:
   - A tree with `n=6` and `k=2`.
   - The tree is a path with six vertices. Removing two edges results in three components of size `2`. The maximum `x` is `2`.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code and considering various edge cases, the program seems to correctly implement the logic to find the maximum `x` for each test case.

**Correctness: True**

The program correctly handles the input, constructs the tree, performs post-order traversal, and uses binary search to find the maximum `x` as per the problem description.
