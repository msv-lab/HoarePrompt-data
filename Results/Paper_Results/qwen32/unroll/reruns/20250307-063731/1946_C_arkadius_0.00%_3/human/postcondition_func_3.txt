The function `func_4` accepts a tree represented by the object `tree` with `n` vertices and an integer `k` (less than `n`) representing the number of edges to be removed. It returns an integer `beg` which is the result of a binary search process likely determining a threshold or optimal value related to the number of edges that can be removed while maintaining certain properties of the tree.
