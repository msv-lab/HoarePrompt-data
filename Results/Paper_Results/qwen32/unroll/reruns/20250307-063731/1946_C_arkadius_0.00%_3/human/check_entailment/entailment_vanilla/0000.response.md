Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to find the maximum number \( x \) such that removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree leaves all remaining connected components with at least \( x \) vertices.

### Solution Analysis:
The solution uses a binary search approach to find the maximum \( x \). It checks each candidate \( x \) using a depth-first search (DFS) to determine if it's possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges such that all remaining components have at least \( x \) vertices.

### Functions Breakdown:
1. **func_1**: This function performs a DFS to count the number of "good" components and the remaining size of the tree rooted at a vertex \( s \). A "good" component is one with at least \( x \) vertices.
2. **func_2**: This function is similar to `func_1` but is recursive. It also performs a DFS to count the number of "good" components and the remaining size.
3. **func_3**: This function uses the result from `func_1` to check if it's possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges such that all remaining components have at least \( x \) vertices.
4. **func_4**: This function performs a binary search on the possible values of \( x \) to find the maximum \( x \) that satisfies the condition.
5. **func_5**: This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to find the maximum \( x \).

### Correctness Analysis:
1. **Tree Construction**: The tree is constructed correctly from the input edges.
2. **DFS Implementation**: Both `func_1` and `func_2` implement DFS correctly to count the number of "good" components and the remaining size. The iterative approach in `func_1` should be more efficient given the constraints.
3. **Binary Search**: The binary search in `func_4` correctly narrows down the possible values of \( x \) by checking the feasibility using `func_3`.
4. **Edge Cases**: The solution handles edge cases such as small trees and large values of \( k \).

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution using DFS and binary search. It handles the problem requirements and constraints appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
