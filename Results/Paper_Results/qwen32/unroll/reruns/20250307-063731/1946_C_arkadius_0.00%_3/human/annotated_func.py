#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` evaluates a tree structure starting from a specified vertex `v`, counting the number of connected components (referred to as `good_components`) that meet or exceed a minimum size `x`. It also calculates the cumulative size of components that are smaller than `x` (referred to as `remaining_size`). The function returns a tuple containing these two values.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a tree represented by the object `tree` with `n` vertices and an integer `k` (less than `n`) representing the number of edges to be removed. It returns an integer `beg` which is the result of a binary search process likely determining a threshold or optimal value related to the number of edges that can be removed while maintaining certain properties of the tree.

    #This is printed: result of func_4(tree, n, k) (where result depends on the specific implementation of func_4)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of vertices and an integer `k` representing the number of edges to be removed from a tree. It constructs a tree with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges, roots the tree, and then calculates and prints the number of connected components in the tree after removing `k` edges.
