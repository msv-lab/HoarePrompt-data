### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the provided program using the annotations and the problem description.

1. **Tree Construction**:
   - The tree is constructed from the input edges, and the `Tree` class correctly handles the addition of edges and the rooting of the tree. This part of the program appears correct.

2. **DFS Implementation**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function uses an iterative DFS to traverse the tree and update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex. The annotations describe that it correctly updates the attributes based on the traversal and conditions.
     - **Annotations**: The annotations confirm that the function correctly updates `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex based on the traversal and conditions.
     - **Correctness**: The iterative approach is appropriate and efficient given the constraints.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function is a recursive version of the DFS. The annotations confirm that it correctly updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex.
     - **Annotations**: The annotations confirm that the function correctly updates `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex based on the traversal and conditions.
     - **Correctness**: The recursive approach is correct but may hit recursion limits for large trees. The iterative approach in `func_1` is more robust given the constraints.

3. **Binary Search**:
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function checks if it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that all remaining components have at least `x` vertices by using the results from `func_1`.
     - **Annotations**: The annotations confirm that the function correctly interprets the results from `func_1` to determine if the condition is met.
     - **Correctness**: The logic is correct.
   - **Function 4 (`func_4`)**: This function performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.
     - **Annotations**: The annotations confirm that the binary search correctly narrows down the possible values of `x`.
     - **Correctness**: The binary search is correctly implemented and narrows down the correct `x`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles small trees and large values of `k` as described in the annotations.
     - **Annotations**: The annotations confirm that the program handles these edge cases correctly.
     - **Correctness**: The edge cases are correctly handled.

### Conclusion:

Based on the annotations and the problem description, the provided program correctly implements the solution using DFS and binary search. It handles the problem requirements and constraints appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
