The given code snippet calls the method `root_tree_non_recursive` on the `tree` object with arguments `0` and `-1`. This method is likely responsible for rooting the tree at vertex `0` and possibly performing some operations related to edge removal, given the context of `k` edges to be removed. However, the exact implementation details of `root_tree_non_recursive` are not provided, so we can only infer the state based on the method call and the precondition.

Since the method `root_tree_non_recursive` is called, it is reasonable to assume that the tree structure might be modified or restructured with vertex `0` as the root. However, the variables `n` and `k` are not directly modified by this method call, and their values remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is the integer number of vertices input by the user, `k` is the integer number of edges to be removed input by the user such that 1 <= k < n, `tree` is an instance of the `Tree` class with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges added to it, and the tree is now rooted at vertex `0`.**
