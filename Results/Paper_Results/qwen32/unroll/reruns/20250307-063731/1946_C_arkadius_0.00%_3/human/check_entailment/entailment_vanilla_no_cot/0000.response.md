To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to verify that it correctly implements the solution to the problem described. Let's break down the key components of the program and the problem requirements:

1. **Tree Representation**: The program uses a custom `Tree` class to represent the tree structure. The tree is rooted, and it seems to use a non-recursive approach to root the tree, which is important for the subsequent calculations.

2. **DFS Implementation**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are both intended to perform a depth-first search (DFS) on the tree. However, `func_1` uses an explicit stack to simulate the recursive behavior of DFS, while `func_2` is a recursive DFS. The goal of these functions is to calculate the number of "good components" (components with at least `x` vertices) and the remaining size of the component after processing its children.

3. **Binary Search for Maximum `x`**: The function `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum value of `x` such that the tree can be split into at least `k+1` components, each having at least `x` vertices. This is done by checking the feasibility of a given `x` using `func_3`.

4. **Feasibility Check**: The function `func_3` checks if it's possible to split the tree into at least `k+1` components, each of size at least `x`, by using the results of the DFS.

5. **Main Function**: The function `func_5` reads the input, constructs the tree, roots the tree, and then uses `func_4` to find and print the maximum `x`.

### Potential Issues

1. **Tree Construction and Rooting**: The tree is constructed by adding edges and then rooted non-recursively. This step seems correct based on the problem description.

2. **DFS Functions**: Both `func_1` and `func_2` are intended to perform DFS on the tree. However, only one of these functions should be used consistently. The program uses `func_1` in `func_3`, so `func_2` seems redundant unless it's used elsewhere in the code snippet not provided here.

3. **Binary Search**: The binary search in `func_4` is correctly implemented to find the maximum `x` by checking the feasibility of each midpoint using `func_3`.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program should handle edge cases such as the minimum and maximum possible values of `n` and `k`. The problem constraints are respected, but it's crucial to ensure that the DFS correctly handles all edge cases, such as trees with very few vertices or very few edges to be removed.

5. **Output**: The program prints the correct result for each test case, which is the maximum `x` that satisfies the problem constraints.

### Conclusion

Given that the program uses a correct approach to solve the problem (binary search combined with DFS), and there are no apparent logical errors in the provided code, the program should be correct based on the problem description. However, the presence of two DFS functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) that seem redundant and the lack of usage of `func_2` might indicate a potential issue, but it doesn't affect the correctness based on the provided code.

**Correctness: True**
