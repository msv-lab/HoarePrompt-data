To determine the output of the `print(func_4(tree, n, k))` statement, we need to understand the context and behavior of the `func_4` function given the initial state. Here is the breakdown:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is the integer number of vertices in the tree.
   - `k` is the integer number of edges to be removed, where \(1 \leq k < n\).
   - `tree` is an instance of the `Tree` class with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges, rooted at vertex `0`.

2. **Function `func_4`:**
   - Without the specific implementation of `func_4`, we can only infer its behavior based on typical operations involving trees and edge removal.
   - Common operations might include calculating the maximum distance between vertices, the number of connected components after edge removal, or some other property of the modified tree.

Given the lack of specific details about `func_4`, we can only describe the output in a general form based on typical operations:

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**
- The function `func_4` likely performs some operation on the tree after removing `k` edges.
- The exact nature of the output depends on what `func_4` is designed to compute.

Since we don't have the exact implementation of `func_4`, we can only describe the output in terms of what `func_4` computes.

**Possible Interpretations:**
- If `func_4` calculates the number of connected components after removing `k` edges, the output would be the number of such components.
- If `func_4` calculates the maximum distance between any two vertices in the modified tree, the output would be this distance.
- If `func_4` returns some other property, the output would be that property.

Given the general nature of the problem, the most precise description we can provide is:

Output: **result of func_4(tree, n, k) (where result depends on the specific implementation of func_4)**

If we assume a common operation, such as calculating the number of connected components, we could say:

Output: **number of connected components after removing k edges from the tree**

However, without the specific implementation, the most accurate and general answer is:

Output: **result of func_4(tree, n, k) (where result depends on the specific implementation of func_4)**
