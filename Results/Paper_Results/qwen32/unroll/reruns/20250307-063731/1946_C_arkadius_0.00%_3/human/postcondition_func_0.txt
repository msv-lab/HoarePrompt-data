The function `func_1` performs a traversal on a tree structure starting from a specified vertex `s`. It updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of each vertex based on the traversal and conditions related to the minimum size `x` of each connected component. The function returns a tuple containing the `good_components` and `remaining_size` of the starting vertex `s`.
