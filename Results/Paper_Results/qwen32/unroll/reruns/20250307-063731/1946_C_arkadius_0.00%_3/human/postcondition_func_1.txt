The function `func_2` evaluates a tree structure starting from a specified vertex `v`, counting the number of connected components (referred to as `good_components`) that meet or exceed a minimum size `x`. It also calculates the cumulative size of components that are smaller than `x` (referred to as `remaining_size`). The function returns a tuple containing these two values.
