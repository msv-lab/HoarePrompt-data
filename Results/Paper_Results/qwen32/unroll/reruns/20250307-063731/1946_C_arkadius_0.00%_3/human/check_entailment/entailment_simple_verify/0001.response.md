### Reasoning:

Let's verify the correctness of the program step-by-step based on the provided annotations and the original assessment.

#### Problem Understanding:
The task is to find the maximum number \( x \) such that removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree leaves all remaining connected components with at least \( x \) vertices.

#### Solution Analysis:
The solution uses a binary search approach to find the maximum \( x \). It checks each candidate \( x \) using a depth-first search (DFS) to determine if it's possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges such that all remaining components have at least \( x \) vertices.

#### Functions Breakdown:
1. **func_1**:
   - **Purpose**: Perform a DFS to count the number of "good" components and the remaining size of the tree rooted at a vertex \( s \).
   - **Annotations**: The annotations confirm that `func_1` correctly updates `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex in the tree based on the traversal and conditions.
   - **Correctness**: The iterative DFS approach in `func_1` is correct and should handle the constraints efficiently.

2. **func_2**:
   - **Purpose**: Similar to `func_1`, but recursive. It performs a DFS to count the number of "good" components and the remaining size.
   - **Annotations**: The annotations confirm that `func_2` correctly updates `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex in the tree based on the traversal and conditions.
   - **Correctness**: The recursive DFS approach in `func_2` is also correct, but `func_1` is preferred due to its iterative nature which avoids stack overflow issues given the constraints.

3. **func_3**:
   - **Purpose**: Use the result from `func_1` to check if it's possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges such that all remaining components have at least \( x \) vertices.
   - **Annotations**: The annotations confirm that `func_3` correctly interprets the results of `func_1` to determine if the condition is met.
   - **Correctness**: The logic in `func_3` is correct and correctly checks the feasibility of removing \( k \) edges to satisfy the condition.

4. **func_4**:
   - **Purpose**: Perform a binary search on the possible values of \( x \) to find the maximum \( x \) that satisfies the condition.
   - **Annotations**: The annotations confirm that `func_4` correctly narrows down the possible values of \( x \) using `func_3`.
   - **Correctness**: The binary search logic in `func_4` is correct and efficiently finds the maximum \( x \).

5. **func_5**:
   - **Purpose**: Read the input, construct the tree, and call `func_4` to find the maximum \( x \).
   - **Annotations**: The annotations confirm that `func_5` correctly reads the input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4`.
   - **Correctness**: The input handling and tree construction in `func_5` are correct.

#### Edge Cases:
- **Small Trees**: The solution handles small trees correctly.
- **Large Values of \( k \)**: The solution handles large values of \( k \) correctly by ensuring that the number of good components and the remaining size are correctly calculated.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution using DFS and binary search. It handles the problem requirements and constraints appropriately. The annotations confirm the correctness of each function's behavior and reasoning.

**Final: True**
