The code snippet takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts these parts to integers, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. Given that `n` and `k` were already defined with specific properties in the initial state, after running the code, `n` and `k` will hold the values input by the user, but the precondition that `1 <= k < n` must still hold true.

Output State: **`n` is the integer number of vertices input by the user, `k` is the integer number of edges to be removed input by the user such that 1 <= k < n.**
