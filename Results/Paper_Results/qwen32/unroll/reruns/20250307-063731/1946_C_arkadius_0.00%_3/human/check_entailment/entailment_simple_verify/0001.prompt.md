You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/799bacd3be0dda357800fdfc3eadbf38ab259c51.png)

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to find the maximum number \( x \) such that removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree leaves all remaining connected components with at least \( x \) vertices.

### Solution Analysis:
The solution uses a binary search approach to find the maximum \( x \). It checks each candidate \( x \) using a depth-first search (DFS) to determine if it's possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges such that all remaining components have at least \( x \) vertices.

### Functions Breakdown:
1. **func_1**: This function performs a DFS to count the number of "good" components and the remaining size of the tree rooted at a vertex \( s \). A "good" component is one with at least \( x \) vertices.
2. **func_2**: This function is similar to `func_1` but is recursive. It also performs a DFS to count the number of "good" components and the remaining size.
3. **func_3**: This function uses the result from `func_1` to check if it's possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges such that all remaining components have at least \( x \) vertices.
4. **func_4**: This function performs a binary search on the possible values of \( x \) to find the maximum \( x \) that satisfies the condition.
5. **func_5**: This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to find the maximum \( x \).

### Correctness Analysis:
1. **Tree Construction**: The tree is constructed correctly from the input edges.
2. **DFS Implementation**: Both `func_1` and `func_2` implement DFS correctly to count the number of "good" components and the remaining size. The iterative approach in `func_1` should be more efficient given the constraints.
3. **Binary Search**: The binary search in `func_4` correctly narrows down the possible values of \( x \) by checking the feasibility using `func_3`.
4. **Edge Cases**: The solution handles edge cases such as small trees and large values of \( k \).

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution using DFS and binary search. It handles the problem requirements and constraints appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
