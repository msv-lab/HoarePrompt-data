To determine the output state, we need to understand the behavior of the `distribute_number(num)` function, which is not provided in the question. However, based on the typical problem of distributing numbers into groups to balance their sums, we can infer a logical distribution method. 

Assuming the function `distribute_number(num)` distributes the numbers into `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` such that the sums `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are as balanced as possible, we can infer the following:

1. The numbers are iterated over in descending order.
2. Each number is added to one of the groups in a way that attempts to balance the sums of the groups.

Since the exact distribution strategy is not specified, let's assume the simplest and most common approach: adding each number to the group with the smallest current sum. 

After the loop finishes, all numbers will be distributed among the three groups, and the sums of these groups will be as balanced as possible given the distribution strategy.

Given this, the output state would look like this:

- `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` will contain `na`, `nb`, and `nc` numbers respectively.
- `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` will be the sums of the numbers in `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` respectively.

Since the exact numbers in each group depend on the distribution strategy and the specific numbers in the input list, we cannot specify the exact contents of `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` or the exact values of `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c`. However, we can describe the state in a general form.

Output State: **`group_a` contains `na` numbers, `group_b` contains `nb` numbers, `group_c` contains `nc` numbers; `sum_a` is the sum of numbers in `group_a`, `sum_b` is the sum of numbers in `group_b`, `sum_c` is the sum of numbers in `group_c`.**
