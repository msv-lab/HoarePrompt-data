Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (a positive integer representing the total number of integers), `na` (a positive integer representing the size of group A), `nb` (a positive integer representing the size of group B), `nc` (a positive integer representing the size of group C), and `numbers` (a list of `n` positive integers). It returns 'YES' along with three groups `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` if it is possible to partition the list of numbers into three groups of sizes `na`, `nb`, and `nc` respectively. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.**
