Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n`, three positive integers `na`, `nb`, and `nc` representing the sizes of three groups such that `na + nb + nc = n`, and a list `numbers` of `n` positive integers. It attempts to partition the list into three groups of sizes `na`, `nb`, and `nc` respectively. If successful, it returns 'YES' along with the three groups; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.**
