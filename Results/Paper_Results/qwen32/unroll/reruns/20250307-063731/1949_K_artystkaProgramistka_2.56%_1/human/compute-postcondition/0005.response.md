Postcondition: **`group_a` contains `na` numbers, `group_b` contains `nb` numbers, `group_c` contains `nc` numbers; `sum_a` is the sum of numbers in `group_a`, `sum_b` is the sum of numbers in `group_b`, `sum_c` is the sum of numbers in `group_c`. The condition `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` is true.**
