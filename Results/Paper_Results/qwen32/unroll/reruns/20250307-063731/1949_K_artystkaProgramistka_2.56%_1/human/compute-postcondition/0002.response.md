Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the total number of integers, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers representing the sizes of the three groups such that `na + nb + nc = n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order; `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists; `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are 0.**

In simple terms: The values of `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers` remain unchanged. The lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are still empty. The variables `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` have been initialized to 0.
