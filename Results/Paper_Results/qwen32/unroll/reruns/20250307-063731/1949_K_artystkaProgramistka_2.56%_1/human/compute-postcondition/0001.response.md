The provided code initializes three empty lists: `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. None of the existing variables (`n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, `numbers`) are affected by this initialization.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the total number of integers, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers representing the sizes of the three groups such that `na + nb + nc = n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order; `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists.**
