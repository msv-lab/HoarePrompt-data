The code provided reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The value of `t` is updated based on the input, but the conditions on `t` remain the same (1 <= t <= 50). No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 50.**
