Let's analyze the given program and determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Breakdown:
The task is to choose `n` cells in an `n x n` grid to maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells. The Manhattan distance between two cells `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is `|x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the integer `n`. Then it prints `n` points, each on a new line, with the x-coordinate always being `1` and the y-coordinate ranging from `1` to `n`.

Let's consider the example for `n = 3`:
- The points printed will be `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(1, 3)`.
- The Manhattan distances between these points are:
  - Between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: `|1-1| + |1-2| = 0 + 1 = 1`
  - Between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 3)`: `|1-1| + |1-3| = 0 + 2 = 2`
  - Between `(1, 2)` and `(1, 3)`: `|1-1| + |2-3| = 0 + 1 = 1`
- The set of distinct Manhattan distances is `{0, 1, 2}`.

For `n = 3`, the arrangement provided by the program does indeed result in a set of distinct Manhattan distances of `{0, 1, 2}`. However, the problem requires maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. For `n = 3`, a better arrangement would be `(2, 1)`, `(2, 3)`, and `(3, 1)`, which results in the set `{0, 1, 2, 3}`.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. It always places all points in the first row, which limits the variety of distances that can be achieved. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
