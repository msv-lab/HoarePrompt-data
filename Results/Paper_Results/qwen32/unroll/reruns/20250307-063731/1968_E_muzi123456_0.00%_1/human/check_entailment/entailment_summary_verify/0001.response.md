### Reasoning:

To solve the problem of maximizing the set of distinct Manhattan distances, we need to carefully consider how to place the `n` points in the `n x n` grid. The Manhattan distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by \(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\). To maximize the number of distinct distances, we need to ensure that the points are placed in a way that generates a wide variety of these distances.

The provided program places all points in the first row, specifically at positions \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((1, 3)\), ..., \((1, n)\). This strategy significantly limits the possible Manhattan distances because the x-coordinates are all the same, and the only variation comes from the y-coordinates. As a result, the distances are limited to the differences in the y-coordinates, which means the set of distinct Manhattan distances will be small.

For example, for \(n = 3\), the points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((1, 3)\). The possible Manhattan distances are:
- Between \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\): \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
- Between \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 3)\): \(|1-1| + |1-3| = 2\)
- Between \((1, 2)\) and \((1, 3)\): \(|1-1| + |2-3| = 1\)

Thus, the set of distinct Manhattan distances is \(\{0, 1, 2\}\). However, a better arrangement, such as \((2, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((3, 1)\), would yield the set \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has a larger size.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is correct in stating that the program does not maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances. The program is indeed incorrect because it fails to explore other configurations of points that could yield a larger set of distinct distances.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
