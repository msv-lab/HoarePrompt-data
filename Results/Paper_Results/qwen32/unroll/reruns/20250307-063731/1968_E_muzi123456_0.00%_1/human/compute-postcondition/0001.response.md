The `while` loop in the given code will execute as long as the condition `t` is truthy. In Python, any non-zero integer is considered truthy, and zero is considered falsy. Given that `t` is an integer read from input such that `1 <= t <= 50`, `t` will always be truthy because it will never be zero.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed to ensure that the loop executes the first time. The loop will definitely execute because `t` is guaranteed to be in the range 1 to 50.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 50**
