Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. The program simply outputs points in the first row of the grid, which results in a very limited set of Manhattan distances. For example, for \(n = 3\), the program outputs:

```
1 1
1 2
1 3
```

The only distinct Manhattan distances possible with these points are 0 (for the same point) and 1 (for adjacent points in the same row). However, as shown in the problem description, a better arrangement for \(n = 3\) could be:

```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```

This arrangement produces the set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which is larger than the set produced by the provided program. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all potential cases.
