Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. The program simply prints points along the first row of the grid, which does not maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances.

To maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances, a better strategy would be to distribute the points in a way that maximizes the differences in their coordinates. One possible approach is to place the points at coordinates that are as spread out as possible, such as along a diagonal or in a zigzag pattern.

Here is a corrected version of the program that places points in a zigzag pattern to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if i % 2 == 1:
                print('1', i)
            else:
                print(n, i)
        print(' ')

func()
```

This version places points alternately in the first and last rows, which helps to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances. However, even better strategies exist, such as placing points in a spiral pattern or other configurations that ensure a wide range of distances.
