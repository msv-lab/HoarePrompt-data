Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The task is to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of chosen cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The program simply prints points in the form (1, 1), (1, 2), ..., (1, n) for each test case. This arrangement does not maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

For example, consider the case where \(n = 3\). The program will output the points (1, 1), (1, 2), and (1, 3). The set of Manhattan distances will be \(\{0, 1, 2\}\), which is not optimal. An optimal arrangement for \(n = 3\) could be (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1), which results in the set of Manhattan distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).

Thus, the program does not produce the correct output for maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

Correctness: **False**
