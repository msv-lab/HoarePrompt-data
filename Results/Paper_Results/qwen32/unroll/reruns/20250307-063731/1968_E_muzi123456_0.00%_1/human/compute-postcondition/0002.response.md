To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the provided code snippet.

The initial state is defined by the variable `t`, which is an integer read from input and satisfies the condition 1 <= `t` <= 50. This variable `t` controls the number of times the outer `while` loop will execute.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. The `while t:` loop will run as long as `t` is not zero.
2. Inside the `while` loop, `t` is decremented by 1 (`t -= 1`).
3. For each iteration of the `while` loop, an integer `n` is read from the input.
4. A `for` loop then runs from 1 to `n` (inclusive). In each iteration of this loop:
   - The number `1` is printed, followed by a space.
   - The loop variable `i` (which ranges from 1 to `n`) is printed.
5. After the `for` loop completes, a space is printed.

The key point to note here is that the value of `t` is being decremented in each iteration of the `while` loop, and the loop will terminate when `t` becomes zero. The variable `n` is re-assigned in each iteration of the `while` loop based on the new input.

After all iterations of the `while` loop have finished, the value of `t` will be 0. The variable `n` will hold the value of the last integer read from the input, but since `n` is not preserved across iterations of the `while` loop, its final value is not relevant to the state of the program after the loop has completed. The state of other variables not affected by the loop remains unchanged.

Output State: **t is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is that the variable `t` will be 0 after all iterations of the loop have finished. The variable `n` will hold the value of the last integer read from the input, but this is not part of the output state since it is not preserved across iterations of the `while` loop.
