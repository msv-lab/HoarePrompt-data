### Reasoning:
The provided program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads an integer `n`. It then outputs `n` pairs of coordinates where the first coordinate of each pair is `1` and the second coordinate ranges from `1` to `n`. This means that all points are placed in the first row of an `n x n` grid.

The goal is to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of points. However, placing all points in the first row results in only one possible Manhattan distance (other than 0) for any pair of points: the absolute difference of their column indices. This is because the row indices are the same for all points, so the term `|x1 - x2|` is always `0` for any pair of points, and the Manhattan distance is simply `|y1 - y2|`.

This strategy does not maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances. For example, for `n=3`, placing points at `(1,1)`, `(1,2)`, and `(1,3)` results in Manhattan distances of `0`, `1`, and `2`, which is only 3 distinct values. However, a better arrangement could achieve more distinct distances.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances between the points. Therefore, the program is incorrect based on the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
