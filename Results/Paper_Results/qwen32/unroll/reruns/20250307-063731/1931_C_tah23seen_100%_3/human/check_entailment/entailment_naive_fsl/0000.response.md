Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal by applying the given operation at most once.

Let's analyze the logic and the problem description. The code attempts to find the longest contiguous segment of equal elements from the start and the end of the array and then calculates the minimum burles required based on these segments. However, this approach does not account for the optimal way to make the entire array equal with one operation.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 2 3 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation:**
To make all elements equal, we can choose `i = 1`, `j = 5`, and `x = 2`. This will change the array to `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` with a cost of `5 - 1 + 1 = 5` burles. However, a more optimal solution is to choose `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2`, which will change the array to `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]` with a cost of `4 - 2 + 1 = 3` burles. This is the minimum cost to make all elements equal.

The provided code does not consider such optimal segmentations and thus does not always produce the correct result. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
