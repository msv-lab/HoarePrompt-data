The function `func_1` processes a list of integers representing multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` indicating the size of the array, followed by `n` integers representing the elements of the array. For each test case, the function calculates and returns the maximum of two values: the maximum of `(j - i - 1, 0)` if the first and last elements of the array are the same, or the maximum of `0` and the minimum of `(n - i - 1)` and `j` if they are different. Here, `i` is the index of the first element from the start that is not the same as the one after it, and `j` is the index of the first element from the end that is not the same as the one before it.
