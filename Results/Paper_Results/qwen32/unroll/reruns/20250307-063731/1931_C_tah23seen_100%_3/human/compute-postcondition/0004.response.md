To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to analyze the given loop and initial state. The loop condition `while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` suggests that the loop will increment `i` as long as the current element and the next element in the list `arr` are equal.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list where the first element is the number of test cases `t`, followed by the sizes of the arrays and the array elements.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is the length of `arr`.
- `j` is `len(arr) - 1`.

The loop will stop when either:
1. `i` is no longer less than `len(arr) - 1`.
2. `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

Since the first element of `arr` is the number of test cases `t`, and the subsequent elements represent the sizes of the arrays and the array elements, the loop will not have any elements to compare that are equal unless the number of test cases `t` itself is repeated consecutively, which is not the typical case as per the problem description.

Given the problem constraints and typical input format, the loop will likely find that `arr[0]` (the number of test cases) is not equal to `arr[1]` (the size of the first array), so the loop will terminate immediately without incrementing `i`.

Therefore, the output state will be:
- `i` remains 0.
- `n` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **i=0, n=original length of arr, j=len(arr) - 1.**

In natural language, after the loop executes, the variable `i` will still be 0, and the variables `n` and `j` will retain their initial values as they were not modified by the loop.
