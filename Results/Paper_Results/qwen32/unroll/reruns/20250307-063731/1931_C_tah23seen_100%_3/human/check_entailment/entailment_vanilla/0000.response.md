Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have an array `a` of `n` integers.
- We can perform an operation once: select three integers `i`, `j`, `x` (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n) and assign all elements of the array with indexes from `i` to `j` the value `x`. The cost of this operation is `(j - i + 1)` burles.
- The goal is to find the least amount of burles needed to make all elements of the array equal.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it calls the function `func_1(arr)` with the array `arr` and prints the result.

#### Function `func_1(arr)`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0.
   - `n` is the length of the array.
   - `j` is initialized to `n - 1`.

2. **Finding the first segment of equal elements from the start**:
   - The while loop `while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:` increments `i` until it finds the first element that is not equal to the next one.
   - This loop effectively finds the length of the initial segment of equal elements from the start of the array.

3. **Finding the first segment of equal elements from the end**:
   - The while loop `while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:` decrements `j` until it finds the first element that is not equal to the previous one.
   - This loop effectively finds the length of the initial segment of equal elements from the end of the array.

4. **Determining the cost**:
   - If the first and last elements of the array are the same (`arr[0] == arr[-1]`), the function returns `max(j - i - 1, 0)`.
     - This means that if the array starts and ends with the same element, the cost is the length of the middle segment (if any) that needs to be changed.
   - Otherwise, it returns `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`.
     - This means that if the array does not start and end with the same element, the cost is determined by the minimum cost to change either the start or the end segment to match the other.

### Correctness Analysis:
The function `func_1(arr)` seems to be attempting to find the minimum cost to make all elements in the array equal by considering the start and end segments of equal elements. However, the logic is flawed for several reasons:

1. **Handling of Single Element Arrays**:
   - If the array has only one element, the cost should be 0, which is correctly handled by the function.

2. **Handling of Uniform Arrays**:
   - If the entire array is already uniform, the cost should be 0, which is correctly handled by the function.

3. **Handling of Non-Uniform Arrays**:
   - The function only considers changing the start or end segment to match the other. It does not consider the possibility of changing a middle segment to make the entire array uniform.
   - For example, in the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the function will return `4`, but the optimal solution is to change the middle segment `[2, 3, 4, 5]` to `1`, which costs `4` burles. However, the function does not consider this and instead considers changing the entire array except the first element to `1`, which costs `5` burles.

4. **General Case**:
   - The function does not correctly compute the minimum cost for all possible cases. It only considers a limited set of operations.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not guarantee the correct minimum cost for all possible input arrays. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
