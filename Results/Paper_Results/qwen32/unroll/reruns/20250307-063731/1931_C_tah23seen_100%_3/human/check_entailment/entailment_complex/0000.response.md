### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by identifying the longest contiguous segments at the beginning and end of the array that contain the same element. It then uses these segments to determine the minimal cost of making the entire array uniform using a single operation.

However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed. Here's why:

1. **Initialization of `i` and `j`**:
   - `i` is initialized to the first index where consecutive elements differ.
   - `j` is initialized to the last index where consecutive elements differ from the previous one.

2. **Logic when `arr[0] == arr[-1]`**:
   - If the first and last elements are the same, the function returns `max(j - i - 1, 0)`. This is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility that the array can be made uniform without changing any elements if the entire array is already uniform.

3. **Logic when `arr[0] != arr[-1]`**:
   - If the first and last elements are different, the function returns `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`. This is also incorrect because it does not correctly account for the minimal cost of making the array uniform. It fails to consider cases where the minimal cost might involve changing a segment in the middle of the array.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
