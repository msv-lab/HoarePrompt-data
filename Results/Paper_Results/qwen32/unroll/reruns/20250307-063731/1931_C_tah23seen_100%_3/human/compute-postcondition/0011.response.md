Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers representing multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` indicating the size of the array, followed by `n` integers representing the elements of the array. For each test case, the function calculates and returns the maximum of two values: the first value is the maximum of `(j - i - 1, 0)` and the second value is the maximum of `0` and the minimum of `(n - i - 1)` and `j`.**
