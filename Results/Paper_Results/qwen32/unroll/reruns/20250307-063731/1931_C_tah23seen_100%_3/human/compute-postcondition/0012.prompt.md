You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the size of the array for a test case, followed by the array elements which are integers in the range [1, n] for each test case. The first element of arr is the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, the first integer is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), the size of the array, and the next n integers are the elements of the array. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    n = len(arr)
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: i=0, n=original length of arr, j=len(arr) - 1.
    while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
        j -= 1
        
    #State: i=0, n=original length of arr, j=index of the first element from the end that is not the same as the one before it.
    if (arr[0] == arr[-1]) :
        return max(j - i - 1, 0)
        #The program returns the maximum of (j - i - 1, 0)
    #State: i=0, n=original length of arr, j=index of the first element from the end that is not the same as the one before it, and the first element of arr is not the same as the last element of arr
    return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)
    #The program returns the maximum of 0 and the minimum of (n - i - 1) and j
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers representing multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` indicating the size of the array, followed by `n` integers representing the elements of the array. For each test case, the function calculates and returns the maximum of two values: the first value is the maximum of `(j - i - 1, 0)` and the second value is the maximum of `0` and the minimum of `(n - i - 1)` and `j`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the maximum of (j - i - 1, 0)

Case_2: The program returns the maximum of 0 and the minimum of (n - i - 1) and j


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
