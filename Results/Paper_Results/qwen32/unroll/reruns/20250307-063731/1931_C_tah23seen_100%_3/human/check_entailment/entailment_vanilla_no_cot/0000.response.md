Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_1` is not adequate to determine the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal with at most one operation. The current approach only checks the longest contiguous segments of the same number at the start and end of the array and returns a value based on that, which is insufficient to handle all cases.

Here's a brief explanation of why the current approach is incorrect:

- It does not consider cases where the optimal solution involves changing a segment in the middle of the array.
- It does not account for scenarios where the optimal solution involves changing the entire array.
- It does not handle cases where multiple different numbers are present in the array and the optimal strategy involves changing a segment in a way that minimizes the cost.

A correct solution would involve checking all possible segments and calculating the cost of changing each segment to a single value, but given the constraints, a more efficient approach is needed, such as using dynamic programming or a greedy strategy that considers all possible splits of the array into two parts and calculates the cost of making each part uniform.
