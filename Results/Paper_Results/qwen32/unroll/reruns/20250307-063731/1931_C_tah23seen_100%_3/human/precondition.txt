arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the size of the array for a test case followed by the array elements themselves. The first element of arr is the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, the first element is the size of the array n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and the next n elements are the array elements a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
