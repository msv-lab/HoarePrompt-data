Reasoning: The provided program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements of an array equal by performing at most one operation of assigning a value to a subarray. However, the implementation of the `func_1` function does not correctly address the problem requirements.

Let's break down the problem and the function:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We can perform at most one operation of setting a subarray to a specific value, and the cost of this operation is the length of the subarray.
   - We need to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` appears to be trying to find the longest contiguous segment of equal elements from the start and end of the array.
   - It then calculates the minimum cost based on the positions of these segments.
   - However, the logic does not correctly account for the minimum cost to make the entire array equal with at most one operation.

3. **Issues in the Function**:
   - The function does not consider all possible subarrays that could be set to a single value to minimize the cost.
   - It only considers setting the entire array to the value of the first segment or the last segment, which might not be optimal.
   - For example, in the case of an array like `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the function would incorrectly return `4` (cost to make the array `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` by setting the middle part to `1`), whereas the correct answer is `4` (cost to make the array `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` by setting the middle part to `1` or `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]` by setting the middle part to `5`).

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - A correct approach would involve checking all possible values that could be used to fill the array and calculating the minimum cost for each.
   - This could be done by counting the frequency of each element and calculating the cost to make the entire array equal to each element.

Given the above reasoning, the provided function does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
