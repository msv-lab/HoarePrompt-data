Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the size of the array for a test case, followed by the array elements which are integers in the range [1, n] for each test case. The first element of `arr` is the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4). For each test case, the first integer is `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), the size of the array, and the next `n` integers are the elements of the array. The sum of `n` for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `i` is 0.**

In simpler terms, the list `arr` remains unchanged, and the variable `i` is set to 0.
