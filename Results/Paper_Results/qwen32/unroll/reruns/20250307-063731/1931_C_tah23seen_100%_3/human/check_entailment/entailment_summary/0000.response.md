Reasoning:
The provided Python program attempts to solve the problem by identifying the longest contiguous segment of the same elements from both ends of the array and then determining the minimum cost based on the identified segments. However, the logic in `func_1` does not correctly address the problem's requirements.

The given problem asks for the minimum cost to make all elements in the array equal, where the cost is defined as the length of the segment being replaced. The provided function does not consider all possible segments that can be replaced to achieve uniformity across the array. Instead, it only considers segments from the start and end that are already uniform, which is not sufficient to guarantee the minimum cost.

For example, consider the input `[4, 3, 2, 7, 1, 1, 3]`. The function will identify `i` as 0 and `j` as 6, and since `arr[0]` is not equal to `arr[-1]`, it will return `max(0, min(6, 6)) = 6`. However, the optimal solution involves changing the middle segment `[3, 2, 7, 1]` to any other number, which would cost 4 burles, making the array uniform.

Thus, the function does not correctly compute the least amount of burles needed to make all elements of the array equal.

Correctness: **False**
