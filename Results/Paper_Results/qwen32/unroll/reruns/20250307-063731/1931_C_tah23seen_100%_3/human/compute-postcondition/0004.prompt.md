Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the size of the array for a test case, followed by the array elements which are integers in the range [1, n] for each test case. The first element of `arr` is the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4). For each test case, the first integer is `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), the size of the array, and the next `n` integers are the elements of the array. The sum of `n` for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `i` is 0. `n` is the length of `arr`. `j` is `len(arr) - 1`.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
    i += 1



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
