To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's analyze the provided code and initial state.

**Initial State:**
- `i = 0`
- `n = original length of arr`
- `j = len(arr) - 1`

**Loop Code:**
```python
while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
    j -= 1
```

The loop continues to execute as long as `j` is greater than 0 and the element at index `j` is equal to the element at index `j - 1`. In each iteration, `j` is decremented by 1.

**Output State:**
- `i` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- `j` will be decremented until it either reaches 0 or `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[j - 1]`.

**Explanation in Natural Language:**
The loop will keep moving `j` backwards through the array as long as the current element (`arr[j]`) is the same as the previous element (`arr[j - 1]`). Once it finds an element that is different from the one before it, or if `j` reaches 0, the loop will stop. The final value of `j` will be the index of the first element from the end of the array that is not the same as the one before it.

**Output State: **i=0, n=original length of arr, j=index of the first element from the end that is not the same as the one before it.**
