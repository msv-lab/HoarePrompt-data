### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its function summary to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to maximize the total difference \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \) where \( c_i \) is constructed from \( b_i \) by choosing \( n \) elements and arranging them in any order.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Sorting Array \( b \)**:
   - The array \( b \) is sorted to facilitate finding the smallest and largest possible differences.
   - This step is correct and necessary.

2. **Using a Max-Heap**:
   - The max-heap is used to keep track of the largest possible differences for each element in \( a \).
   - For each element in \( a \), the program calculates the absolute differences with the smallest and largest elements in \( b \) and pushes the larger difference into the heap.
   - This step ensures that we consider the largest possible differences first.

3. **Heap Operations**:
   - The program repeatedly pops the largest difference from the heap and checks if the corresponding element in \( b \) (either the smallest or largest) has already been used.
   - If the element has been used, it recalculates the next best difference using the remaining elements in \( b \).
   - The pointers `tp1` and `tp2` are updated to ensure that the smallest and largest unused elements in \( b \) are considered.

4. **Updating Pointers**:
   - The pointers `tp1` and `tp2` are correctly updated to ensure that elements from \( b \) are not reused unnecessarily.

5. **Summing Up Differences**:
   - The total difference is accumulated and printed for each test case.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary states that the function calculates and outputs the minimum possible sum of absolute differences. This is incorrect according to the problem description, which requires maximizing the sum of absolute differences.

#### Correctness:
- The logic for maximizing the differences is correct.
- However, the function summary is inaccurate, as it describes the function as minimizing differences instead of maximizing them.
- The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem, despite the incorrect function summary.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
