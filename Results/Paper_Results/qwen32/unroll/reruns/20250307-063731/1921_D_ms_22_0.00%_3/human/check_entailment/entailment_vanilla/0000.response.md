### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to maximize the total difference \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \) between two arrays, where \( c_i \) is constructed from \( b_i \) by choosing \( n \) elements and arranging them in any order.

The provided program implements a strategy to achieve this:
1. **Sorting the array \( b \)**: The array \( b \) is sorted to facilitate the selection of the largest and smallest possible differences.
2. **Using a max-heap**: A max-heap (priority queue) is used to keep track of the largest possible differences for each element in \( a \). This is done by comparing the absolute differences between each element in \( a \) and the smallest and largest elements in \( b \).
3. **Heap operations**: The heap is used to repeatedly select the largest difference. If the selected element from \( b \) (either the smallest or largest) has already been used up (tracked by `tp1` and `tp2`), it recalculates the next best difference using the remaining elements in \( b \).
4. **Updating pointers**: The pointers `tp1` and `tp2` are updated to ensure that the smallest and largest unused elements in \( b \) are considered for the next comparison.
5. **Summing up differences**: The total difference is accumulated and printed for each test case.

### Correctness:

The approach is correct because:
- Sorting \( b \) allows us to efficiently find the smallest and largest possible differences.
- Using a max-heap ensures that we always consider the largest possible difference first, maximizing the total difference \( D \).
- The logic for updating the pointers `tp1` and `tp2` ensures that we do not reuse elements from \( b \) unnecessarily, maintaining the integrity of the selection process.
- The program correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the maximum difference for each.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness is:

Correctness: **True**
