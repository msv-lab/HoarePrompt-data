Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= `m` <= 2 * 10^5; `a_i` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^9; The sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to an integer input value between 1 and 100. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `a_i`, `b_i`) and their constraints remain unchanged as the code snippet only affects `t`.
