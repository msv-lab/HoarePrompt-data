To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to verify whether it correctly computes the maximum total difference \( D \) for each test case as described in the problem statement.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Parsing and Sorting**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( m \), the arrays \( a \) and \( b \).
   - The array \( b \) is sorted.

2. **Heap Initialization**:
   - A max-heap is used to keep track of the largest possible differences for each element in \( a \) when compared to the smallest and largest elements in \( b \).

3. **Heap Population**:
   - For each element \( i \) in \( a \), the program calculates the absolute differences with the smallest (\( b[0] \)) and largest (\( b[m-1] \)) elements in \( b \).
   - The larger difference is pushed onto the heap (negated to simulate a max-heap using Python's `heapq`).

4. **Maximizing Difference Calculation**:
   - The program pops elements from the heap and calculates the total difference \( D \).
   - It ensures that each element in \( b \) is used at most once by maintaining two pointers (`tp1` and `tp2`) that track the smallest and largest elements in \( b \) that haven't been used yet.
   - If the current element from the heap refers to an already used index, it recalculates the best possible difference using the remaining elements in \( b \).

### Correctness Verification

The program's approach is sound and follows the strategy of maximizing the difference by always choosing the largest possible differences for each element in \( a \). The use of a heap ensures that the largest potential contributions to \( D \) are considered first, and the two-pointer technique ensures that each element in \( b \) is used optimally.

### Conclusion

Given the problem's constraints and the described approach, the program appears to be correct. It efficiently computes the maximum total difference \( D \) for each test case.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
