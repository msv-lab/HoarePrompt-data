For the given task, the `while` loop will execute as long as the condition `t > 0` is true. The variable `t` is described as an input integer such that `1 <= t <= 100`.

Since `t` is guaranteed to be at least 1 and at most 100, the condition `t > 0` will always be true for the initial state provided. Therefore, no adjustment is needed to ensure that the loop can execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= `m` <= 2 * 10^5; `a_i` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^9; The sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
