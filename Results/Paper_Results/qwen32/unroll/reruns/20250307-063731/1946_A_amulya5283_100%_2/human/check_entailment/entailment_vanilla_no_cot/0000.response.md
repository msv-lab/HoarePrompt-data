Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Here's why:

1. **Single Element Array**: The program outputs `1` for a single-element array, which is incorrect. The median of a single-element array is the element itself, and it cannot be increased by any operation.

2. **Median Calculation**: The program calculates the median index `mdx` correctly as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, but the logic to determine the number of operations is flawed.

3. **Counting Operations**: The program increments the result `res` for every element equal to the median, which does not correctly determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median. Instead, the program should focus on the smallest elements that need to be increased to surpass the current median.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        if n == 1:
            print(1)  # This is incorrect; should be 0 since the median cannot be increased
        else:
            mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1
            current_median = a[mdx]
            target_median = current_median + 1
            res = 0
            i = 0
            while a[i] < target_median and res < n // 2 + n % 2:
                res += target_median - a[i]
                i += 1
            print(res)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

In the corrected version:
- For a single-element array, the correct output should be `0` because the median cannot be increased.
- The program calculates the current median and the target median (one more than the current median).
- It then counts the number of operations required to increase the smallest elements until the median is increased.
