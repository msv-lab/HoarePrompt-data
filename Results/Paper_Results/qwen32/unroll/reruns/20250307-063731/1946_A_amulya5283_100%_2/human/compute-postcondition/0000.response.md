Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and `a` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) for each test case. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to the integer value obtained from the input, representing the number of test cases. The other variables `n` and `a` remain as described in the initial state, as the provided code snippet only affects `t`.
