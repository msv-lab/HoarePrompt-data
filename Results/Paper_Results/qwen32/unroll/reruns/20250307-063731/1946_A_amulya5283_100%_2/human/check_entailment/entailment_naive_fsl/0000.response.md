Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided code does not correctly determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Sorting the Array:** 
   - The code correctly sorts the array to find the median.

2. **Handling the Median Index:**
   - The code calculates the median index `mdx` correctly using `mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.

3. **Counting Operations:**
   - The code then counts how many elements from the median index to the end of the array are equal to the median value. This count is stored in `res`.
   - However, this count does not represent the minimum number of operations required to increase the median. Instead, it counts the number of elements that are equal to the current median.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to determine how many elements need to be incremented such that the median value increases. This involves:

- Identifying the median value.
- Incrementing the smallest elements necessary to ensure that the median value in the sorted array increases.

Let's consider an example where the current code fails:

**Example:**
```
Input:
1
3
1 1 1

Output:
2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation of the Failure:**
- The current code will calculate the median index as `1` (since `n=3`), and the median value as `1`.
- It will count the number of elements equal to `1` from index `1` to the end, which is `2`.
- However, to increase the median from `1` to `2`, we only need to increment one element (either of the first two `1`s), not two.

Thus, the provided code does not correctly determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
