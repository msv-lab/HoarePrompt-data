To determine the output state after the loop finishes, we need to understand how the loop iterates and modifies the output based on the given initial state and the loop code.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5.
- `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000.
- `s` is a new string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `win` is an empty set.
- `ans` is a list containing every `k`-th character of `s`, repeated `m // k` times.
- `ps` is `m // k` and `ps` is less than `n`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in us:
    if i not in win:
        print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iteration**: The loop iterates over each character in the set `us`, which contains the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. **Condition Check**: For each character `i` in `us`, the loop checks if `i` is not in the set `win`. Initially, `win` is an empty set, so this condition will always be true for the first iteration.
3. **Output Construction**:
   - `ans` is a list of characters constructed from `s` by taking every `k`-th character and repeating it `m // k` times.
   - `''.join(ans)` converts the list `ans` into a string.
   - `i` is the current character from `us`.
   - `'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1)` adds the necessary number of 'a' characters to make the total length of the string equal to `n`.

### Output Generation:
- For each character `i` in `us`, the loop prints a string that consists of:
  - The characters in `ans` joined into a string.
  - The character `i`.
  - Sufficient 'a' characters to make the total length of the string `n`.

### Final Output State:
- The final output state involves the printed strings for each character in `us`.
- The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, `win`, `ans`, and `ps` remain unchanged as per the problem statement.

### Output State:
Output State: **The loop prints a string for each character in `us` in the format `''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1)`, where `i` is each character from the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, `win`, `ans`, and `ps` remain unchanged.**
