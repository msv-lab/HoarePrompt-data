#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5. For each test case, n, k, and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000. s is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.
def func_1():
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()

    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is the new string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is an empty set; `ans` is a list containing every `k`-th character of `s`, repeated `m // k` times; `ps` is `m // k`.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a new string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is an empty set; `ans` is a list containing every `k`-th character of `s`, repeated `m // k` times; `ps` is `m // k` and `ps` is less than `n`.

        if i not in win:
            print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: The loop prints a string for each character in `us` in the format `''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1)`, where `i` is each character from the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, `win`, `ans`, and `ps` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input values for `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. It checks if the string `s` contains all `k` unique characters in a sequence at least `n` times. If this condition is met, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and then prints additional strings based on the characters not found in the sequence.
