Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\).
- `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 26\), \(1 \leq k \leq 26\), and \(1 \leq m \leq 1000\).
- `s` is a new string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `win` is an empty set.
- `ans` is a list containing every `k`-th character of `s`, repeated `m // k` times.
- `ps` is `m // k` and `ps` is less than `n`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement is straightforward. It prints the string `'NO'`. The variables and their values described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific print statement because the print statement does not reference any of these variables. It simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

### Output:
Output: **NO**
