Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a new string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is an empty set; `ans` is a list containing every `k`-th character of `s`, repeated `m // k` times; `ps` is `m // k` and `ps` is less than `n`.**
