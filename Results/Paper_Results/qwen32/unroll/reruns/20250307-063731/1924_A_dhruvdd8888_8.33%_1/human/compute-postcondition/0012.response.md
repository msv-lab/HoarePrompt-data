The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the set `us`. Therefore, the state of `us` needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute. Specifically, `us` must contain at least one element for the loop to start executing.

Given the initial state, `us` is defined as a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. Since `k` is at least 1, `us` will always contain at least one element. Thus, no adjustment to `us` is necessary to ensure the loop can execute.

However, we need to ensure that `i` is correctly set to the first element of `us` at the start of the loop. Since the loop body is omitted, we can assume that the loop will execute correctly as long as `us` is non-empty.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a new string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is an empty set; `ans` is a list containing every `k`-th character of `s`, repeated `m // k` times; `ps` is `m // k` and `ps` is less than `n`. `i` is the first element of `us`**
