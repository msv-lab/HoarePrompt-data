The provided code snippet reads a new string `s` from the input, which replaces the existing value of `s`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is the new string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.**
