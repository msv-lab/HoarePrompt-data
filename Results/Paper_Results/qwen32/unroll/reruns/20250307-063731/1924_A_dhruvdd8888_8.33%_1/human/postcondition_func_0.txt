The function reads input values for `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. It checks if the string `s` contains all `k` unique characters in a sequence at least `n` times. If this condition is met, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and then prints additional strings based on the characters not found in the sequence.
