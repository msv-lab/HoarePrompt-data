The code provided reads a line of input and splits it into three integers, which are then assigned to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m`. The other variables (`t`, `s`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.**
