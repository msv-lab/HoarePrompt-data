You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input values for `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. It checks if the string `s` contains all `k` unique characters in a sequence at least `n` times. If this condition is met, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and then prints additional strings based on the characters not found in the sequence.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly check whether all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.

Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Subsequence Checking**:
   - The code attempts to check subsequences by maintaining a set `win` of characters found in the string `s`. However, this approach does not correctly handle the order of characters or ensure that all possible combinations of length `n` are checked.
   
2. **Logic for Forming Subsequences**:
   - The code does not generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`. Instead, it attempts to build a sequence from `s` and checks if it meets the required length, which is not the correct approach.

3. **Generating Missing Subsequence**:
   - The code attempts to generate a missing subsequence by appending characters to `ans` and then adding an 'a' to fill the remaining length. However, this does not guarantee that the generated string is a valid missing subsequence.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following input:
```
1
2 2 4
abba
```

The program should output `YES` because all possible strings of length 2 using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets (`aa`, `ab`, `ba`, `bb`) are subsequences of `abba`.

However, the program might incorrectly output `NO` and a string like `aa` because it does not correctly check all possible subsequences.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
1. Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. Check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.
3. If any string is not found, output `NO` and the missing string.
4. If all strings are found, output `YES`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import product

def is_subsequence(s, t):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(c in it for c in t)

def solve():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        alphabet = ''.join(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
        all_strings = [''.join(p) for p in product(alphabet, repeat=n)]
        found_all = True
        missing_string = ""
        for string in all_strings:
            if not is_subsequence(s, string):
                found_all = False
                missing_string = string
                break
        if found_all:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")
            print(missing_string)

solve()
```

This corrected version correctly generates all possible strings of length `n` and checks if each is a subsequence of `s`, ensuring the problem requirements are met in all cases.
