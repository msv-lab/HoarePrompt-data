The provided code snippet creates a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged. The only variable that is modified is `us`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is the new string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.**
