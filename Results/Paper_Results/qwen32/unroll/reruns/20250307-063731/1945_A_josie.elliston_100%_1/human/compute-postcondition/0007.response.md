Functionality: **The function accepts two non-negative integer parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`. It returns `None` if `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of `extroverts % 3` and `universals` is less than 3. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3.**
