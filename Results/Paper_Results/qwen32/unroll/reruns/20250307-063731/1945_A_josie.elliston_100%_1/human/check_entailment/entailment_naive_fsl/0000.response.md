Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all cases correctly. Let's examine the logic:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, it checks if the sum of extroverts and universals is less than 3. If so, it returns `None` indicating it's impossible to accommodate them.
   - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3, which represents the number of tents needed.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the total number of tents required.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns -1 indicating it's impossible to accommodate the participants.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts and the result from `func_1`.

### Issues:
- **Handling Universals**: The code does not correctly handle the allocation of universals to tents when extroverts are not a multiple of 3. It only checks if the sum of extroverts and universals is less than 3, which is too restrictive. There could be cases where universals can be used to fill up the remaining spots in the tents.
- **Edge Cases**: The code does not consider cases where universals can be used optimally to fill tents. For example, if there are 2 extroverts and 1 universal, the code will return `None` because 2 is not a multiple of 3, but in reality, they can share a tent.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the case `a=1`, `b=2`, `c=1`:
- According to the problem, 1 tent is needed for the introvert, and the 2 extroverts and 1 universal can share 1 tent. So, the total number of tents needed is 2.
- However, the provided code will return 3 because it calculates the number of tents for extroverts and universals as `ceil((2+1)/3) = 1` and then adds the tent for the introvert, resulting in 2 tents. But it does not handle the case where extroverts and universals can share a tent correctly.

### Correct Approach:
The correct approach would be to:
1. Allocate tents for introverts (1 tent per introvert).
2. Allocate tents for extroverts (3 per tent).
3. Use universals to fill up any remaining spots in the tents for extroverts.
4. If there are still extroverts left who cannot be accommodated (i.e., the number of extroverts modulo 3 is not zero), check if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots.
5. If there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots, return -1.

Given the above issues, the provided code is incorrect.
