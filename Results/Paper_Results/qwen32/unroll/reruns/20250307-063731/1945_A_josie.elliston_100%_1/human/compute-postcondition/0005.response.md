Output State: **The program returns the ceiling of the division of (extroverts + universals) by 3**

Given the conditions:
- `extroverts` and `universals` are non-negative integers.
- If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, then `extroverts % 3 + universals` is 3 or greater.

The program calculates `(extroverts + universals) / 3` and applies the `ceil` function to the result. The `ceil` function rounds the result up to the nearest integer. Therefore, the final output will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `(extroverts + universals) / 3`.
