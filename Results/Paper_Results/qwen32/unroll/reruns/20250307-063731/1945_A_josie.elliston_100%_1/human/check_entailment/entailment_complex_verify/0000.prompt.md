You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

for _ in range(test_case_n):
    (introverts, extroverts, universals) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    print(func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: extroverts and universals are non-negative integers.
def func_1(extroverts, universals):
    if (extroverts % 3 != 0) :
        if (extroverts % 3 + universals < 3) :
            return None
            #The program returns None
        #State: `extroverts` and `universals` are non-negative integers. The current value of `extroverts` is not divisible by 3. The sum of `extroverts % 3` and `universals` is 3 or greater.
    #State: `extroverts` and `universals` are non-negative integers. If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, the sum of `extroverts % 3` and `universals` is 3 or greater.
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)
    #The program returns the ceiling of the division of (extroverts + universals) by 3
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integer parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`. It returns `None` if `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of `extroverts % 3` and `universals` is less than 3. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: introverts, extroverts, and universals are non-negative integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals respectively.
def func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals):
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret
    #The program returns -1 if `ret` is None; otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and `ret`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes three non-negative integer parameters representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. It returns -1 if the result from an internal computation (`func_1`) is `None`; otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts and the result from the internal computation.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all cases correctly. Let's examine the logic:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, it checks if the sum of extroverts and universals is less than 3. If so, it returns `None` indicating it's impossible to accommodate them.
   - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3, which represents the number of tents needed.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the total number of tents required.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns -1 indicating it's impossible to accommodate the participants.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts and the result from `func_1`.

### Issues:
- **Handling Universals**: The code does not correctly handle the allocation of universals to tents when extroverts are not a multiple of 3. It only checks if the sum of extroverts and universals is less than 3, which is too restrictive. There could be cases where universals can be used to fill up the remaining spots in the tents.
- **Edge Cases**: The code does not consider cases where universals can be used optimally to fill tents. For example, if there are 2 extroverts and 1 universal, the code will return `None` because 2 is not a multiple of 3, but in reality, they can share a tent.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the case `a=1`, `b=2`, `c=1`:
- According to the problem, 1 tent is needed for the introvert, and the 2 extroverts and 1 universal can share 1 tent. So, the total number of tents needed is 2.
- However, the provided code will return 3 because it calculates the number of tents for extroverts and universals as `ceil((2+1)/3) = 1` and then adds the tent for the introvert, resulting in 2 tents. But it does not handle the case where extroverts and universals can share a tent correctly.

### Correct Approach:
The correct approach would be to:
1. Allocate tents for introverts (1 tent per introvert).
2. Allocate tents for extroverts (3 per tent).
3. Use universals to fill up any remaining spots in the tents for extroverts.
4. If there are still extroverts left who cannot be accommodated (i.e., the number of extroverts modulo 3 is not zero), check if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots.
5. If there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots, return -1.

Given the above issues, the provided code is incorrect.
