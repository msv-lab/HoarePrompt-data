Reasoning:
The problem requires calculating the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate introverts, extroverts, and universals based on their preferences. Let's break down the provided functions and see if they meet the problem's requirements.

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function calculates the number of tents required for extroverts and universals. It first checks if the number of extroverts is divisible by 3. If not, it checks if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) plus the number of universals is at least 3, which would allow filling up the last tent. If not, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it calculates the number of tents needed by taking the ceiling of the division of the sum of extroverts and universals by 3.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function calculates the total number of tents required for all participants. It uses `func_1` to determine the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals. If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals according to their preferences, so `func_2` returns -1. Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1` and returns the sum.

Let's verify if the functions meet the problem requirements:

1. **Handling Introverts**: Each introvert needs a separate tent. Thus, the number of tents for introverts is simply the number of introverts.
2. **Handling Extroverts**: Extroverts need to be in tents with two others. If the number of extroverts is divisible by 3, they can all be accommodated in `extroverts / 3` tents. If not, the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) need to be paired with universals to fill up the last tent. The function `func_1` handles this correctly.
3. **Handling Universals**: Universals can be used to fill up the last tent if there are remaining extroverts that need to be paired. The function `func_1` handles this by checking if the sum of the remaining extroverts and universals is at least 3.
4. **Returning -1**: If it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals according to their preferences, the function should return -1. This is correctly handled by returning `None` from `func_1` and checking for `None` in `func_2`.

Given the above analysis, both functions correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
