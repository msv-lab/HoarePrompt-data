### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program using the annotations and the problem description.

#### Function `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`:
- **Purpose**: Calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
- **Logic**:
  1. If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 (`extroverts % 3 != 0`), it checks if the remaining extroverts and universals can form a tent together (`extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`). If not, it returns `None`.
  2. If the extroverts can form complete groups of 3, or the remaining extroverts and universals can form a tent, it calculates the total number of tents required using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

#### Function `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`:
- **Purpose**: Calculate the total number of tents needed for introverts, extroverts, and universals.
- **Logic**:
  1. Uses `func_1` to get the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
  2. If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate all extroverts and universals according to their preferences, so it returns `-1`.
  3. Otherwise, it adds the number of tents needed for introverts (which is equal to the number of introverts since each introvert needs a tent alone) to the number of tents returned by `func_1` and returns the total.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations confirm the state of the program at key points and the logic of the functions.
- For `func_1`:
  - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it correctly checks if `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3` to determine if a tent can be formed.
  - If the condition is not met, it returns `None`.
  - Otherwise, it calculates the number of tents using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.
- For `func_2`:
  - It correctly calls `func_1` and checks if the result is `None`.
  - If `None`, it returns `-1`.
  - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1` and returns the total.

#### Verification with Test Cases:
- The original assessment verified the test cases correctly.
- Each test case aligns with the problem description and the logic of the functions.

### Conclusion
The annotations and the logic of the functions match the problem description and the test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final: True**
