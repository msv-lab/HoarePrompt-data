You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program:
from math import ceil
from typing import Optional
#Function 1:
def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if extroverts % 3 != 0:
        if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3:
            return None
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

#Function 2:
def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function takes three non-negative integer parameters representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. It returns -1 if the result from an internal computation (`func_1`) is `None`; otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts and the result from the internal computation.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze the logic implemented in the functions `func_1` and `func_2` to ensure they correctly calculate the minimum number of tents required based on the given constraints.

### Analysis

1. **Function `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`:**
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for the extroverts and the universals.
   - If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, it checks if the remaining extroverts and universals can form a tent together. If not, it returns `None`.
   - If the extroverts can form complete groups of 3, or the remaining extroverts and universals can form a tent, it calculates the total number of tents required using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

2. **Function `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`:**
   - This function uses `func_1` to get the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate all extroverts and universals according to their preferences, so it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of tents needed for introverts (which is equal to the number of introverts since each introvert needs a tent alone) to the number of tents returned by `func_1` and returns the total.

### Verification

Let's verify the logic with the example test cases provided:

1. **Test case 1: (1, 2, 3)**
   - `func_1(2, 3)` returns `ceil((2 + 3) / 3) = ceil(5 / 3) = 2` (since 2 extroverts and 3 universals can form 1 tent with 3 people and 1 tent with 2 people).
   - `func_2(1, 2, 3)` returns `1 + 2 = 3`.

2. **Test case 2: (1, 4, 1)**
   - `func_1(4, 1)` returns `None` (since 4 extroverts cannot form complete groups of 3, and 4 extroverts + 1 universal cannot form a tent together).
   - `func_2(1, 4, 1)` returns `-1`.

3. **Test case 3: (1, 4, 2)**
   - `func_1(4, 2)` returns `ceil((4 + 2) / 3) = ceil(6 / 3) = 2` (since 4 extroverts and 2 universals can form 2 tents with 3 people each).
   - `func_2(1, 4, 2)` returns `1 + 2 = 3`.

4. **Test case 4: (1, 1, 1)**
   - `func_1(1, 1)` returns `None` (since 1 extrovert cannot form a complete group of 3, and 1 extrovert + 1 universal cannot form a tent together).
   - `func_2(1, 1, 1)` returns `-1`.

5. **Test case 5: (1, 3, 2)**
   - `func_1(3, 2)` returns `ceil((3 + 2) / 3) = ceil(5 / 3) = 2` (since 3 extroverts can form 1 tent with 3 people, and 2 universals can form 1 tent with 2 people).
   - `func_2(1, 3, 2)` returns `1 + 2 = 3`.

6. **Test case 6: (19, 7, 18)**
   - `func_1(7, 18)` returns `ceil((7 + 18) / 3) = ceil(25 / 3) = 9` (since 7 extroverts and 18 universals can form 9 tents with 3 people each).
   - `func_2(19, 7, 18)` returns `19 + 9 = 28`.

7. **Test case 7: (0, 0, 0)**
   - `func_1(0, 0)` returns `ceil((0 + 0) / 3) = ceil(0 / 3) = 0`.
   - `func_2(0, 0, 0)` returns `0 + 0 = 0`.

8. **Test case 8: (7, 0, 0)**
   - `func_1(0, 0)` returns `ceil((0 + 0) / 3) = ceil(0 / 3) = 0`.
   - `func_2(7, 0, 0)` returns `7 + 0 = 7`.

9. **Test case 9: (0, 24, 0)**
   - `func_1(24, 0)` returns `ceil((24 + 0) / 3) = ceil(24 / 3) = 8` (since 24 extroverts can form 8 tents with 3 people each).
   - `func_2(0, 24, 0)` returns `0 + 8 = 8`.

10. **Test case 10: (1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000)**
    - `func_1(1000000000, 1000000000)` returns `ceil((1000000000 + 1000000000) / 3) = ceil(2000000000 / 3) = 666666667` (since 1000000000 extroverts and 1000000000 universals can form 666666667 tents with 3 people each).
    - `func_2(1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000)` returns `1000000000 + 666666667 = 1666666667`.
