### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to ensure that the functions `func_1` and `func_2` together meet the requirements of the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is responsible for calculating the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - It returns `None` if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and the sum of `extroverts % 3` and `universals` is less than 3. This is because an extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two others, and if the remaining extroverts after forming groups of three cannot be paired with enough universals, it's impossible to accommodate them.
   - If the condition above is not met, it returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3. This ensures that any remaining extroverts and universals are placed in the minimum number of tents.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the total number of tents needed by summing the number of introverts and the result from `func_1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals according to their preferences, so `func_2` returns -1.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts and the result from `func_1`, which gives the total number of tents needed.

### Verification:

Let's verify the functions with the provided examples:

- **Example 1**: `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `c = 3`
  - `func_1(2, 3)` calculates the number of tents needed for 2 extroverts and 3 universals. `2 % 3` is 2, and `2 + 3` is 5, which is >= 3. So, it returns `ceil((2 + 3) / 3) = 2`.
  - `func_2(1, 2, 3)` returns `1 + 2 = 3`.

- **Example 2**: `a = 1`, `b = 4`, `c = 1`
  - `func_1(4, 1)` calculates the number of tents needed for 4 extroverts and 1 universal. `4 % 3` is 1, and `1 + 1` is 2, which is < 3. So, it returns `None`.
  - `func_2(1, 4, 1)` returns `-1`.

- **Example 3**: `a = 1`, `b = 4`, `c = 2`
  - `func_1(4, 2)` calculates the number of tents needed for 4 extroverts and 2 universals. `4 % 3` is 1, and `1 + 2` is 3, which is >= 3. So, it returns `ceil((4 + 2) / 3) = 2`.
  - `func_2(1, 4, 2)` returns `1 + 2 = 3`.

- **Example 4**: `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `c = 1`
  - `func_1(1, 1)` calculates the number of tents needed for 1 extrovert and 1 universal. `1 % 3` is 1, and `1 + 1` is 2, which is < 3. So, it returns `None`.
  - `func_2(1, 1, 1)` returns `-1`.

- **Example 5**: `a = 1`, `b = 3`, `c = 2`
  - `func_1(3, 2)` calculates the number of tents needed for 3 extroverts and 2 universals. `3 % 3` is 0, so it returns `ceil((3 + 2) / 3) = 2`.
  - `func_2(1, 3, 2)` returns `1 + 2 = 3`.

- **Example 6**: `a = 19`, `b = 7`, `c = 18`
  - `func_1(7, 18)` calculates the number of tents needed for 7 extroverts and 18 universals. `7 % 3` is 1, and `1 + 18` is 19, which is >= 3. So, it returns `ceil((7 + 18) / 3) = 9`.
  - `func_2(19, 7, 18)` returns `19 + 9 = 28`.

- **Example 7**: `a = 0`, `b = 0`, `c = 0`
  - `func_1(0, 0)` calculates the number of tents needed for 0 extroverts and 0 universals. `0 % 3` is 0, so it returns `ceil((0 + 0) / 3) = 0`.
  - `func_2(0, 0, 0)` returns `0 + 0 = 0`.

- **Example 8**: `a = 7`, `b = 0`, `c = 0`
  - `func_1(0, 0)` calculates the number of tents needed for 0 extroverts and 0 universals. `0 % 3` is 0, so it returns `ceil((0 + 0) / 3) = 0`.
  - `func_2(7, 0, 0)` returns `7 + 0 = 7`.

- **Example 9**: `a = 0`, `b = 24`, `c = 0`
  - `func_1(24, 0)` calculates the number of tents needed for 24 extroverts and 0 universals. `24 % 3` is 0, so it returns `ceil((24 + 0) / 3) = 8`.
  - `func_2(0, 24, 0)` returns `0 + 8 = 8`.

- **Example 10**: `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000`, `c = 1000000000`
  - `func_1(1000000000, 1000000000)` calculates the number of tents needed for 1000000000 extroverts and 1000000000 universals. `1000000000 % 3` is 1, and `1 + 1000000000` is 1000000001, which is >= 3. So, it returns `ceil((1000000000 + 1000000000) / 3) = 666666667`.
  - `func_2(1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000)` returns `1000000000 + 666666667 = 1666666667`.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of tents needed or determine if it's impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.

**Correctness: True**
