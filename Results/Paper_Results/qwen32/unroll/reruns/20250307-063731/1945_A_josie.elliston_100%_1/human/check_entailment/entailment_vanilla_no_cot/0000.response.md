To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to carefully analyze the logic behind the two functions and ensure that they correctly calculate the minimum number of tents required according to the given constraints and preferences of the participants.

### Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`:**
   - This function is supposed to determine the number of tents needed for the extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, it checks if the remaining extroverts and available universals can form a group of 3.
   - If not, it returns `None` (indicating it's impossible to form such groups).
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of tents required by taking the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3.

2. **Function `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`:**
   - This function calculates the total number of tents required by summing the number of tents required for introverts (which is equal to the number of introverts since each introvert needs a tent alone) and the number of tents required for extroverts and universals (calculated by `func_1`).
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns -1 indicating that it's impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.

### Verification:

Let's check the example cases provided in the problem statement using the logic of the program:

1. **First test case (`1 2 3`):**
   - `func_1(2, 3)` returns `ceil((2 + 3) / 3) = 2`, but since 2 extroverts can't form a group of 3 alone, it checks if 2 extroverts + 3 universals can form groups of 3. It can form one group of 3 (2 extroverts + 1 universal) and one more group of 2 universals which will require 1 more tent. So, total tents needed for extroverts and universals is 2. Adding the tent for the introvert, we get `1 + 2 = 3` tents.
   - **Correct**.

2. **Second test case (`1 4 1`):**
   - `func_1(4, 1)` returns `None` because 4 extroverts can't form groups of 3 with 1 universal.
   - **Correct** (returns -1).

3. **Third test case (`1 4 2`):**
   - `func_1(4, 2)` returns `ceil((4 + 2) / 3) = 2`. 4 extroverts can form one group of 3 (2 extroverts + 1 universal) and another group of 2 (2 extroverts + 0 universals). Adding the tent for the introvert, we get `1 + 2 = 3` tents.
   - **Correct**.

4. **Fourth test case (`1 1 1`):**
   - `func_1(1, 1)` returns `None` because 1 extrovert can't form a group of 3 with 1 universal.
   - **Correct** (returns -1).

5. **Fifth test case (`1 3 2`):**
   - `func_1(3, 2)` returns `ceil((3 + 2) / 3) = 2`. 3 extroverts can form one group of 3 and 2 universals can form another group of 2. Adding the tent for the introvert, we get `1 + 2 = 3` tents.
   - **Correct**.

6. **Sixth test case (`19 7 18`):**
   - `func_1(7, 18)` returns `ceil((7 + 18) / 3) = 9`. 7 extroverts can form two groups of 3 (6 extroverts + 0 universals) and one group of 2 (1 extrovert + 1 universal). The remaining 17 universals can form 6 groups of 3 and 1 group of 2. Adding the tents for the introverts, we get `19 + 9 = 28` tents.
   - **Correct**.

7. **Seventh test case (`0 0 0`):**
   - `func_1(0, 0)` returns `0`. No tents are needed.
   - **Correct**.

8. **Eighth test case (`7 0 0`):**
   - `func_1(0, 0)` returns `0`. Adding the tents for the introverts, we get `7 + 0 = 7` tents.
   - **Correct**.

9. **Ninth test case (`0 24 0`):**
   - `func_1(24, 0)` returns `ceil(24 / 3) = 8`.
   - **Correct**.

10. **Tenth test case (`1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`):**
    - `func_1(1000000000, 1000000000)` returns `ceil(2000000000 / 3) = 666666667`. Adding the tents for the introverts, we get `1000000000 + 666666667 = 1666666667` tents.
    - **Correct**.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all the test cases provided in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
