### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - There are three types of participants: introverts, extroverts, and universals.
   - Introverts need a tent each.
   - Extroverts need to be in a tent with exactly two others.
   - Universals can be in a tent with one, two, or three others.
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of tents required to accommodate all participants according to their preferences or determine if it's impossible.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code is structured to handle multiple test cases, each with different counts of introverts, extroverts, and universals.
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for calculating the number of tents required for extroverts and universals. It ensures that if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tent.
   - The function `func_2` calculates the total number of tents by adding the number of tents for introverts (`introverts`) and the result from `func_1` (`ret`).

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it checks if the remaining spots can be filled by universals.
   - If `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it returns `None` indicating that it's impossible to form valid tents with the given extroverts and universals.
   - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of `(extroverts + universals) / 3` which represents the minimum number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.

4. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the participants according to their preferences, so it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the tents for introverts and the result from `func_1`.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For the input `1 2 3`:
     - `introverts = 1`, `extroverts = 2`, `universals = 3`
     - `func_1(2, 3)`:
       - `extroverts % 3 = 2`
       - `extroverts % 3 + universals = 2 + 3 = 5 >= 3`
       - `ceil((2 + 3) / 3) = ceil(5 / 3) = 2`
     - `func_2(1, 2, 3) = 1 + 2 = 3`
     - Output: `3`
   - The code correctly handles this case and others as per the problem description and examples.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents required or if it's impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
