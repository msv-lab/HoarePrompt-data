You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

- Program:
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    (t,) = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        (n, x, y) = R()
        sx = 0
        l = list(R())
        l.sort()
        l.append(n + l[0])
        val = []
        for i in range(1, x + 1):
            c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
            if c == 1:
                sx += 1
            val.append(c)
        val.sort(key=lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x))
        for i in val:
            c = i // 2
            if y < c:
                sx += y * 2
                break
            sx += i
            y -= c
        cons = x + sx - 2
        cons = min(n - 2, cons)
        print(cons)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on these inputs, representing a computed value `cons` that is the minimum of `n - 2` and a derived value from the input list and parameters.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Objective**: Maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake by choosing up to `y` additional vertices from a regular `n`-sided polygon. Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices.

2. **Constraints**:
    - `4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`
    - `2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)`
    - `0 ≤ y ≤ n - x`
    - The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.

3. **Approach**:
    - For each pair of consecutive vertices chosen by Bessie, calculate the number of vertices between them.
    - If there are exactly one vertex between two chosen vertices, it forms a triangle.
    - Sort these gaps and prioritize filling larger gaps first to maximize the number of triangles.
    - Use the additional vertices (`y`) to fill these gaps.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Reading Input**:
    - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by `x` integers representing the vertices chosen by Bessie.

2. **Processing Vertices**:
    - The vertices are sorted.
    - An additional vertex `n + l[0]` is appended to handle the circular nature of the polygon.
    - For each pair of consecutive vertices, the number of vertices between them is calculated and stored in the list `val`.

3. **Sorting Gaps**:
    - The gaps are sorted such that larger gaps are considered first. The sorting key `(1 - x & 1, x)` ensures that even gaps are prioritized over odd gaps of the same size.

4. **Filling Gaps**:
    - The program iterates through the sorted gaps and attempts to fill them using the additional vertices (`y`).
    - For each gap, it calculates the number of triangles that can be formed and updates the total count `sx`.
    - If the number of additional vertices is insufficient to fill a gap, it fills as many as possible and breaks the loop.

5. **Calculating Result**:
    - The total number of triangles is calculated as `x + sx - 2`, but it is constrained to be at most `n - 2`.

### Correctness:

Let's verify if the program correctly implements the above approach:

- **Sorting and Prioritizing Gaps**: The sorting key `(1 - x & 1, x)` ensures that even gaps are prioritized, which is correct because even gaps can be more efficiently filled to form triangles.
- **Filling Gaps**: The program correctly calculates the number of triangles that can be formed with the available vertices and updates the total count.
- **Handling Circular Nature**: By appending `n + l[0]`, the program correctly handles the circular nature of the polygon.
- **Result Calculation**: The result is correctly constrained to be at most `n - 2`, which is the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed in an `n`-sided polygon.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
