The given code snippet defines a lambda function `R` that takes input from the user, splits it into multiple parts, and converts each part into an integer. This function is used to read multiple integers from a single line of input.

The initial state does not include any specific values for `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, or the list of vertices Bessie has chosen. The lambda function `R` does not directly modify any of these variables; it simply provides a way to read and process input.

Since the function `R` is defined but not called in the provided code snippet, no variables are modified, and the input state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `R` is a lambda function that reads and maps input integers.**
