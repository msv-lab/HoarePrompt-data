The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on these inputs, representing a computed value `cons` that is the minimum of `n - 2` and a derived value from the input list and parameters.
