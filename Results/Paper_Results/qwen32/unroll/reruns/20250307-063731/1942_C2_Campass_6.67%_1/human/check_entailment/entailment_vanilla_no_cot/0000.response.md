Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The approach taken in the program does not properly account for the constraints and the goal of maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Sorting and Calculation of Gaps**: The program calculates the gaps between selected vertices and sorts these gaps. However, the sorting criteria and the subsequent calculations do not correctly maximize the number of triangles. The sorting key `(1 - x & 1, x)` is not a standard way to prioritize gaps for maximizing triangles.

2. **Handling of Gaps**: The program attempts to use the gaps to determine how many triangles can be formed, but the logic for reducing gaps and using additional vertices (`y`) is flawed. It does not correctly account for the fact that adding a vertex can reduce multiple gaps and potentially form more triangles.

3. **Final Calculation of Triangles**: The final calculation of the number of triangles (`cons = x + sx - 2`) does not correctly reflect the number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed. The program does not ensure that the triangles are non-intersecting and does not consider the optimal placement of additional vertices.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated algorithm is needed, which involves dynamic programming or a greedy approach that correctly handles the placement of additional vertices to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangles. The current program's approach is oversimplified and does not handle all edge cases and constraints properly.
