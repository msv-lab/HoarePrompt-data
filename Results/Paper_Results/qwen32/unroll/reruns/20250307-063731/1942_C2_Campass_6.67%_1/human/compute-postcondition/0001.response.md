The code snippet provided reads an integer `t` using the lambda function `R()`. This integer `t` represents the number of test cases. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `R` is a lambda function that reads and maps input integers. `t` has been assigned the value read from the input.**
