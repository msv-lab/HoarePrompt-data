Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `T` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `T` is now an integer input by the user. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`) remain unchanged in terms of their descriptions and constraints.
