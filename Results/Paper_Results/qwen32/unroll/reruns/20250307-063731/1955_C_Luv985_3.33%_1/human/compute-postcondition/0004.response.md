Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. If the conditions are met based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the elements in `a`, it returns a specific output; otherwise, it returns a different output.**
