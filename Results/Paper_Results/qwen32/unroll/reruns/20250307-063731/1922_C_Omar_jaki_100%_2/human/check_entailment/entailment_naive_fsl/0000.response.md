Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities based on the problem description. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the closest city logic and the cost calculations.

Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Closest City Calculation**: The program does not explicitly determine the closest city for each city. Instead, it seems to be trying to calculate some cumulative cost based on distances between cities, but it does not correctly map these costs to the closest city transitions.

2. **Cost Calculation Logic**: The cost calculation logic appears to be flawed. The program is attempting to use some form of cumulative cost array (`b`), but it does not correctly reflect the problem's requirements. For instance, it uses `v ** (v > x - w)` and `v ** (v > z - y)`, which do not logically correspond to the problem's cost structure.

3. **Handling Queries**: The program attempts to handle queries by accessing elements in the cost array `b` based on indices derived from the city numbers. However, this logic does not correctly account for the closest city transitions and the associated costs.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases, such as when the cities are very close together or when the cities are at the boundaries of the input constraints.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

**Actual Output (Based on the Program):**
The program will not produce the expected output because it does not correctly implement the logic to find the closest city and calculate the minimum cost based on the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
