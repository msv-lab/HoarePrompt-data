The provided code snippet defines a lambda function `r` that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer. This function is typically used to read multiple integers from a single line of input efficiently.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `x_i`, and `y_i` are described with specific constraints and conditions. However, the code snippet provided does not directly modify any of these variables; it only defines a new function `r` for reading input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^5; for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n and x_i != y_i; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5; `r` is a lambda function that maps input integers from a line of input.**
