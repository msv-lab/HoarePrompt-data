You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

- Program:
def func():
    r = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    (t,) = r()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        r()
        a = (-1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0)
        b = [0, 0]
        for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
            v = y - x
            b += (b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y))
        (u,) = r()
        while u:
            u -= 1
            (c, d) = r()
            if c < d:
                print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
            else:
                print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of city positions and a series of queries. For each query, it calculates and prints the difference in the cumulative distances from the queried cities to their closest neighboring cities, excluding the cities themselves.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem requirements to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities (`n`), their coordinates (`a`), and the number of queries (`m`).
   - For each query, it reads two integers representing the cities between which the travel cost is to be calculated.

2. **Closest City Identification:**
   - The problem specifies that each city has a unique closest city.
   - The closest city to a given city `i` is the city `j` such that the distance `|a_i - a_j|` is the smallest among all other cities.

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The travel cost can be calculated in two ways:
     - Travel directly from city `x` to city `y` with a cost of `|a_x - a_y|`.
     - Travel to the closest city repeatedly until reaching the destination city `y`.
   - The problem asks to find the minimum cost for each query.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads input correctly using the `input()` function and splits it into integers.
   - It handles multiple test cases and queries as specified.

2. **Closest City Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the closest cities for each city by comparing the distances between consecutive cities.
   - It uses a tuple `a` with padding to handle boundary conditions.
   - The list `b` is used to store cumulative costs for traveling to the closest city.

3. **Cost Calculation for Queries:**
   - For each query, the program calculates the cost based on the cumulative costs stored in `b`.
   - It uses the formula `b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]` for `c < d` and `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]` for `c > d`.
   - The formula seems to be used to determine the minimum cost based on the cumulative costs stored in `b`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Closest City Calculation:**
   - The program does not explicitly determine the closest city for each city. Instead, it calculates cumulative costs based on some assumptions about the closest city.
   - The formula `v ** (v > x - w)` and `v ** (v > z - y)` is not a standard way to determine the closest city and seems incorrect.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The cost calculation logic is flawed. The program does not correctly compute the minimum cost for traveling between cities based on the closest city rule.
   - The cumulative costs stored in `b` do not correctly reflect the minimum travel costs as per the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the closest city for each city and calculate the minimum travel cost for each query based on the given rules. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
