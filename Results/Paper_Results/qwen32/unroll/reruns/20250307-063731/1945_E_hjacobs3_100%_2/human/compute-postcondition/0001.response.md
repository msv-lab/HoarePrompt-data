Output State: **array is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, where n is the length of the array, and find is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n; n is the length of the array; l is 0; r is n.**

In this output state, the variables `l` and `r` have been assigned the values 0 and `n`, respectively. The other variables (`array`, `find`, and `n`) remain unchanged as per the initial state.
