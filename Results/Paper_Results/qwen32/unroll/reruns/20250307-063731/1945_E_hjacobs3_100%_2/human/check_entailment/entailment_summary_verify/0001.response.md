Let's systematically evaluate the provided program and its correctness based on the problem description and the function summary.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Input:**
   - A permutation `p` of length `n`.
   - A number `x` to be found.
2. **Goal:**
   - Rearrange the permutation `p` using at most 2 swaps.
   - After rearranging, perform a binary search on the modified permutation.
   - Ensure that after the binary search, `p[l]` is equal to `x`.
3. **Binary Search Steps:**
   - Initialize `l = 0` and `r = n`.
   - Repeat until `r - l = 1`:
     - Calculate `m = floor((r + l) / 2)`.
     - If `p[m] <= x`, set `l = m`.
     - Otherwise, set `r = m`.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Initialization of `l` and `r`:**
   - The binary search in the problem starts with `l = 0` and `r = n`, and the provided code correctly initializes `l = 0` and `r = n`.

2. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The binary search implementation in the provided code is correct.

3. **Finding the Position of `x`:**
   - The code correctly identifies the final `l` after the binary search.

4. **Swapping Logic:**
   - The code checks if the final `l` after the binary search is the index of `x`.
   - If not, it performs one swap to bring `x` to the correct position.
   - However, the code does not handle cases where more than one swap is needed.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Case 1: No Swaps Needed**
  - If `x` is already at the correct position after binary search, the code correctly outputs `0`.
- **Case 2: One Swap Needed**
  - If `x` is not at the correct position after binary search, the code correctly outputs `1` and the indices to swap.
- **Case 3: Two Swaps Needed**
  - The code does not handle cases where two swaps are needed to bring `x` to the correct position.
  - For example, if `x` is at the end of the permutation and needs to be moved to the beginning, it might require two swaps.

### Issues:
- The code only handles cases where no swaps or one swap is needed.
- It does not account for scenarios where two swaps are required to ensure `p[l]` equals `x` after binary search.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not handle all cases correctly, specifically when two swaps are needed. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
