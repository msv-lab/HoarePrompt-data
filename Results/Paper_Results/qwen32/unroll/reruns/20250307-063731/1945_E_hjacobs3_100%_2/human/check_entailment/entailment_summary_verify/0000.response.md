### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the original assessment in detail.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to rearrange a permutation `p` of size `n` by performing at most 2 swaps such that after running a binary search, the element at index `l` (where `l` is the largest index such that `p[l] <= x`) is equal to `x`.

#### Provided Code:
The provided code attempts to find the correct position of `x` using binary search and then performs a swap if necessary. However, the implementation has several issues.

1. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search logic is mostly correct in terms of the loop condition (`r - l > 1`), but the update rules for `l` and `r` need to be carefully examined.
   - The `mid` calculation and the update rules for `l` and `r` should correctly identify the largest index `l` such that `p[l] <= x`.

2. **Handling of Swaps**:
   - The program attempts to perform at most one swap if the initial binary search does not yield the correct position of `x`. However, the problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient, and the program does not ensure that it uses the second swap when necessary.
   - The current implementation only checks if the current `l` is equal to the index of `x` and performs a swap if it is not. This is not sufficient to guarantee that `p_l` will be equal to `x` after binary search.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the permutation is already sorted or nearly sorted in a way that requires more than one swap to place `x` correctly.

#### Function Summary Recap:
The function `func_1` attempts to perform the necessary swaps and returns the swap operations. The summary states that it returns the string representation of `l + 1` and the index of `find` in the array plus 1 if `l` is not equal to the index of `find`.

#### Original Assessment Recap:
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not guarantee that `p_l` will be equal to `x` after performing at most 2 swaps and running the binary search. The provided counterexample demonstrates a scenario where the program fails to correctly place `x` using the binary search and the allowed swaps.

#### Analysis of the Provided Code:
- **Binary Search**: The binary search logic is correct in terms of the loop condition, but the update rules for `l` and `r` need to be checked. Specifically, the `mid` calculation and the update rules for `l` and `r` should correctly identify the largest index `l` such that `p[l] <= x`.
- **Swaps**: The program only attempts to perform one swap if necessary, but the problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient. The program does not ensure that it uses the second swap when necessary.

#### Counterexample Analysis:
The provided counterexample:
```
1
5 3
5 4 3 2 1
```
Expected Output:
```
2
3 5
3 1
```
Explanation:
- The initial binary search will not correctly find the position of `x = 3` because the array is not sorted.
- The program will attempt to swap the first occurrence of `3` with the current `l`, but this will not be sufficient.
- The program does not perform a second swap, which is necessary to correctly place `3` in the position that will be identified by the binary search.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the binary search implementation and the handling of swaps, the program does not guarantee that `p_l` will be equal to `x` after performing at most 2 swaps and running the binary search. The original assessment is correct.

**Final: False**
