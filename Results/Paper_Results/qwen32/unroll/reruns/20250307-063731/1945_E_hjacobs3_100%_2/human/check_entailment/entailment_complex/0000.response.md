### Reasoning:

The given code attempts to solve the problem by using a function `func_1` that tries to determine the swaps needed to make the binary search algorithm find the correct element `x` in the permutation `p`. Here's the breakdown of the logic:

1. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search algorithm is implemented with `l` and `r` initialized to `0` and `n`, respectively.
   - The loop continues until `r - l > 1`.
   - The midpoint `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`.
   - Depending on whether `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, `l` or `r` is updated.

2. **Post-Binary Search Check**:
   - After the binary search loop, it checks if `l` is the index of `find` in the array.
   - If `l` is not equal to the index of `find`, it prints `1` and returns the indices to swap.
   - If `l` is equal to the index of `find`, it prints `0`, indicating no swaps are needed.

### Issues with the Code:
- The binary search implementation is incorrect for the given problem. The binary search requires the array to be sorted, which is not the case here.
- The logic to determine the swaps is flawed. The code only checks if the final `l` is the index of `find` and performs a single swap if not. This is not sufficient to ensure that the binary search will find `x` correctly after at most two swaps.

### Correct Approach:
- **Sort the Array**:
  - We need to ensure that the array can be sorted with at most two swaps.
  - Identify the positions of `x` and the largest element less than or equal to `x`.
  - Perform swaps to ensure that the binary search will correctly find `x`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The binary search logic is not suitable for an unsorted array, and the swap logic is insufficient to guarantee the correct result.

### Correctness:
**False**
