Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `array`, which is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and `find`, an integer such that 1 <= find <= n. The function returns a list containing the string representation of `l + 1` (where `l` is the length of the array) and the string representation of the index of `find` in the array plus 1.**
