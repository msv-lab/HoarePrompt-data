Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, it does not always ensure that after performing at most 2 swaps, the binary search will correctly identify the position of `x` such that `p_l` is equal to `x`.

Here's a detailed analysis of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search logic in the `func_1` function is not correctly implemented. The loop condition and the update rules for `l` and `r` are not in line with the binary search algorithm.
   - The binary search should continue until `r - l` is 1, which is correct, but the `mid` calculation and the update rules for `l` and `r` need to be adjusted to ensure the correct behavior.

2. **Handling of Swaps**:
   - The program attempts to perform at most one swap if the initial binary search does not yield the correct position of `x`. However, the problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient, and the program does not ensure that it uses the second swap when necessary.
   - The program only checks if the current `l` is equal to the index of `x` and performs a swap if it is not. This is not sufficient to guarantee that `p_l` will be equal to `x` after binary search.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where `x` is not present in the permutation, although the problem guarantees that `x` is always in the permutation.
   - The program also does not handle cases where the permutation is already sorted or nearly sorted in a way that requires more than one swap to place `x` correctly.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the failure of the program:

**Counterexample:**

Input:
```
1
5 3
5 4 3 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2
3 5
3 1
```

Explanation:
- The initial binary search will not correctly find the position of `x = 3` because the array is not sorted.
- The program will attempt to swap the first occurrence of `3` with the current `l`, but this will not be sufficient.
- The program does not perform a second swap, which is necessary to correctly place `3` in the position that will be identified by the binary search.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not guarantee that `p_l` will be equal to `x` after performing at most 2 swaps and running the binary search.
