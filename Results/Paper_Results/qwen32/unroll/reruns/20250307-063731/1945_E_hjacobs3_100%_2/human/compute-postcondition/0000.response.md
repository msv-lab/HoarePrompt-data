Output State: **array is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, where n is the length of the array, and find is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n; n is the length of the array.**

Natural Language: The value of `n` has been set to the length of the `array`. The `array` remains a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and `find` still holds an integer value between 1 and `n`, inclusive.
