To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's analyze the provided code. The loop is performing a binary search on the sorted array to find the largest index `l` such that `array[l] <= find`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop:

1. **Initialization**: `l` is set to 0, and `r` is set to `n` (the length of the array).
2. **Condition**: The loop continues as long as `r - l > 1`.
3. **Mid Calculation**: In each iteration, `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`.
4. **Comparison**:
   - If `array[mid] <= find`, it means we can potentially increase `l` to `mid` because all elements from `0` to `mid` are less than or equal to `find`.
   - If `array[mid] > find`, it means we need to decrease `r` to `mid` because all elements from `mid` to `n` are greater than `find`.
5. **Termination**: The loop terminates when `r - l` is no longer greater than 1, meaning `l` and `r` are adjacent indices.

At the end of the loop, `l` will be the largest index such that `array[l] <= find`. `r` will be `l + 1`.

### Example:
Suppose the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `find` is `3`.

- Initially, `l = 0` and `r = 5`.
- First iteration: `mid = (0 + 5) // 2 = 2`. Since `array[2] = 3 <= find`, `l` becomes `2`.
- Second iteration: `mid = (2 + 5) // 2 = 3`. Since `array[3] = 4 > find`, `r` becomes `3`.
- Loop terminates because `r - l = 3 - 2 = 1`.

Thus, after the loop, `l` will be `2` and `r` will be `3`.

### General Case:
In general, after the loop, `l` will be the largest index such that `array[l] <= find`, and `r` will be `l + 1`.

### Output State:
Output State: **l is the largest index such that array[l] <= find, and r is l + 1.**

In natural language: After the loop finishes, `l` will be the index of the largest element in the array that is less than or equal to `find`, and `r` will be the next index after `l`.
