You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    if res:
        print(' '.join(res))
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (0, n)
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    if l != array.index(find):
        print(1)
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
    else:
        print(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an array, which is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and an integer `find` such that 1 <= `find` <= n. It returns a list containing the string representation of `l + 1` (where `l` is the largest index such that `array[l] <= find`) and the string representation of the index of `find` in the array plus 1. If `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in the array, it prints 1; otherwise, it prints 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, it does not always ensure that after performing at most 2 swaps, the binary search will correctly identify the position of `x` such that `p_l` is equal to `x`.

Here's a detailed analysis of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search logic in the `func_1` function is not correctly implemented. The loop condition and the update rules for `l` and `r` are not in line with the binary search algorithm.
   - The binary search should continue until `r - l` is 1, which is correct, but the `mid` calculation and the update rules for `l` and `r` need to be adjusted to ensure the correct behavior.

2. **Handling of Swaps**:
   - The program attempts to perform at most one swap if the initial binary search does not yield the correct position of `x`. However, the problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient, and the program does not ensure that it uses the second swap when necessary.
   - The program only checks if the current `l` is equal to the index of `x` and performs a swap if it is not. This is not sufficient to guarantee that `p_l` will be equal to `x` after binary search.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where `x` is not present in the permutation, although the problem guarantees that `x` is always in the permutation.
   - The program also does not handle cases where the permutation is already sorted or nearly sorted in a way that requires more than one swap to place `x` correctly.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the failure of the program:

**Counterexample:**

Input:
```
1
5 3
5 4 3 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2
3 5
3 1
```

Explanation:
- The initial binary search will not correctly find the position of `x = 3` because the array is not sorted.
- The program will attempt to swap the first occurrence of `3` with the current `l`, but this will not be sufficient.
- The program does not perform a second swap, which is necessary to correctly place `3` in the position that will be identified by the binary search.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not guarantee that `p_l` will be equal to `x` after performing at most 2 swaps and running the binary search.
