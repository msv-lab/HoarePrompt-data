Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `l` is the largest index such that `array[l] <= find`.
- `r` is `l + 1`.
- The current value of `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in the array.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The value to be printed is explicitly given as `1` and does not depend on the variables `l`, `r`, `array`, or `find`.

### Output:
Since the `print` statement directly outputs the integer `1`, the value printed is `1`.

Output: **1**
