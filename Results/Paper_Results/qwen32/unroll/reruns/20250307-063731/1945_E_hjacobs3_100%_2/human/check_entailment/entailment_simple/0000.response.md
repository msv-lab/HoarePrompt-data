### Reasoning:
The given program aims to rearrange a permutation array such that after performing a modified binary search, the element at index `l` is equal to the target element `x`. The binary search is performed on the array after potentially performing up to two swaps.

The provided function `func_1` is designed to identify if a single swap is needed to make `array[l]` equal to `x` after the binary search. The function calculates the index `l` where the binary search would stop and checks if `array[l]` is equal to `x`. If not, it suggests a single swap to bring `x` to the correct position.

However, there are several issues with the provided code:
1. **Indexing**: The code uses Python's 0-based indexing but the problem statement and the expected output are 1-based. This discrepancy needs to be addressed.
2. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search implementation is correct in terms of logic, but the handling of indices is incorrect due to the 0-based indexing issue.
3. **Handling of Two Swaps**: The problem states that up to two swaps are allowed, but the provided code only handles the case where one swap is sufficient. It does not handle the scenario where two swaps are needed.
4. **Output Format**: The function returns a list of strings, but the problem expects the output to be printed in a specific format.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the provided code is not correct as it does not handle all cases and does not ensure that the output is in the correct format. Specifically, it does not handle the case where two swaps are necessary, and it does not correctly manage the 0-based indexing issue.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program based on the problem description and the provided execution states is:

Correctness: **False**
