The function accepts an array, which is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and an integer `find` such that 1 <= `find` <= n. It returns a list containing the string representation of `l + 1` (where `l` is the largest index such that `array[l] <= find`) and the string representation of the index of `find` in the array plus 1. If `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in the array, it prints 1; otherwise, it prints 0.
