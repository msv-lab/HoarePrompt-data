To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the condition `r - l > 1`. Given the initial states:

- `array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n.
- `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n.
- `n` is the length of the array.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is n.

Let's analyze the condition `r - l > 1`:

- `r` is initialized to `n`.
- `l` is initialized to `0`.

The condition `r - l > 1` translates to `n - 0 > 1`, which simplifies to `n > 1`. This means that for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure it is greater than 1.

State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is 0, `r` is n**.
