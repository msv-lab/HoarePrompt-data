Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Indexing**: The problem specifies 1-based indexing for swaps, but the code uses 0-based indexing, which will lead to incorrect swap operations.

2. **Logic for Swapping**: The code only checks if the element at index `l` is equal to `x` after the binary search and performs at most one swap if it is not. However, the problem guarantees that two swaps are sufficient to ensure that the binary search will find `x` at the position `l`. The current logic does not guarantee that the array will be in a state where binary search will correctly identify `x` after at most two swaps.

3. **Output Format**: The function `func_1` is supposed to return a list of strings representing the swaps, but it also prints the number of swaps. This is inconsistent and could lead to incorrect output formatting.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code does not handle cases where the permutation is already sorted or where `x` is already at the correct position after the binary search.

To correct the program, we need to ensure that the array is manipulated correctly to allow binary search to find `x` at the correct position, and we need to ensure that the output format is correct. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    # Find the index of x
    x_index = array.index(find)
    
    # If x is already at the correct position, no swaps needed
    if x_index == 0:
        return [0]
    
    # Swap x to the first position
    swaps = [[x_index + 1, 1]]
    array[0], array[x_index] = array[x_index], array[0]
    
    # Perform binary search to check if x is at the correct position
    l, r = 0, n
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    
    # If x is not at the correct position after one swap, perform a second swap
    if array[l] != find:
        # Find the correct position for x
        correct_pos = array.index(find)
        swaps.append([correct_pos + 1, l + 1])
        array[l], array[correct_pos] = array[correct_pos], array[l]
    
    # Return the number of swaps and the swaps themselves
    return [str(len(swaps))] + [f"{i} {j}" for i, j in swaps]

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    print('\n'.join(res))
```

This corrected version ensures that the array is manipulated correctly to allow binary search to find `x` at the correct position and handles the output format as required.
