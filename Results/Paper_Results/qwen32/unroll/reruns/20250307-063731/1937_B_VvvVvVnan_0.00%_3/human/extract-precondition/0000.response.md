Precondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5) representing the length of the grid. The next two lines contain binary strings of length n, representing the top and bottom rows of the 2 \times n grid, respectively. It is guaranteed that the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.**
