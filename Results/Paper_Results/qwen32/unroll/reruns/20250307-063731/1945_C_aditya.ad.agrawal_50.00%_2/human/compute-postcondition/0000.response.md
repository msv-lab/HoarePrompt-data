The code snippet reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. This does not affect the variables `n` or `a` as they are not mentioned in the code snippet provided. Therefore, the value of `t` is the only variable that has been changed.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s**.
