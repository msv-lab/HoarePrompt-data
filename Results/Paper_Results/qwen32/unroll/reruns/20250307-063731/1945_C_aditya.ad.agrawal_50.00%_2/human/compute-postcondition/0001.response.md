In the provided code snippet, the `while` loop condition is `while t:`. This loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is a non-zero value. Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes at least once, `t` must be a non-zero integer.

Given that `t` is described as "an input integer," we need to ensure that this input integer is non-zero for the loop to execute.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` must be a non-zero integer, `n` is an integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s**
