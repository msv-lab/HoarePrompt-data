Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` composed of 0s and 1s. It calculates and prints the optimal position to split the residents into two groups such that the number of residents preferring the left side is balanced with those preferring the right side around that position.**
