Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
1. **Input:**
   - Multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, given an integer `n` (length of the permutation) and an integer `x` (the number to be found).
   - A permutation `p` of length `n`.

2. **Output:**
   - The number of operations `k` (0 <= k <= 2) to make the binary search algorithm find `x` at position `l` after the algorithm is executed.
   - The indices `i` and `j` for the swap operations if `k > 0`.

3. **Binary Search Algorithm:**
   - Initialize `l` to 0 and `r` to `n - 1`.
   - Loop until `r - l = 1`:
     - Calculate `m = floor((r + l) / 2)`.
     - If `p[m] <= x`, set `l = m`, otherwise set `r = m`.
   - At the end of the loop, `p[l]` should be equal to `x`.

4. **Constraints:**
   - 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4 (number of test cases).
   - 1 <= x <= n <= 2 * 10^5 (length of permutation).
   - The sum of all `n` across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program uses `func_1()` to read integers from input.
   - `func_2()` reads a line of integers and returns them as a list.
   - `func_3()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.
   - It reads the permutation `arr` of size `n`.
   - It finds the position `pos` of `x` in the permutation.
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `n - 1`.
   - It performs a binary search to determine the final position `l` after the algorithm is executed.
   - If `arr[low]` equals `x`, it prints `0` (no operations needed).
   - Otherwise, it prints `1` and the indices to swap `arr[low]` with `arr[pos]` to make `arr[low]` equal to `x`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Handling of `k` Operations:**
   - The program is designed to handle only one swap operation if `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`.
   - However, the problem states that up to two operations are allowed and that it can be shown that two operations are always sufficient.
   - The program does not guarantee that it will always find a solution with two operations if one operation is not sufficient.

2. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The binary search implementation is correct in terms of finding the final position `l`.
   - However, the logic to determine the necessary swaps is not sufficient to handle all cases where two operations are required.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all cases where two operations are required to make `arr[l]` equal to `x` after the binary search. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **False**
