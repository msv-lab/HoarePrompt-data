The code snippet provided only initializes a variable `pos` to `-1`. It does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, or `arr`. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain as they were initially set by `func_1()` and `func_2()`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer returned by `func_1()`, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n` returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is -1**.
