Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`.
- `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`.
- The set `st` contains all midpoints checked during the loop.
- `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The value to be printed is explicitly given as `1` and does not depend on any variables or conditions described in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the integer `1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1**
