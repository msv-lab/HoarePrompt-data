The code assigns the result of `func_2()` to the variable `arr`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the execution of `func_2()`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer returned by `func_1()`, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n` returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`**.
