Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not always produce the correct output for the given problem. Specifically, the program only performs a binary search on the array without properly rearranging the array to ensure that after the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`. The problem requires that you can perform up to 2 swaps to ensure that the binary search will find `x` at the correct position `p_l`.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Assumption**: The program assumes that after one swap, the binary search will always find `x` at the correct position. This is not necessarily true, and the problem guarantees that up to 2 swaps are sufficient.

2. **Handling of `pos`**: The program finds the position of `x` in the array but does not use it effectively to perform the necessary swaps to ensure the binary search will find `x`.

3. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic is correct, but the program does not account for the possibility of needing to perform two swaps to make the binary search successful.

Here is an example where the provided program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
4 5
2 4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
2 2
```

The program incorrectly outputs only one swap, which does not result in the binary search finding `x` at the correct position.

To fix the program, you need to implement logic that ensures the array is rearranged in such a way that the binary search will find `x` at the correct position, potentially using up to two swaps.
