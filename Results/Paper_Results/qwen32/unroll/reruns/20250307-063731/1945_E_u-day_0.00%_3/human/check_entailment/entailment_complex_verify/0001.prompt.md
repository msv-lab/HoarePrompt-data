You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_1`. It is assumed that this function is used to read input values from the standard input and return them as a map of integers.
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains integers, which are the result of splitting the input string by whitespace and converting each split substring to an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a line of input from the standard input, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters, so there are no variables or relationships to describe.
def func_2():
    return list(func_1())
    #The program returns a list that is the result of calling the function `func_1()`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns a list that is the result of calling the function `func_1()`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n.
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer returned by `func_1()`, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n` returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `-1` if `k` is not found.

    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k` and `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`. The set `st` contains all midpoints checked during the loop.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: low + 1, pos + 1 (where low is the largest index such that arr[low] <= k and pos is the index where k would be placed in the sorted array arr)
    #State: `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k` and `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`. The set `st` contains all midpoints checked during the loop. Additionally, if `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, then `arr[low]` is equal to `k`; otherwise, `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines the position of a specified integer `k` within a permutation array `arr` of length `n`. It prints `0` if `k` is found in the array, otherwise it prints `1` followed by the position where `k` would fit in the sorted array and the actual position of `k` if it were to be inserted in the sorted order.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
1. **Input:**
   - Multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, given an integer `n` (length of the permutation) and an integer `x` (the number to be found).
   - A permutation `p` of length `n`.

2. **Output:**
   - The number of operations `k` (0 <= k <= 2) to make the binary search algorithm find `x` at position `l` after the algorithm is executed.
   - The indices `i` and `j` for the swap operations if `k > 0`.

3. **Binary Search Algorithm:**
   - Initialize `l` to 0 and `r` to `n - 1`.
   - Loop until `r - l = 1`:
     - Calculate `m = floor((r + l) / 2)`.
     - If `p[m] <= x`, set `l = m`, otherwise set `r = m`.
   - At the end of the loop, `p[l]` should be equal to `x`.

4. **Constraints:**
   - 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4 (number of test cases).
   - 1 <= x <= n <= 2 * 10^5 (length of permutation).
   - The sum of all `n` across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program uses `func_1()` to read integers from input.
   - `func_2()` reads a line of integers and returns them as a list.
   - `func_3()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.
   - It reads the permutation `arr` of size `n`.
   - It finds the position `pos` of `x` in the permutation.
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `n - 1`.
   - It performs a binary search to determine the final position `l` after the algorithm is executed.
   - If `arr[low]` equals `x`, it prints `0` (no operations needed).
   - Otherwise, it prints `1` and the indices to swap `arr[low]` with `arr[pos]` to make `arr[low]` equal to `x`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Handling of `k` Operations:**
   - The program is designed to handle only one swap operation if `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`.
   - However, the problem states that up to two operations are allowed and that it can be shown that two operations are always sufficient.
   - The program does not guarantee that it will always find a solution with two operations if one operation is not sufficient.

2. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The binary search implementation is correct in terms of finding the final position `l`.
   - However, the logic to determine the necessary swaps is not sufficient to handle all cases where two operations are required.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all cases where two operations are required to make `arr[l]` equal to `x` after the binary search. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct output for all valid inputs.
