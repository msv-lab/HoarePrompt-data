Postcondition: **`low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k` and `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`. The set `st` contains all midpoints checked during the loop. Additionally, if `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, then `arr[low]` is equal to `k`; otherwise, `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.**
