To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's analyze the loop's behavior step by step.

The loop is a binary search variant that continues as long as `low + 1 < high`. In each iteration, it calculates the midpoint `mid` between `low` and `high`, adds `mid` to the set `st`, and then adjusts either `low` or `high` based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` with `k`.

### Key Points:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues until `low` and `high` are consecutive indices.
2. **Midpoint Calculation**: `mid = (low + high) // 2`
3. **Set Update**: `st.add(mid)` - This adds the midpoint to the set `st` in each iteration.
4. **Adjusting `low` and `high`**:
   - If `arr[mid] > k`, then `high` is set to `mid`.
   - Otherwise, `low` is set to `mid`.

### Termination:
The loop terminates when `low` and `high` are consecutive indices, meaning `high` will be `low + 1`.

### Output State:
- **`low`**: The final value of `low` will be the index such that `arr[low]` is the largest value less than or equal to `k` in the range being considered.
- **`high`**: The final value of `high` will be the index such that `arr[high]` is the smallest value greater than `k` in the range being considered.
- **`st`**: The set `st` will contain all the midpoints that were calculated during the execution of the loop.

### Natural Language Explanation:
The loop performs a binary search to find the position where `k` would fit in the sorted array `arr`. When the loop terminates, `low` will point to the largest index where the value is less than or equal to `k`, and `high` will point to the smallest index where the value is greater than `k`. The set `st` will contain all the midpoints that were checked during the search.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k` and `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`. The set `st` contains all midpoints checked during the loop.**
