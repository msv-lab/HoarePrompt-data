To determine the output of the `print(low + 1, pos + 1)` statement, we need to analyze the initial state provided:

1. `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`.
2. `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`.
3. `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.
4. `st` is a set containing all midpoints checked during the loop.
5. `pos` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we need to consider if `pos` has any relation to `low` or `high`.

From the initial state, we can infer that `low` and `high` are indices in the array `arr` that help in finding the position of `k` or the closest elements around `k`. However, `pos` is not defined in the initial state, which means we have to assume `pos` is a variable that holds some index related to the search process, possibly the index where `k` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr`.

Given that `arr[low]` is not equal to `k` and `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `low` points to the largest element in `arr` that is less than `k`. Similarly, `high` points to the smallest element in `arr` that is greater than `k`.

Since `pos` is not defined, let's assume `pos` is the same as `low` for the sake of this problem, as it's a common scenario in binary search algorithms where `pos` can be the insertion point or the index where `k` would be placed.

Let's proceed with this assumption:
- `low + 1` will be the 1-based index of the largest element in `arr` that is less than `k`.
- `pos + 1` will be the 1-based index where `k` would be placed in the sorted array `arr` if it were to be inserted.

Given the information, the output will be:
Output: **low + 1, pos + 1 (where low is the largest index such that arr[low] <= k and pos is the index where k would be placed in the sorted array arr)**

Since the exact values of `low` and `pos` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated indices.
Output: **low + 1, pos + 1 (where low is the largest index such that arr[low] <= k and pos is the index where k would be placed in the sorted array arr)**
