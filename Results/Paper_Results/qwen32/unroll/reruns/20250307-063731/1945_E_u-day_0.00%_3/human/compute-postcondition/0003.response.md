The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `k`, `arr`, and `pos` are not part of the loop head and do not affect whether the loop will execute.

Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer returned by `func_1()`, which means it should be at least 1 to ensure the loop executes. The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be set before the loop starts because it is initialized by the `range` function. Therefore, the only requirement is that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer returned by `func_1()` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n` returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is -1**
