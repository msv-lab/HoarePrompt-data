Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

# Annotated Functions:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_3()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_1`. It is assumed that this function is used to read input values from the standard input and return them as a map of integers.
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains integers, which are the result of splitting the input string by whitespace and converting each split substring to an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a line of input from the standard input, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters, so there are no variables or relationships to describe.
def func_2():
    return list(func_1())
    #The program returns a list that is the result of calling the function `func_1()`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns a list that is the result of calling the function `func_1()`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n.
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer returned by `func_1()`, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n` returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `-1` if `k` is not found.
    low, high = 0, n - 1
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k` and `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`. The set `st` contains all midpoints checked during the loop.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: low + 1, pos + 1 (where low is the largest index such that arr[low] <= k and pos is the index where k would be placed in the sorted array arr)
    #State: `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k` and `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`. The set `st` contains all midpoints checked during the loop. Additionally, if `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, then `arr[low]` is equal to `k`; otherwise, `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines the position of a specified integer `k` within a permutation array `arr` of length `n`. It prints `0` if `k` is found in the array, otherwise it prints `1` followed by the position where `k` would fit in the sorted array and the actual position of `k` if it were to be inserted in the sorted order.
