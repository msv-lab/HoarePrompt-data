The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `0`. The initial state provides information about the variables `low`, `high`, `st`, and `arr`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value printed is independent of these variables.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print(0)`.
2. The value `0` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.
3. The initial state describes the context of the variables `low`, `high`, `st`, and `arr`, but none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement.
4. Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
