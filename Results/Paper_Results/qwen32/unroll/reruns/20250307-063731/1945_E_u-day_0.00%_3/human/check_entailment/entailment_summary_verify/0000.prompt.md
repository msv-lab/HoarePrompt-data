You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        st.add(mid)
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
    if arr[low] == k:
        print(0)

        print(low + 1, pos + 1)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function determines the position of a specified integer `k` within a permutation array `arr` of length `n`. It prints `0` if `k` is found in the array, otherwise it prints `1` followed by the position where `k` would fit in the sorted array and the actual position of `k` if it were to be inserted in the sorted order.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always correctly ensure that after performing at most 2 swaps, the binary search will find the target element `x` at position `l` when the loop terminates. Here are some specific issues and a counterexample:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Swaps**: The program only performs one swap if the element at position `l` is not equal to `x`. However, the problem description states that up to two swaps can be performed if necessary.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in the program is correct in terms of the binary search algorithm itself, but the program does not guarantee that after performing the swaps, the element `x` will be at position `l` when the loop terminates.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where the array requires two swaps to position `x` correctly.

### Counterexample:

Consider the following test case:
```
1
6 3
4 5 6 1 2 3
```

- The initial array is `[4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3]`, and the target `x` is `3`.
- The program will find `pos` as `5` (0-indexed), which is the position of `3` in the array.
- The binary search will proceed as follows:
  - `low = 0`, `high = 5`
  - `mid = 2`, `arr[mid] = 6`, so `high` becomes `2`
  - `mid = 1`, `arr[mid] = 5`, so `high` becomes `1`
  - Now `low = 0`, `high = 1`, and `arr[low] = 4`, which is not equal to `3`.
- The program will perform one swap between `low + 1` (which is `1`) and `pos + 1` (which is `6`), resulting in the array `[4, 3, 6, 1, 2, 5]`.
- After this swap, the binary search will proceed as follows:
  - `low = 0`, `high = 5`
  - `mid = 2`, `arr[mid] = 6`, so `high` becomes `2`
  - `mid = 1`, `arr[mid] = 3`, so `low` becomes `1`
  - Now `low = 1`, `high = 2`, and `arr[low] = 3`, which is equal to `3`.
- However, the program only outputs one swap, and the binary search algorithm is not guaranteed to find `x` at position `l` after just one swap in all cases.

To fix this, the program needs to handle cases where two swaps are necessary to position `x` correctly. The current implementation does not account for such scenarios, making it incorrect.
