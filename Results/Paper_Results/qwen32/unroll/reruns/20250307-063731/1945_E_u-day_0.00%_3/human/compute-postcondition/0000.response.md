The code snippet `n, k = func_1()` indicates that the values of `n` and `k` will be updated to whatever values are returned by the function `func_1()`. Since the initial state only specifies that `n` is a positive integer and `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, we do not have specific values for `n` and `k` before the function call. After the function call, `n` and `k` will hold the values returned by `func_1()`, and we cannot determine these values without knowing the implementation of `func_1()`.

However, we can state that after the function call, `n` will still be a positive integer and `k` will be an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, as these constraints are part of the problem's precondition.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer returned by `func_1()`, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n` returned by `func_1()`**.
