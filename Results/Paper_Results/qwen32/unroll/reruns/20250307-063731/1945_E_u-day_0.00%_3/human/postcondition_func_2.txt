The function determines the position of a specified integer `k` within a permutation array `arr` of length `n`. It prints `0` if `k` is found in the array, otherwise it prints `1` followed by the position where `k` would fit in the sorted array and the actual position of `k` if it were to be inserted in the sorted order.
