The provided code snippet initializes a new set `st`. This action does not affect any of the previously defined variables (`n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`). Therefore, the output state will include the initialization of `st` as an empty set, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer returned by `func_1()`, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n` returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `-1` if `k` is not found, `low` is `0`, `high` is `n - 1`, `st` is an empty set.**
