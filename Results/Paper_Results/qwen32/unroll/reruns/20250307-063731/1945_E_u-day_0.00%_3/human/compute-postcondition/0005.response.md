The code snippet assigns the value `0` to `low` and the value `n - 1` to `high`. The values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, and `pos` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer returned by `func_1()`, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n` returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `-1` if `k` is not found, `low` is `0`, `high` is `n - 1`.**
