To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to ensure that the condition `low + 1 < high` is satisfied. Let's analyze the variables involved in the loop head:

- `low` is initialized to `0`.
- `high` is initialized to `n - 1`.

The condition `low + 1 < high` translates to `0 + 1 < high`, which simplifies to `1 < high`. Therefore, `high` must be greater than `1` for the loop to execute.

Given that `high` is `n - 1`, we need `n - 1 > 1`, which simplifies to `n > 2`. This means `n` must be a positive integer greater than `2`.

No other variables in the loop head (`low` and `high` are the only ones) need to be adjusted, and the other variables (`k`, `arr`, `pos`, and `st`) are not part of the loop condition.

So, the adjusted state for the first iteration of the loop to proceed is:

State: **`n` must be a positive integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `-1` if `k` is not found, `low` is `0`, `high` is `n - 1`, `st` is an empty set**.
