To determine the output state, we need to analyze the loop's behavior:

1. The loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`.
2. For each iteration, it checks if the element at the current index `i` in the array `arr` is equal to `k`.
3. If it finds a match (`arr[i] == k`), it sets `pos` to the current index `i`.
4. The loop continues to the next iteration regardless of whether a match was found or not.
5. After the loop finishes, `pos` will hold the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or it will remain `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`.

Given this, the output state will be:

- `n` remains unchanged as it is the length of the array `arr`.
- `k` remains unchanged as it is the value we are searching for in `arr`.
- `arr` remains unchanged as we are not modifying it within the loop.
- `pos` will be the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or `-1` if `k` is not found.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer returned by `func_1()`, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n` returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `-1` if `k` is not found.**
