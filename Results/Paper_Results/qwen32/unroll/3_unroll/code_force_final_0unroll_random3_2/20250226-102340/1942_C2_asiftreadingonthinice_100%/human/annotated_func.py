#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and y is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Additionally, the second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

    #State: a series of `tt` lines, each containing the result of the calculations for each test case, formatted as described above.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each involving a set of parameters including the number of vertices `n`, the number of chosen vertices `x`, and a value `y`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the distribution of the chosen vertices and the value `y`, ensuring the result does not exceed `n - 2`.
