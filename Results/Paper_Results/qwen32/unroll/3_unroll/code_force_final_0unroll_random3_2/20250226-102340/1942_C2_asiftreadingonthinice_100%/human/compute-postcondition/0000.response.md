The code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `tt`. This integer represents the number of test cases, `t`, as per the initial state description. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of vertices Bessie has chosen remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`tt` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ `n` - `x`. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Additionally, the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**
