t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case in test_cases is a tuple consisting of three integers (n, x, y) where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. Additionally, each test case includes a list of x distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, with each integer in the range from 1 to n. The sum of x across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
