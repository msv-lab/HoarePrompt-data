The only variable in the loop head is `ii`, which is the loop variable for the `for` loop. The loop will execute `tt` times, so `ii` will take values from 0 to `tt-1`. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of vertices) do not affect whether the loop can execute; they are used within the loop body, which is omitted here.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `tt` is at least 1. Given that the initial state specifies `1 ≤ tt ≤ 10^4`, the loop will definitely execute with the provided constraints on `tt`. Therefore, we only need to ensure that `ii` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`tt` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ `n` - `x`. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Additionally, the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. `ii` is 0**
