Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each involving a set of parameters including the number of vertices `n`, the number of chosen vertices `x`, and a value `y`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the distribution of the chosen vertices and the value `y`, ensuring the result does not exceed `n - 2`.**
