Reasoning:  
1. The program starts by reading an integer `x` which represents the number of test cases.
2. It then enters a loop that iterates `x` times, corresponding to the number of test cases.
3. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input.
4. The program then compares `x` and `y`:
   - If `x` is less than `y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`.
5. This ensures that for each test case, the minimum of the two numbers is printed first, followed by the maximum.

The program correctly implements the logic to find and print the minimum and maximum of two numbers for each test case as described in the problem statement. The example input-output pair provided in the problem description matches the expected behavior of the given program.

Correctness: **True**
