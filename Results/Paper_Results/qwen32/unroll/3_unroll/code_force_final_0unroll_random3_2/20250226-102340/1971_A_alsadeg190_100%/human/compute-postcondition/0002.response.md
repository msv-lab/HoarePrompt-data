The provided loop iterates `x` times, and in each iteration, it reads two integers from the input, reassigns these integers to `x` and `y`, and then prints the smaller of the two followed by the larger one. However, the values of `x` and `y` at the start of each iteration are overwritten by the input values, meaning the initial values of `x` and `y` provided in the initial state do not affect the subsequent iterations after the first one. The loop itself does not modify `t`, and `y` is only used within the loop for comparison and printing.

Given that the loop modifies `x` and `y` with each iteration based on the input, the final state of `x` and `y` after the loop will be the values from the last iteration's input. `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, x and y are the integers from the last iteration's input.**
