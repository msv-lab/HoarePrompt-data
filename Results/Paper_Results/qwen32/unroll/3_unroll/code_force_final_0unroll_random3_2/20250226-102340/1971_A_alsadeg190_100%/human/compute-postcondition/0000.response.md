The provided code snippet updates the value of `x` by reading an integer input from the user. The other variables `t` and `y` remain unchanged. Since the input value for `x` is not specified, we can only describe the state in terms of the input operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9.**
