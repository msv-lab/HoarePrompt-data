You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a rectangle's dimensions and the coordinates of two distinct points within it. For each test case, it determines the outcome of a game played on this setup and prints either 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' based on the positions and rules defined in the code.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze its logic against the problem statement and the provided examples.

### Reasoning:

The program's logic is based on several conditions to determine the outcome of the game between Alice and Bob. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Immediate Draw Condition**:
   - If Alice's initial row (clues[2]) is greater than Bob's initial row (clues[4]), or if the board has only one row (clues[0] == 1), the game is a draw. This is because Alice cannot move down if she's already in the last row, and if the board has only one row, neither player can move.

2. **Parity of Rows**:
   - The program checks if both Alice's and Bob's initial rows are either even or odd. If they are, the game's outcome depends on their column positions:
     - If their column positions are the same, Bob wins.
     - If their column positions differ by more than 1, the game is a draw if Alice or Bob can reach the other's position within the possible moves.
     - If their column positions differ by exactly 1, the game is a draw if Alice or Bob can reach the other's position within the possible moves.

3. **Different Parity of Rows**:
   - If Alice's and Bob's initial rows have different parities, the game's outcome also depends on their column positions:
     - If their column positions are the same, Alice wins.
     - If their column positions differ by more than 1, the game is a draw if Alice or Bob can reach the other's position within the possible moves.
     - If their column positions differ by exactly 1, the game is a draw if Alice or Bob can reach the other's position within the possible moves.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Column Differences**:
   - The logic for handling column differences is overly complex and incorrect. The conditions for determining a win or draw are not correctly implemented. For example, the conditions involving `abs(clues[3] - clues[5])` and `(clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2` are not correctly reflecting the game's mechanics.

2. **Lack of Consideration for Multiple Moves**:
   - The logic does not correctly account for the sequence of moves and the optimal play by both players. For example, it does not consider the case where Alice or Bob can force a win by moving optimally in multiple turns.

3. **Incorrect Assumptions**:
   - The program assumes that the game can be decided solely based on the initial positions and the parity of the rows. However, the game's outcome can depend on the sequence of moves and the strategic play by both players.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified in the program's logic, it is clear that the program does not correctly determine the outcome of the game based on the problem's rules. The logic is overly simplistic and does not account for the complexity of the game.
