The provided code snippet initializes a dictionary `suits` with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and sets all their values to `None`. This operation does not affect the variables `answers`, `func_1`, `t`, `n`, `trump`, or `trumps`, which remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`answers` is an empty list; The function `func_1` takes no input arguments; `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases; `n` is an integer representing the number of rounds played; `trump` is a single character representing the trump suit; `trumps` is an empty list; `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values `None`.**
