The only variable in the loop head is `trumps`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `trumps`. If `trumps` is not an empty list, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `trumps` is an empty list, so we need to adjust it to be a non-empty list.

State: **`answers` is ['9H 10H', '7C 8C', 'KD J', 'AS Q'], `trumps` is not an empty list, `suits` is {'H': None, 'C': None, 'D': 'K', 'S': 'A'}**
