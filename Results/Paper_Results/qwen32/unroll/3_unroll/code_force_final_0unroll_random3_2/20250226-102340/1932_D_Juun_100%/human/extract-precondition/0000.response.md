Precondition: **The function `func_1` takes no input arguments. The input for the function is provided through standard input (stdin) and consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 16) representing the number of rounds played. The second line contains a single character representing the trump suit, which is one of "CDHS". The third line contains `2n` space-separated two-character strings, each describing a card in the discard pile. Each card is represented by its rank (one of "23456789") followed by its suit (one of "CDHS"). All cards are different within each test case.**
