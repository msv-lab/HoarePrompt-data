    #State: `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters; `mapping` is a dictionary with unique mappings from characters in `encoded` to unique characters from 'a' to 'z'; `decoded` is a list of characters corresponding to the mapped values of `encoded`.
    return ''.join(decoded)
    #The program returns a string formed by joining the characters in the list `decoded`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a string of lowercase Latin letters as input and returns a new string where each unique character in the input is replaced by a unique character from 'a' to 'z', preserving the order of their first appearance.
