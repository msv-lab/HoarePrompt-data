### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its function summary in the context of the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
1. **Construct `r`:** From the encoded string `b`, extract all distinct characters and sort them alphabetically.
2. **Symmetric Mapping:** Each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric counterpart in `r` (first to last, second to second last, etc.).
3. **Decoding:** Replace each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding symmetric character from `r`.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program does not follow the steps described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Construction of `r`:** The program does not construct `r` as described. Instead, it attempts to map each character in the encoded string to a unique character from 'a' to 'z', which is incorrect.
2. **Symmetric Mapping:** The program does not create a symmetric mapping based on `r`. The mapping process is flawed since it assigns the first unused character in the alphabet to each new character in the encoded string, which does not adhere to the symmetric relationship.
3. **Decoding Process:** The decoding process is incorrect because it does not use the symmetric mapping based on `r`.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary provided states that the function takes a string of lowercase Latin letters as input and returns a new string where each unique character in the input is replaced by a unique character from 'a' to 'z', preserving the order of their first appearance. This summary does not align with the problem's requirement of symmetric mapping based on `r`.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly decode the string:
1. Extract all distinct characters from the encoded string and sort them to form the string `r`.
2. Create a mapping where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric counterpart.
3. Use this mapping to decode the encoded string.

#### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified and the mismatch between the function summary and the problem requirements, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False** (The program is incorrect as per the problem description and original assessment.)
