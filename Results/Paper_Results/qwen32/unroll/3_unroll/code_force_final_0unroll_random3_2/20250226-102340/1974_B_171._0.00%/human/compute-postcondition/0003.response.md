To determine the output state after the loop has executed, let's analyze the code provided:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `encoded`: A string of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `mapping`: An initially empty dictionary.
   - `decoded`: An initially empty list.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each character `char` in the string `encoded`:
     - If `char` is already in the `mapping` dictionary, append the corresponding value (which is a character) to the `decoded` list.
     - If `char` is not in the `mapping` dictionary, find the first character `c` (from 'a' to 'z') that is not already a value in the `mapping` dictionary. Add an entry `mapping[chr(c)] = char` to the dictionary and append `chr(c)` to the `decoded` list.

3. **Effect of the Loop:**
   - The loop essentially creates a unique mapping from each character in the `encoded` string to a character from 'a' to 'z' that hasn't been used yet.
   - The `decoded` list is populated with these mapped characters in the order they appear in `encoded`.

4. **Final State:**
   - `encoded`: Remains unchanged.
   - `mapping`: Contains a unique mapping from each character in `encoded` to a unique character from 'a' to 'z'.
   - `decoded`: A list of characters, each corresponding to a character in `encoded` through the `mapping`.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters; `mapping` is a dictionary with unique mappings from characters in `encoded` to unique characters from 'a' to 'z'; `decoded` is a list of characters corresponding to the mapped values of `encoded`.**
