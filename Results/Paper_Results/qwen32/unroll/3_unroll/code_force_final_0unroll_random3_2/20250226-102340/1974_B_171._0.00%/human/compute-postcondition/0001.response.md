The code snippet initializes a new list named `decoded` and does not affect the values of `encoded` or `mapping`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the `decoded` list, which is initially empty.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters; `mapping` is an empty dictionary; `decoded` is an empty list.**
