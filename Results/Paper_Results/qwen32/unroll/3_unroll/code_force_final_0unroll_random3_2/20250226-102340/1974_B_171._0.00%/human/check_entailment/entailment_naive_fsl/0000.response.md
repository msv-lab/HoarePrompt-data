Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`. The main issue lies in the way the mapping is constructed and used.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Mapping Construction**:
   - The code attempts to build a mapping from the encoded string to the original string by assigning the first unused character to each new character encountered in the encoded string. This is incorrect because it does not respect the symmetry property described in the problem statement.
   - The correct approach is to first determine the string `r` (which consists of all distinct characters from the original string `s` in alphabetical order) and then construct the mapping based on the symmetric property of `r`.

2. **Example of Failure**:
   - Consider the encoded string `b = "serofedsoc"`. According to the problem statement, the original string `s` should be `codeforces`.
   - The provided code will not produce `codeforces` because it does not correctly map the characters based on the symmetric property of `r`.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Determine `r`**:
   - Extract all distinct characters from the encoded string `b` and sort them alphabetically to form `r`.

2. **Construct Symmetric Mapping**:
   - Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character in `r`.

3. **Decode the String**:
   - Use the mapping to decode each character in `b` to the corresponding character in the original string `s`.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
import sys
from typing import List

input = sys.stdin.readline
if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_cases = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(input().strip())
        encoded = input().strip()
        decoded = decode(encoded)
        print(decoded)

def decode(encoded: str) -> str:
    # Step 1: Determine the string r
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    
    # Step 2: Create the symmetric mapping
    mapping = {}
    r_length = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(r_length):
        mapping[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[r_length - 1 - i]
        mapping[unique_chars[r_length - 1 - i]] = unique_chars[i]
    
    # Step 3: Decode the string
    decoded = []
    for char in encoded:
        decoded.append(mapping[char])
    
    return ''.join(decoded)
```

This corrected code correctly handles the decoding process as described in the problem statement.
