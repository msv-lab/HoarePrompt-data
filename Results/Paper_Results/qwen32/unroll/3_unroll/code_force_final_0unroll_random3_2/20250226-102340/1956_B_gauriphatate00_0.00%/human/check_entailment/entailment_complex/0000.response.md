### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of points that you can score given the optimal play of Nene, who always plays to maximize her score and minimize yours.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
- `func_1` calculates the number of pairs of cards in your hand. Each pair contributes to a potential point for you or Nene if the other player has the matching card.
- The function calculates this by counting the number of integers that appear exactly twice in the list `a` (i.e., `pairs`).
- The function then returns the minimum of `pairs` and `n // 2`. This is because:
  - `pairs` represents the maximum number of points you could theoretically score if all the pairs you have are matched with Nene's cards.
  - `n // 2` represents the maximum number of turns you have, and thus the maximum number of points you could score if every turn results in a point.

#### Analysis of `func_2`:
- `func_2` is responsible for handling multiple test cases.
- It reads input from standard input, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and collects the results.
- Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

#### Correctness:
- The logic in `func_1` is correct. Given the constraints and the problem description, the minimum of `pairs` and `n // 2` correctly represents the maximum number of points you can score, assuming optimal play from both you and Nene.
- `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and outputs the results.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
