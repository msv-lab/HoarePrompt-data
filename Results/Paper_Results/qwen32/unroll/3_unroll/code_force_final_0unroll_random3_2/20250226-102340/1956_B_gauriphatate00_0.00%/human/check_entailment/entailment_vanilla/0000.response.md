### Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally, given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Pairs of Cards:** Since each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the deck, each player will receive exactly one card of each integer they have in their hand.
2. **Scoring:** You score a point if you place a card on the table and there is already a card with the same integer on the table. Otherwise, you score no points.
3. **Optimal Play:** Nene will play to maximize her score and minimize your score. This means she will try to avoid giving you points whenever possible.

#### Strategy:
- **Pairs in Your Hand:** If you have a pair of cards (two cards with the same integer), you can score a point if Nene places one of the cards first. However, Nene will try to avoid this by playing her pairs first.
- **Max Points:** The maximum number of points you can score is the number of pairs you have, but Nene will counter this by playing her pairs first. Therefore, the maximum number of points you can get is the minimum of the number of pairs you have and half the total number of cards you have (since you and Nene each have n cards and each turn results in one card being placed on the table).

#### Implementation:
- **Counter:** We use a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in your hand.
- **Pairs:** We count the number of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand.
- **Result:** The result for each test case is the minimum of the number of pairs you have and `n // 2`.

The provided program correctly implements this logic:
- **Function `func_1`:** This function calculates the maximum number of points you can get by counting the pairs in your hand and returning the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`.
- **Function `func_2`:** This function reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally, given that Nene plays optimally.

Correctness: **True**
