Let's carefully analyze the given program, the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated code to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Description Recap

- Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move.
- Determine if it's possible to have a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- Output "Yes" if possible, otherwise "No".

### Program Code Recap

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Annotations Recap

The annotations describe the state of the program before and after the function call:
- `t` is the number of test cases.
- `n` and `m` are integers read from input.
- The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is checked, and based on this, "Yes" or "No" is printed.

### Original Assessment Recap

The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect because:
- It doesn't handle the case where `m > n` correctly.
- The logic should ensure that the difference `n - m` is even when `m <= n` and handle `m > n` separately.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Condition Analysis**:
    - **Case 1: `m > n`**
        - If `m > n`, it is impossible to have more cubes than moves because each move can only add or remove one cube.
        - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` will evaluate to `False` because `n - m` will be negative, which is correct.
        - The program will output "No", which is correct for `m > n`.

    - **Case 2: `m <= n`**
        - If `m <= n`, the difference `n - m` should be even because each move either adds or removes one cube.
        - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference is even.
        - The condition `n - m >= 0` ensures that the difference is non-negative, which is true by the assumption `m <= n`.
        - The program will output "Yes" if the difference is even, and "No" if the difference is odd, which is correct.

2. **Edge Cases**:
    - **Test Case 1:** `n = 3`, `m = 3`
        - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0` is `True`, so output is "Yes".
        - This is correct.
    - **Test Case 2:** `n = 2`, `m = 4`
        - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0` is `False`, so output is "No".
        - This is correct.
    - **Test Case 3:** `n = 5`, `m = 3`
        - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0` is `True`, so output is "Yes".
        - This is correct.
    - **Test Case 4:** `n = 1`, `m = 2`
        - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0` is `False` (because `n - m` is negative), so output is "No".
        - This is correct.

### Conclusion

The original assessment incorrectly claims that the program does not handle the case when `m > n` correctly. However, the program's condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` naturally handles `m > n` by evaluating to `False` due to the negative difference.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**
