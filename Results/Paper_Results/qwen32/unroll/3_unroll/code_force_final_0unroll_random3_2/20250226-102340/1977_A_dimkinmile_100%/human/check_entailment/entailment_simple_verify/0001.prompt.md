You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and m such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if ((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0) :
        print('Yes')
        #This is printed: Yes
    else :
        print('No')
        #This is printed: No
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, with `n` and `m` being the values from the most recent line of input. The difference between `n` and `m` is either even and non-negative, or not divisible by 2, or less than 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program based on the problem description.

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move. After `n` moves, we need to determine if it is possible to have a tower with `m` cubes.

The logic in the provided code checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0`. This logic is incorrect because it doesn't fully capture all the possible scenarios. Specifically, it doesn't account for the possibility that `m` can be greater than `n` or that `n` and `m` can be such that the difference can be achieved by a combination of additions and subtractions.

Let's consider the following scenarios:

1. **When `m > n`:** It's impossible to have more cubes than moves because each move can only add or remove one cube. Therefore, the condition should handle this case.
2. **When `m <= n`:** The difference `n - m` should be even because each move either adds or removes one cube, so the net effect of an even number of moves can be zero (if we add and remove the same number of times), or a net addition/removal of an even number of cubes.

The correct condition should be:
- If `m > n`, print "No" because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves.
- If `m <= n` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`, print "Yes" because we can achieve the desired number of cubes.
- If `m <= n` and `(n - m) % 2 != 0`, print "No" because we cannot achieve an odd difference with an even number of moves.

Let's test the given code with some edge cases:

1. **Test Case 1:** `n = 3`, `m = 3`
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0` is `True`, so output is "Yes".
   - This is correct.

2. **Test Case 2:** `n = 2`, `m = 4`
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0` is `False`, so output is "No".
   - This is correct.

3. **Test Case 3:** `n = 5`, `m = 3`
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0` is `True`, so output is "Yes".
   - This is correct.

4. **Test Case 4:** `n = 4`, `m = 1`
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0` is `True`, so output is "Yes".
   - This is correct.

5. **Test Case 5:** `n = 4`, `m = 2`
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0` is `True`, so output is "Yes".
   - This is correct.

6. **Test Case 6:** `n = 5`, `m = 2`
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0` is `True`, so output is "Yes".
   - This is correct.

7. **Test Case 7:** `n = 5`, `m = 0`
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0` is `True`, so output is "Yes".
   - This is correct.

However, the code does not handle the case when `m > n` correctly. For example, if `n = 1` and `m = 2`, the output should be "No", but the current code will output "No" because `n - m` is negative, which is not the correct logic.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The code does not correctly handle the case when `m > n`. The condition should be adjusted to correctly determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves by ensuring the difference is even when `m <= n` and handling the case when `m > n` separately.
