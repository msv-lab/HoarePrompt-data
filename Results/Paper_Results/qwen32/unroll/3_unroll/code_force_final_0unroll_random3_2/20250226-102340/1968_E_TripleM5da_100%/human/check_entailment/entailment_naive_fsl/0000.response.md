Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\). Specifically, the program only outputs points in a very limited pattern and does not explore other possible configurations that could yield more distinct Manhattan distances.

For example, consider the case when \(n = 3\):
- The program outputs:
  ```
  1 1
  1 2
  3 3
  ```
- The set of Manhattan distances for these points is:
  - Between (1,1) and (1,2): \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
  - Between (1,1) and (3,3): \(|1-3| + |1-3| = 4\)
  - Between (1,2) and (3,3): \(|1-3| + |2-3| = 3\)
- Thus, \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 3, 4\}\) (including the distance 0 from a point to itself).

However, the optimal solution for \(n = 3\) (as shown in the example) is:
- Points: (2,1), (2,3), (3,1)
- The set of Manhattan distances is:
  - Between (2,1) and (2,3): \(|2-2| + |1-3| = 2\)
  - Between (2,1) and (3,1): \(|2-3| + |1-1| = 1\)
  - Between (2,3) and (3,1): \(|2-3| + |3-1| = 3\)
- Thus, \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).

The program does not achieve the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 3\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
