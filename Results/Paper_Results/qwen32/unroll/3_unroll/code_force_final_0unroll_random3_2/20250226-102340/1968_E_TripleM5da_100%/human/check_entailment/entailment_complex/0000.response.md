Reasoning:  
The provided program does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all test cases. The program always outputs the points (1,1), (1,2), and then (i,i) for each i from 3 to n. This strategy does not necessarily yield the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of n.

For example, consider the case where n = 3. The program outputs the points (1,1), (1,2), and (3,3). The set of distinct Manhattan distances in this case is \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 3\}\), which has a size of 3.

However, there is a better configuration for n = 3, as shown in the example output: (2,1), (2,3), and (3,1). The set of distinct Manhattan distances in this case is \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 4, which is larger.

The program needs to be modified to find a configuration of points that maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances for each value of n. The provided program does not achieve this for all values of n.

Correctness: **False**
