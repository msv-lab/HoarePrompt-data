Reasoning:  
The given program does not correctly solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. Here's why:

1. **Initial Outputs**: The program starts by outputting `1 1` and `1 2` for every test case. This is fine for the first two points.
2. **Subsequent Outputs**: For each integer `i` from 3 to `n`, it outputs `i i`. This places points on the diagonal starting from (3,3) to (n,n).

While this approach does create some distinct Manhattan distances, it does not maximize the number of distinct distances. The goal is to strategically place points to achieve the maximum number of unique Manhattan distances.

For example:
- For `n = 3`, the program outputs:
  ```
  1 1
  1 2
  3 3
  ```
  The distinct Manhattan distances are: 0, 1, 2. However, as shown in the problem statement, a better arrangement could be:
  ```
  2 1
  2 3
  3 1
  ```
  Which gives distinct Manhattan distances: 0, 1, 2, 3.

- For `n = 4`, the program outputs:
  ```
  1 1
  1 2
  3 3
  4 4
  ```
  The distinct Manhattan distances are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. However, a better arrangement could be:
  ```
  1 1
  1 3
  4 3
  4 4
  ```
  Which gives distinct Manhattan distances: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

The program does not consider other possible placements of points that could yield more distinct Manhattan distances. Therefore, the program is not correct for maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

Correctness: **False**
