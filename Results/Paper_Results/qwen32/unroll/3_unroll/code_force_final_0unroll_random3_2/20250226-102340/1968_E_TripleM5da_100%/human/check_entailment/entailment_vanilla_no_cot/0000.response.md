Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of \(n\). The program always starts with the points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\), and then adds points of the form \((i, i)\) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\).

This strategy does not guarantee that the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances is achieved for all \(n\). For example, consider \(n = 3\):

- The program outputs the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((3, 3)\).
- The Manhattan distances are:
  - Between \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\): \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
  - Between \((1, 1)\) and \((3, 3)\): \(|1-3| + |1-3| = 4\)
  - Between \((1, 2)\) and \((3, 3)\): \(|1-3| + |2-3| = 3\)
- The set of distinct Manhattan distances is \(\{1, 3, 4\}\), which has a size of 3.

However, the optimal arrangement for \(n = 3\) is \((2, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((3, 1)\), which gives the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), with a size of 4.

Therefore, the given program does not always produce the correct output for maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).
