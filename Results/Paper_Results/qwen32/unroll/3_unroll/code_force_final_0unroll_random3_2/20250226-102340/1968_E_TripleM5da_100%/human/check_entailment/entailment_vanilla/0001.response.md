Let's analyze the given program and see if it correctly solves the problem.

The program is supposed to output a set of n points on an n x n grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of points is maximized.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
3. It then prints the point (1, 1).
4. It prints the point (1, 2).
5. For the remaining points (from 3 to n), it prints points of the form (i, i).

Let's analyze the output for different values of `n`:

- For `n=2`, the output is:
  ```
  1 1
  1 2
  ```
  The Manhattan distances are:
  - Between (1,1) and (1,2): |1-1| + |1-2| = 1
  - Between (1,1) and (1,1): 0
  - Between (1,2) and (1,2): 0
  The distinct Manhattan distances are {0, 1}, which is correct for `n=2`.

- For `n=3`, the output is:
  ```
  1 1
  1 2
  3 3
  ```
  The Manhattan distances are:
  - Between (1,1) and (1,2): 1
  - Between (1,1) and (3,3): |1-3| + |1-3| = 4
  - Between (1,2) and (3,3): |1-3| + |2-3| = 3
  - Between (1,1) and (1,1): 0
  - Between (1,2) and (1,2): 0
  - Between (3,3) and (3,3): 0
  The distinct Manhattan distances are {0, 1, 3, 4}, which is not optimal. For `n=3`, the optimal solution should give us the distinct distances {0, 1, 2, 3}.

- For `n=4`, the output is:
  ```
  1 1
  1 2
  3 3
  4 4
  ```
  The Manhattan distances are:
  - Between (1,1) and (1,2): 1
  - Between (1,1) and (3,3): 4
  - Between (1,1) and (4,4): 6
  - Between (1,2) and (3,3): 3
  - Between (1,2) and (4,4): 5
  - Between (3,3) and (4,4): 2
  - Between (1,1) and (1,1): 0
  - Between (1,2) and (1,2): 0
  - Between (3,3) and (3,3): 0
  - Between (4,4) and (4,4): 0
  The distinct Manhattan distances are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, which is correct for `n=4`.

However, for `n=3`, the program does not produce the optimal solution.

Given the above analysis, the program does not always produce the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of `n`.

**Conclusion:**
Correctness: **False**
