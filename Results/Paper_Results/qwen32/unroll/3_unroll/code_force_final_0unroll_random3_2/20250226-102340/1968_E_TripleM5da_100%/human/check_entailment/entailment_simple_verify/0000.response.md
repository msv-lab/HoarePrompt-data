### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\). Let's analyze the program and the annotated code to understand why.

#### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and for each test case, it reads an integer \(n\). It then prints the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and for each \(i\) from 3 to \(n\), it prints the point \((i, i)\). This means the points are:
- \((1, 1)\)
- \((1, 2)\)
- \((3, 3)\)
- \((4, 4)\)
- ...
- \((n, n)\)

#### Manhattan Distance Calculation:
Let's calculate the Manhattan distances for the points generated by the program for \(n = 3\):
- Between \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\): \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
- Between \((1, 1)\) and \((3, 3)\): \(|1-3| + |1-3| = 4\)
- Between \((1, 2)\) and \((3, 3)\): \(|1-3| + |2-3| = 3\)

Thus, \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 3, 4\}\).

#### Comparison with Optimal Solution:
The optimal solution for \(n = 3\) is:
- Points: \((2, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), \((3, 1)\)
- The set of Manhattan distances is:
  - Between \((2, 1)\) and \((2, 3)\): \(|2-2| + |1-3| = 2\)
  - Between \((2, 1)\) and \((3, 1)\): \(|2-3| + |1-1| = 1\)
  - Between \((2, 3)\) and \((3, 1)\): \(|2-3| + |3-1| = 3\)
- Thus, \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).

The optimal solution achieves a larger set \(\mathcal{H}\) compared to the program's solution.

#### General Case:
For larger \(n\), the program's approach of placing points on the line \(y = x\) starting from \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) does not explore other configurations that could yield more distinct Manhattan distances. The optimal strategy involves placing points in a way that maximizes the variety of distances, which is not achieved by the program's pattern.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\). Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

### Final: **False**
