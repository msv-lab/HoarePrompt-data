Output State: **After all iterations, `t` test cases have been processed, and for each test case, either 'Bob' or 'Alice' has been printed based on whether `1` was present in the list `l`. The values of `n`, `l`, `e`, and `m` will reflect the state of the last test case processed. Variables `t` and the list of test cases remain unchanged.**
