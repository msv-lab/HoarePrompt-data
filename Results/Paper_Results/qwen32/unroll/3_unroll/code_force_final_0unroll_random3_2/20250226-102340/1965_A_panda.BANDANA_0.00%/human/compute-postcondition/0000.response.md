Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Natural language: The variable `t` is now assigned the value of the input integer, which is between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. The conditions for `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged as they are described in the initial state.
