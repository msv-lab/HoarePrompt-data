In the provided task, the for loop will execute based on the value of `testcases`, which is determined by the return value of `func_3()`. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and `testcases`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, we do not need to adjust its state. The only variable that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `testcases`.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, `testcases` must be greater than 0. If `testcases` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.

State: **`testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()` and must be greater than 0**
