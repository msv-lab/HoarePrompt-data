Output State: **`A` is the list returned by `func_4()`, `n` is the length of the list returned by `func_4()`, `m` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers returned by `func_4()`, `F` is the list returned by `func_4()`, `max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` that is part of the pair with the largest difference, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is `max_diff`.**

In this output state, the variable `ans` has been assigned the value of `max_diff`, while all other variables retain their initial values as described.
