To determine the output state after the loop executes all its iterations, we need to understand the effects of the loop on the variables involved. 

Given:
- The initial state is `testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()`.
- The loop iterates `testcases` number of times.
- In each iteration, `func_6()` is called.

From the provided information, we can infer:
- The loop will execute `func_6()` exactly `testcases` times.
- The value of `testcases` remains unchanged throughout the loop as it is used only for controlling the number of iterations.
- No other variables are mentioned as being modified inside the loop, so we assume no other variables are affected.

Therefore, the output state will be the same as the initial state with the exception that `func_6()` has been called `testcases` number of times. Since the problem asks for the state of variables and not the side effects of function calls, we only consider the variables mentioned.

Output State: **`testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()`.**
