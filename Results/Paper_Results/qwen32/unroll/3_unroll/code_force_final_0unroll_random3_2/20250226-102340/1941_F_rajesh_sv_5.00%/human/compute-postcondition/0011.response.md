To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. **A**: This is a list returned by `func_4()`.
2. **n**: This is the length of the list `A`.
3. **m and k**: These are values returned by `func_4()`. However, their specific roles in the context of the problem are not explicitly mentioned.
4. **D**: This is a sorted list of unique integers returned by `func_4()`.
5. **F**: This is another list returned by `func_4()`.
6. **max_diff**: This is the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`.
7. **next_max_diff**: This is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`.
8. **index**: This is the index of the element in `A` that is part of the pair with the largest difference.
9. **left**: This is the element at `A[index - 1]`.
10. **right**: This is the element at `A[index]`.
11. **ans**: This is the smallest possible maximum difference found during the loop's execution.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(max(ans, next_max_diff))
```

This statement will print the maximum value between `ans` and `next_max_diff`.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `ans` is the smallest possible maximum difference found during the loop's execution.
- `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`.

Since `ans` is the smallest possible maximum difference, it is not necessarily the same as `next_max_diff`. However, the `print` statement will output the larger of the two values.

Therefore, the output will be the larger value between `ans` and `next_max_diff`.

Output: **max(ans, next_max_diff) (where ans is the smallest possible maximum difference found during the loop's execution and next_max_diff is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in A)**
