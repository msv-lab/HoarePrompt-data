Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` and performs calculations to derive three characters. These characters are then printed in sorted order. The characters are determined based on the value of `lex`, with values up to 26 corresponding to letters 'a' to 'z', and values above 26 being adjusted accordingly.**
