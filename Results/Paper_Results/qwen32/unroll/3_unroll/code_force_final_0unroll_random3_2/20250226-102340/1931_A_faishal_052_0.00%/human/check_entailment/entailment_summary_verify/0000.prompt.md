You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex <= 26:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            else:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` and performs calculations to derive three characters. These characters are then printed in sorted order. The characters are determined based on the value of `lex`, with values up to 26 corresponding to letters 'a' to 'z', and values above 26 being adjusted accordingly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all possible cases for the given problem description. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The code attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest word by first filling the first two positions with either 1 or 26 based on the value of `lex`. This approach does not guarantee the smallest possible word.
   - The final letter is then set to the remaining value of `lex`. This may not result in a valid word if the remaining value is greater than 26, or if the constructed word is not lexicographically minimal.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not correctly handle cases where the sum of the positions of the letters is exactly 78 (the maximum possible sum for three letters, "zzz").
   - For example, if `lex` is 78, the code will incorrectly assign 26 to the first two positions and 26 to the third position, resulting in "zzz". However, the correct output should be "zzz" as well, but the code might not handle this correctly due to the logic used.

3. **Example of Incorrect Output**:
   - Consider the input `n = 78`. The correct output should be "zzz". However, the provided code may not handle this correctly because it might assign values in a way that does not ensure the smallest lexicographical order.
   - Another example is `n = 52`. The correct output should be "aay", but the code might output something else due to the incorrect logic.

4. **Improvement**:
   - A correct approach would involve starting with the smallest possible values for the first two letters and then calculating the third letter. This ensures that the word is lexicographically minimal.
   - For example, starting with "aaa" (sum = 3), we incrementally increase the letters to reach the desired sum while maintaining the smallest lexicographical order.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        n = int(input())
        # Start with the smallest possible word "aaa"
        a, b, c = 1, 1, n - 2
        # Adjust b and c to ensure they are within the range [1, 26]
        if c > 26:
            b += c - 26
            c = 26
        if b > 26:
            a += b - 26
            b = 26
        # Print the result
        print(chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96))

# Example usage
# func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the word is constructed in the lexicographically smallest order for any valid input within the specified range.
