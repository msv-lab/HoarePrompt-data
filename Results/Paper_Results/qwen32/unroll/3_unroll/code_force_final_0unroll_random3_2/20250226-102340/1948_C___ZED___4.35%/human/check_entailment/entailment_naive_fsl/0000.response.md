Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all the cases as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code and find a counterexample where the program fails.

#### Issues in the code:
1. **Handling of the last column**: The code checks if the second last character in the second row (`b[-2]`) is `>`. If not, it prints "NO". This is incorrect because the robot needs to reach the last column (`n`), and the direction of the arrow in the second last column does not directly determine if the robot can reach the last column.
2. **Loop logic for even-indexed columns in the second row**: The code checks if all even-indexed columns in the second row have `>`. If not, it sets `no_path` to `False`. This is also incorrect because the robot can move up and down, and the presence of `<` in even-indexed columns does not necessarily mean the robot cannot reach the target.
3. **Loop logic for odd-indexed columns in the first row**: The code checks if all odd-indexed columns in the first row have `>`. This is incorrect for the same reason as above.

#### Counterexample:
Let's consider the following input:
```
1
4
><><
><><
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of the expected output:**
The robot can follow the path: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4).

**Actual Output of the given program:**
```
NO
```

This is because the program incorrectly checks the direction of the arrows in specific positions and fails to consider the possibility of moving up and down between the rows.

#### Conclusion:
Since the program does not correctly handle all cases, it is incorrect. The provided counterexample demonstrates a scenario where the robot can reach the target cell, but the program incorrectly outputs "NO". Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
