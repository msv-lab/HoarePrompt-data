Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to create a string of uppercase Latin letters.
- The string must contain exactly `n` special characters.
- A special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
- For each test case, if it's possible to create such a string, we print "YES" followed by the string. If it's not possible, we print "NO".

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**:
    - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Logic for Constructing the String**:
    - If `n` is 1, the program prints "NO". This is because it's impossible to have exactly one special character in a string of uppercase Latin letters. A single character cannot be special since it has no neighbors.
    - If `n` is greater than 1, the program constructs a string:
        - If `n` is even, it creates pairs of repeating characters (e.g., "AA", "BB", "CC", ...). Each pair contributes two special characters (one at the start and one at the end of the pair), so `n // 2` pairs will create exactly `n` special characters.
        - If `n` is odd, it starts with "AAA" (which has 2 special characters) and then creates pairs of repeating characters similar to the even case, but with one less pair. This ensures that the total number of special characters is `n`.

3. **Output**:
    - The program prints "YES" followed by the constructed string if it's possible to create such a string.
    - It prints "NO" if `n` is 1.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with the example provided:

**Input:**
```
3
6
1
2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
AAABAACC
NO
YES
MM
```

**Program's Output:**
- For `n = 6`, the program will output a string with 6 special characters. The string "AAABAACC" is one valid example.
- For `n = 1`, the program correctly outputs "NO".
- For `n = 2`, the program will output a string with 2 special characters. The string "MM" is one valid example.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all given conditions and produces the expected output for the provided example. It also correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1.

**Correctness: True**
