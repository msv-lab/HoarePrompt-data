The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n`. For each test case, it prints 'NO' if `n` is 1, and otherwise prints 'YES' followed by a string of length `n` composed of alternating uppercase letters. The string contains duplicate letters if `n` is even, and the first three characters are 'AAA' if `n` is odd, followed by alternating duplicate letters.
