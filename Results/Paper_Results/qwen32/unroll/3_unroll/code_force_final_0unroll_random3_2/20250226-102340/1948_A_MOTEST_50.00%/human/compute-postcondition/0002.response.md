`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `s` remains `'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`, and the precondition for `t` (1 <= t <= 50) is still valid. The value of `n` for each test case is not affected by this input, so it remains as an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50 for each of the t test cases.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50; `s` is `'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`; for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50.**
