You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50.
def func():
    os.system('cls')
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                ans, x = 'AAA', 1
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)
        
    #State: `t` is unchanged; `s` is `'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`; `n`, `ans`, and `x` hold the values from the last test case processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n`. For each test case, it prints 'NO' if `n` is 1, and otherwise prints 'YES' followed by a string of length `n` composed of alternating uppercase letters. The string contains duplicate letters if `n` is even, and the first three characters are 'AAA' if `n` is odd, followed by alternating duplicate letters.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's examine the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to construct a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly `n` special characters in the string.
- A character is considered special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
- We need to handle multiple test cases.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the number of special characters required in the string.

2. **Logic for Constructing the String:**
   - If `n` is 1, the program outputs "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly one special character in a string of uppercase Latin letters.
   - If `n` is even, the program constructs a string by repeating pairs of consecutive letters from the alphabet. For example, for `n=6`, it constructs "AABBCC".
   - If `n` is odd, the program starts with "AAA" and then repeats pairs of consecutive letters from the alphabet. For example, for `n=3`, it constructs "AAABB".

3. **Output:**
   - The program correctly outputs "YES" followed by the constructed string if a valid string can be formed.
   - It outputs "NO" if `n` is 1.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Case 1: `n=1`**
  - The program correctly outputs "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly one special character in a string.
- **Case 2: `n` is even**
  - The program constructs a string with exactly `n` special characters by repeating pairs of letters. For example, for `n=6`, the string "AAABAACC" has 6 special characters.
- **Case 3: `n` is odd**
  - The program constructs a string with exactly `n` special characters by starting with "AAA" and then repeating pairs of letters. For example, for `n=3`, the string "AAABB" has 3 special characters.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all described cases and constructs valid strings for the given problem constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
