You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

def func():
    os.system('cls')
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                (ans, x) = ('AAA', 1)
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
import os
import string

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50.
def func():
    os.system('cls')
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                ans, x = 'AAA', 1
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)
        
    #State: `t` is unchanged; `s` is `'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`; `n`, `ans`, and `x` hold the values from the last test case processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n`. For each test case, it prints 'NO' if `n` is 1, and otherwise prints 'YES' followed by a string of length `n` composed of alternating uppercase letters. The string contains duplicate letters if `n` is even, and the first three characters are 'AAA' if `n` is odd, followed by alternating duplicate letters.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case when `n == 1`. According to the problem description, if there is no suitable string, the program should print "NO". However, the code incorrectly prints "YES" and an empty string for `n == 1`. Additionally, the code does not generate a string with exactly `n` special characters for all valid `n` values; it only handles the case when `n` is greater than 1. For `n == 1`, the correct response should be "NO" because it is impossible to have a single character that is special (as it would require a neighbor).

Let's consider the following test case:
```
Input:
2
1
2

Expected Output:
NO
YES
MM

Actual Output:
NO
YES

```
The actual output is missing the second line for the second test case, which should be "MM". This indicates that the code is not fully correct for all potential cases.
