Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. The solution uses a recursive function `func_2` to determine the winner, but it does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the Nim game variant described.

The key to solving this problem is to recognize that it is a variant of the Nim game where the Grundy number (or Nim-sum) concept from combinatorial game theory can be applied. Specifically, the game can be analyzed using the XOR operation on the sizes of the piles. If the XOR of all pile sizes is zero, the position is losing for the player to move (Alice in this case). Otherwise, it is winning.

Here is a correct implementation of the solution:

```python
def determine_winner(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for n, piles in test_cases:
        xor_sum = 0
        for pile in piles:
            xor_sum ^= pile
        if xor_sum == 0:
            results.append("Bob")
        else:
            results.append("Alice")
    return results

# Reading input
t = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    piles = list(map(int, input().split()))
    test_cases.append((n, piles))

# Determine results
results = determine_winner(t, test_cases)

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This solution calculates the XOR of all pile sizes for each test case and determines the winner based on whether the result is zero or not.
