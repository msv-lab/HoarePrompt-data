Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= len(a), `n` is not equal to 1 and `n` is not equal to 2, and `winNext` is the result of `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`. Additionally, either `winNext` is not equal to 2, or `winNext` is equal to 1 and the first element of `a` is 1.**
