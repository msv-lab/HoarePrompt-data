The code snippet calls the function `func_2` with the arguments `a[1:]` and `n - 1`. This means the first element of the list `a` is removed, and `n` is decremented by 1. The result of this function call is assigned to the variable `winNext`.

The precondition states that `a` is a list of integers, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `n` is neither 1 nor 2. After the function call, `a` still holds its original list of integers, but the function `func_2` operates on a modified version of `a` (i.e., `a[1:]`). The value of `n` is also modified to `n - 1` for the function call, but the original `n` remains unchanged in the current scope.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= len(a), `n` is not equal to 1 and `n` is not equal to 2, and `winNext` is the result of `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`.**
