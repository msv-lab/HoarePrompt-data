### Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem by first transforming the array `a` such that each element at index `i` becomes `a[i] + i + 1`. It then constructs a set of these transformed elements, removes duplicates, sorts them in decreasing order, and then reconstructs the final array `b` by filling in the gaps between the unique elements with the appropriate values to maximize the lexicographical order.

Let's break down the program step-by-step to verify its correctness:

1. **Transformation and Deduplication**:
   - The program reads the array `a` and transforms each element `a[i]` to `a[i] + i + 1`.
   - It then converts the list to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in descending order. This step ensures that we only consider unique values in the final set `S`.

2. **Reconstruction of `b`**:
   - The program uses a `Counter` to keep track of the frequency of each transformed element.
   - It iterates through the sorted unique elements and for each element, it inserts the necessary number of intermediate values between the current element and the previous one. The number of intermediate values is determined by the difference between the current and previous elements minus one, the remaining count of elements to be inserted (`cnt`), and the current count of remaining duplicates (`cur`).
   - The program then appends the current element to the result list `ans` and updates the counts accordingly.
   - After processing all unique elements, any remaining elements to be inserted are appended to `ans` by decrementing the last element in `ans`.

3. **Output**:
   - The final list `ans` is printed, which represents the lexicographically largest array `b` that can be constructed.

### Verification against Example:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **First Test Case**:
  - Input: `2 1`
  - Transformed: `[3, 2]`
  - Unique Sorted: `[3, 2]`
  - Output: `[3, 2]` (which is correct as per the example)

- **Second Test Case**:
  - Input: `1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000`
  - Transformed: `[2, 1002, 1003, 1000004, 1000000005]`
  - Unique Sorted: `[1000000005, 1000004, 1003, 1002, 2]`
  - Output: `[1000000005, 1000004, 1003, 1002, 2]` (which is correct as per the example)

- **Third Test Case**:
  - Input: `6 4 8`
  - Transformed: `[7, 5, 11]`
  - Unique Sorted: `[11, 7, 5]`
  - Output: `[11, 7, 6]` (which is correct as per the example)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the required logic to produce the lexicographically largest array `b` for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
