Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of unique integers derived from the original list where each integer at index `i` was the original integer at that index plus `i + 1`, sorted in descending order; `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the original list `a` minus 1; `cur` is the sum of the remaining counts in `counter` after decrementing each by 1; `cnt` is `n - len(a)` reduced by the number of elements inserted into `ans` between the elements of `a`; `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` in their original order, plus any additional elements inserted between them.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(cnt):
    ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
