The code snippet initializes a variable `cur` to 0. This does not affect the list `a` or the Counter object `counter`. Therefore, the values of `a` and `counter` remain unchanged. The only change is the introduction of the variable `cur` with the value 0.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer at index `i` is the original integer at that index plus `i + 1`; `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in `a`; `cur` is 0.**
