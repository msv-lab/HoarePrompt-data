The code `a = list(set(a))` converts the list `a` into a set to remove any duplicate elements and then converts it back into a list. This operation changes the list `a` but does not affect the `counter` or `cur` variables directly. The `counter` object still holds the frequency of elements as they were before the conversion, but it is no longer synchronized with the list `a` because duplicates have been removed.

Output State: **`a` is a list of unique integers derived from the original list where each integer at index `i` was the original integer at that index plus `i + 1`; `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the original list `a`; `cur` is 0.**
