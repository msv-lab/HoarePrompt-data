The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `ans`. None of the other variables (`a`, `counter`, `cur`, `cnt`) are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`a` is a list of unique integers derived from the original list where each integer at index `i` was the original integer at that index plus `i + 1`, sorted in descending order; `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the original list `a`; `cur` is 0; `cnt` is `n - len(a)`; `ans` is an empty list.**
