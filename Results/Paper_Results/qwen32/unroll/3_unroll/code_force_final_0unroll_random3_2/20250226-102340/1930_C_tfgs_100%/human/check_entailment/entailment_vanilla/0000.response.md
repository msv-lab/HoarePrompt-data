Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input and Output:**
   - Input: Multiple test cases. Each test case has an array `a` of length `n`.
   - Output: For each test case, output the lexicographically largest array `b` formed by the described operations.

2. **Operations:**
   - Perform `n` operations where in each operation, select an index `i`, insert `a[i] + i` into a set `S` (a set does not allow duplicates), and remove `a[i]` from `a`.
   - After all operations, `b` is the sorted version of `S` in decreasing order.

3. **Objective:**
   - To maximize the lexicographical order of `b`.

### Solution Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.

2. **Modifying Array `a`:**
   - For each element in `a`, it adds the index (1-based) to the element. This is done by `a[i] += i + 1`.

3. **Using Set and Counter:**
   - The program converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates.
   - It then sorts the unique elements in decreasing order.
   - A `Counter` is used to keep track of the occurrences of each element before removing duplicates.

4. **Constructing `b`:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted unique elements.
   - For each element, it adds the element to `ans` and decreases its count in the `Counter`.
   - It also calculates how many elements can be inserted between the current and previous element to maximize the lexicographical order.
   - If there are remaining elements to be added (due to duplicates), it adds the smallest possible values to `ans`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where all elements are the same.
   - It ensures that the final array `b` is the lexicographically largest possible.

### Correctness:
The solution correctly implements the described operations and ensures that the final array `b` is the lexicographically largest possible. It uses a set to handle duplicates and a counter to keep track of occurrences, ensuring that the final array is constructed correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct based on the problem description and handles the given constraints effectively.

Correctness: **True**
