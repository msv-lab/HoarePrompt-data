The code snippet sorts the list `a` in descending order. The `counter` object and `cur` variable remain unchanged as they are not affected by the sorting operation.

Output State: **`a` is a list of unique integers derived from the original list where each integer at index `i` was the original integer at that index plus `i + 1`, sorted in descending order; `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the original list `a`; `cur` is 0.**

In simpler terms: The list `a` is now sorted in descending order, while `counter` and `cur` retain their original values.
