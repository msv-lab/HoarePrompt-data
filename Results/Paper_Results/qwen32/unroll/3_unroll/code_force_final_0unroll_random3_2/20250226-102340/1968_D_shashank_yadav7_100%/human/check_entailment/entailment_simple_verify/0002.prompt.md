You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
   - It adjusts `P_B` and `P_S` to be zero-indexed by subtracting 1 from them.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `sp` and `bp` are initialized to the values of `a` at the starting positions of Sasha and Bodya, respectively.
   - `sm` and `bm` are initialized to the scores that Sasha and Bodya would have if they stayed at their starting positions for all `k` turns.

3. **Simulation of the Game:**
   - The program simulates the game for up to `k` turns.
   - In each turn, it updates the positions of Sasha and Bodya based on the permutation `p`.
   - It calculates the potential maximum score for each player if they stayed at their current position for the remaining turns.
   - It updates the total scores `sp` and `bp` by adding the value of `a` at their current positions.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - After the simulation, the program compares the final scores `bm` and `sm`.
   - It prints "Bodya" if `bm` is greater, "Sasha" if `sm` is greater, and "Draw" if they are equal.

### Issues and Corrections:

1. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs `n` times, but it should run `k` times since the game lasts for `k` turns.
   - The condition `if k == 0: break` is unnecessary because the loop already runs for `n` iterations. Instead, the loop should run for `k` iterations.

2. **Score Calculation:**
   - The current implementation incorrectly calculates the potential maximum scores (`bm` and `sm`) by multiplying the remaining turns `k` with the current position value `a[b]` and `a[s]`. This is incorrect because the players can choose to stay at their positions or move, and the maximum score should consider all possible moves.
   - A more accurate approach would be to keep track of the maximum score for each player considering all possible paths they can take, but this would require a more complex algorithm (e.g., dynamic programming or cycle detection in the permutation).

3. **Optimization:**
   - The problem constraints allow `k` to be up to \(10^9\), which means simulating each turn individually is not feasible.
   - The program should detect cycles in the permutation to avoid simulating the same positions multiple times.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly simulate the game for all possible moves and does not handle large values of `k` efficiently. Therefore, it is incorrect for the given problem description.
