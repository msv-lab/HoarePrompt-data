Let's analyze the given problem and the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to maximize the sum of an array `a` of length `n` by performing a specific operation no more than 5·10^5 times. The operation involves selecting a subarray from `a` and setting all its elements to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded value) of the subarray. The goal is to find the maximum possible sum of the array and a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.

### Key Points

1. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.
2. **Operation**: We can choose any subarray `[a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r]`, calculate its MEX, and set all elements in the subarray to this MEX.
3. **Objective**: Maximize the sum of the array `a` and provide the sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
4. **Constraints**: The length of the array `n` is at most 18, and the number of operations is at most 5·10^5.

### Program Analysis

The program consists of three main functions:

1. **`func_1`**: This function calculates the maximum possible sum of the array if we consider subarrays starting from `start_index` to `end_index`. It uses memoization to store results of subproblems in `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations.
2. **`func_2`**: This function returns the sequence of operations required to achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`.
3. **`make_stairs`**: This function constructs a "staircase" pattern in the array, where each element in the subarray is set to its index value, which helps in maximizing the sum.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Global Variables**: The program uses global variables `arr`, `res_dict`, `start_index`, and `res` without declaring them as global in the functions where they are modified. This can lead to undefined behavior.
2. **Logic for `make_stairs`**: The `make_stairs` function is not correctly implemented to ensure that the array is transformed into a staircase pattern. It does not correctly handle the transformation and might not achieve the maximum sum.
3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases, especially when the array is already optimal or when the MEX calculation results in unexpected values.
4. **Output Format**: The program does not correctly format the output as specified in the problem statement. It does not return the number of operations `m` and the sequence of operations in the required format.

### Correctness

Given the issues mentioned above, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct output for all valid inputs. The logic for transforming the array and calculating the maximum sum is flawed, and the output format is incorrect.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
