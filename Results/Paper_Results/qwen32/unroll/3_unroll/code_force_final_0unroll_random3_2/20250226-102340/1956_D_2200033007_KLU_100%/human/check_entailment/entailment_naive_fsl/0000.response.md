Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
Upon reviewing the provided program, there are several issues that indicate it may not correctly solve the problem as described:

1. **Incomplete Function Definitions**: The function `make_stairs` relies on a variable `start_index` which is not defined within the function or passed as a parameter. This will lead to a `NameError` when `make_stairs` is called.

2. **Global Variables**: The program uses global variables `arr`, `res_dict`, and `res` without defining them within the functions. This can lead to undefined behavior and is generally bad practice.

3. **Logic Errors**: The logic to compute the MEX and perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array is incomplete and not clearly defined. The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the maximum possible sum for a given subarray, but the logic to achieve this is not well-explained or correctly implemented. The function `func_2` is supposed to return the sequence of operations, but it relies on the results from `func_1` which might not be correctly computed.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases such as arrays with all elements being the same, arrays with all elements being zero, or arrays with a single element. While the examples provided might work, it is not clear that the program will work for all possible inputs within the given constraints.

5. **Output Format**: The program does not output the required format. It should output the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the sequence of operations. The current implementation does not produce this output.

6. **Recursive Calls**: The recursive calls in `func_1` and `func_2` can lead to excessive recursion depth for larger arrays, which is not handled by the program.

Given these issues, the program is not guaranteed to work correctly for all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
