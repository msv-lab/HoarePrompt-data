The code snippet modifies the value at the `start_index` of the array `arr` to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer, `is_already_stairs` is `False`, `res` contains the tuple `(start_index, start_index)`, and `arr[start_index]` is 1.**
