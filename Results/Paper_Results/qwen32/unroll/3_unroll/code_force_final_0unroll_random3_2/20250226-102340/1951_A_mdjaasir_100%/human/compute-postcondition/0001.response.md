To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state before the for loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `t`.

Given the for loop:
```python
for i in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will execute if and only if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, so there is no need to adjust its state before the loop starts.

The state of `start` and `end` does not affect the execution of the loop based on the given loop statement, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` must be greater than 0**
