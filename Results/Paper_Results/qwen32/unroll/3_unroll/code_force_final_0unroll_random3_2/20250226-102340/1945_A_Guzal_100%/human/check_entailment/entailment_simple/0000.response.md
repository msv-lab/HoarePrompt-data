### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate introverts, extroverts, and universals according to their preferences, or determine if it's impossible.

- **Introverts (a)**: Each introvert must be in a tent alone.
- **Extroverts (b)**: Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two others.
- **Universals (c)**: Universals can be in a tent alone, with one other person, or with two others.

**Logic of the Program:**

1. **Check for impossible cases:**
   - If the number of extroverts `b` is not divisible by 3, we need to check if the remaining people (extroverts + universals) can fill up the last tent. If the remainder of `b` divided by 3 plus the number of universals `c` is less than 3, it's impossible to form a tent with the remaining extroverts and universals, so the program correctly outputs `-1`.

2. **Calculate the number of tents:**
   - Each introvert will need a tent alone, so we start with `k = a` tents.
   - We then try to accommodate the extroverts and universals in groups of 3. The number of full groups of 3 that can be formed from `b + c` people is `(b + c) // 3`. We add this to `k`.
   - If there are any remaining people after forming these groups (i.e., `(b + c) % 3 != 0`), we need an additional tent for these remaining people.

3. **Output the result:**
   - For each test case, the program prints either `-1` if it's impossible to accommodate everyone, or the calculated number of tents `k`.

**Verification:**

Let's verify the logic with a few examples:

- **Example 1:** `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `c = 3`
  - `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c = 2 + 3 = 5 >= 3`, so it's possible.
  - `k = 1 + (2 + 3) // 3 = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - `(b + c) % 3 = 2`, so we need one more tent: `k = 2 + 1 = 3`
  - Output: `3`

- **Example 2:** `a = 1`, `b = 4`, `c = 1`
  - `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c = 1 + 1 = 2 < 3`, so it's impossible.
  - Output: `-1`

The program correctly handles these cases and the logic seems to cover all scenarios as per the problem statement.

### Correctness: **True**
