The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since the loop will iterate `t` times, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0**. 

Note: The state of the matrix `a` does not need to be adjusted because it is not part of the loop head and does not affect whether the loop will execute.
