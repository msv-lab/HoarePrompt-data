Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve the problem described but has several issues that make it incorrect. Let's break down the logic and the expected solution:

1. **Objective:** The goal is to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix using no more than 2n operations. The optimal strategy involves filling the matrix with the largest possible numbers in the fewest operations.

2. **Strategy:** 
   - **Type 1 Operation:** Fills a row with a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.
   - **Type 2 Operation:** Fills a column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.
   - The maximum sum achievable is when each number from 1 to n appears in each row and column exactly once, which is essentially filling the matrix with a Latin square configuration.

3. **Implementation Issues in the Provided Program:**
   - **Sum Calculation:** The program incorrectly calculates the sum. It should be the sum of all numbers from 1 to n repeated n times, which is \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
   - **Number of Operations:** The program calculates the number of operations incorrectly. It should be exactly \( n \) operations, where each row is filled with a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.
   - **Operation Descriptions:** The operation descriptions are incorrect. The program attempts to create operations that do not fill the matrix optimally.

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - The correct approach is to perform n Type 1 operations where each row is filled with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n].

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)  # Sum of all numbers from 1 to n, repeated n times
        print(max_sum, n)  # Output the maximum sum and the number of operations
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, end=' ')  # Type 1 operation to fill the i-th row
            print(*range(1, n + 1))  # Fill the row with numbers 1 to n

func()
```

Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum or generate the required operations to achieve that sum. It fails to meet the problem's requirements.
