Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the size of an n Ã— n matrix. For each test case, it calculates and prints a sum and a value `n + r`, followed by a series of lines that describe operations to fill the matrix. The matrix itself is not returned or modified; only the described operations are printed.**
