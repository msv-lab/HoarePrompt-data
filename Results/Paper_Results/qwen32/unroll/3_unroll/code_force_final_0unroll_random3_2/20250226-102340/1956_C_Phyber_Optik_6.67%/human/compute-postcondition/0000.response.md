Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. The size of the n × n matrix `a` filled with zeroes, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 500 for each test case, and the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5, remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms, `t` is now the number of test cases read from the input, while the conditions and constraints for the matrix `a` remain the same.
