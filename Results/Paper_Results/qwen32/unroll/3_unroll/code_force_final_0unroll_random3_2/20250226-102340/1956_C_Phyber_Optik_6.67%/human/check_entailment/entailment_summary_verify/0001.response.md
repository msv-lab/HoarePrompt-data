Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summary in the context of the problem description and the original assessment.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the sum of an n x n matrix using no more than 2n operations. The optimal strategy involves filling the matrix with distinct numbers from 1 to n in such a way that the sum is maximized. The maximum possible sum for an n x n matrix is \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), which is achieved by filling each row (or column) with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n].

### Provided Code Analysis

Here's the provided code for reference:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        (sum, r) = (0, 0)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n:
                r = i
                sum += n * (n + 1) // 2
            else:
                sum += i * n
        print(sum, n + r)
        for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
            if j <= n:
                print(1, j, end=' ')
                print(*range(1, n + 1))
            else:
                print(2, j % n, end=' ')
                print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

#### Issues in the Provided Code

1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The code attempts to calculate the sum in a loop with conditional logic that does not correctly compute the maximum possible sum. The correct sum should be \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).

2. **Number of Operations:**
   - The code calculates the number of operations as \( n + r \), where \( r \) is determined by the loop logic. This is incorrect because the optimal solution requires exactly \( n \) operations (one for each row).

3. **Operation Descriptions:**
   - The operations described are not optimal. The code attempts to fill rows and columns with permutations, but the logic is flawed. It should simply fill each row with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n].

### Correct Implementation

The correct approach is to perform \( n \) Type 1 operations, where each row is filled with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n]. Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)  # Sum of all numbers from 1 to n, repeated n times
        print(max_sum, n)  # Output the maximum sum and the number of operations
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, end=' ')  # Type 1 operation to fill the i-th row
            print(*range(1, n + 1))  # Fill the row with numbers 1 to n

func()
```

### Conclusion

The provided code has significant issues in calculating the sum and generating the correct operations. The original assessment correctly identifies these issues and provides a corrected version of the program.

Final: **False**
