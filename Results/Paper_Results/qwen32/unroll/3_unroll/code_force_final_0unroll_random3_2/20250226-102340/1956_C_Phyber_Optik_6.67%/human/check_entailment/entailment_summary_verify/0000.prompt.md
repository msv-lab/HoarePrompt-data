You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        (sum, r) = (0, 0)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n:
                r = i
                sum += n * (n + 1) // 2
            else:
                sum += i * n
        print(sum, n + r)
        for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
            if j <= n:
                print(1, j, end=' ')
                print(*range(1, n + 1))
            else:
                print(2, j % n, end=' ')
                print(*range(1, n + 1))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the size of an n × n matrix. For each test case, it calculates and prints a sum and a value `n + r`, followed by a series of lines that describe operations to fill the matrix. The matrix itself is not returned or modified; only the described operations are printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly compute the maximum sum of the matrix and the corresponding operations. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Sum Calculation:**
   The sum calculation in the program is incorrect. The program tries to calculate the sum by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` for certain rows and `i * n` for others, which doesn't align with the goal of maximizing the sum of the matrix. The maximum sum is simply the sum of the first `n^2` natural numbers, which is `n^2 * (n^2 + 1) / 2`. This is because each cell in the matrix can be set to a unique value from 1 to `n^2` using the operations allowed.

2. **Operations:**
   The operations described in the output are not correctly forming the permutations that would achieve the maximum sum. The program is supposed to fill the matrix in such a way that each row and column is a permutation of the numbers from 1 to `n`. The current implementation does not guarantee this and does not correctly describe the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.

3. **Number of Operations:**
   The number of operations `m` should be no more than `2n`. While the program attempts to generate operations, they are not correctly formed and do not ensure the maximum sum.

### Counter-Example:
Let's consider the case when `n = 2`:

- **Expected Output:**
  - The maximum sum is `7` (which is `1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 7` if we fill the matrix as follows: `[[1, 2], [3, 1]]` or similar configurations).
  - Operations could be:
    ```
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    ```
  - This results in the matrix:
    ```
    1 2
    1 2
    ```
  - Sum = 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6 (incorrect, the correct maximum sum is 7).

- **Actual Output from the Program:**
  - The program outputs `7 3` for the sum and number of operations, which seems correct at first glance, but the operations are not correctly formed.
  - The operations are:
    ```
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    ```
  - This results in the matrix:
    ```
    1 2
    1 2
    ```
  - Sum = 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6 (incorrect, the correct maximum sum is 7).

The program does not correctly maximize the sum and does not correctly describe the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
