You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum cost based on the given conditions: if `n` is odd, it compares `2 * a` with `b` to determine the cost, and if `n` is even, it similarly compares `2 * a` with `b` to decide whether to use `a * n` or `n // 2 * b` for the cost.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it does not correctly calculate the minimum cost when the number of yogurts `n` is odd and `2 * a < b`. Let's analyze the problematic part of the code:

```python
if n % 2:
    if 2 * a < b:
        print(a * n)
    else:
        print(n // 2 * b + a)
elif 2 * a < b:
    print(a * n)
else:
    print(n // 2 * b)
```

In the case where `n` is odd and `2 * a < b`, the program correctly calculates the cost as `a * n`. However, in the else block where `n` is odd and `2 * a >= b`, the program correctly adds one more yogurt at the regular price `a` to the cost of `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price `b`. This is correct.

The issue arises in the `elif` and `else` blocks where `n` is even. The `elif` block is unreachable because the condition `2 * a < b` is already checked in the `if` block. Therefore, the `elif` block is redundant and can be removed. However, the main issue is that the `else` block, which handles the case where `n` is even and `2 * a >= b`, is correct.

However, the `elif` block is not necessary and can be removed. The main issue is that the logic is correct for all cases, but the `elif` block is redundant. However, the code does not handle the case where `n` is 1 correctly because `n // 2` will be 0, and adding `a` will give the correct result, but the logic should be more explicit.

To handle all cases correctly, the code can be simplified as follows:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a)

```

This simplified version correctly handles all cases, including when `n` is 1. The original code does not handle the logic for even `n` correctly due to the unreachable `elif` block, making it incorrect.

Thus, the original program is incorrect.
