Let's go through the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding
Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts. He can buy them either individually at `a` burles each or in pairs at `b` burles per pair. The goal is to determine the minimum cost for buying exactly `n` yogurts.

### Key Points
- If `n` is even, the optimal strategy is to buy `n/2` pairs of yogurts unless `2 * a < b`, in which case buying individually is cheaper.
- If `n` is odd, the strategy is to buy as many pairs as possible (`(n-1)/2` pairs) and then buy the remaining yogurt individually.

### Program Analysis
The program correctly handles the logic described above:
- It first checks if `n` is odd (`n % 2`).
  - If `n` is odd and `2 * a < b`, it calculates the cost as `a * n` (buying all individually).
  - Otherwise, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a` (buying as many pairs as possible and the remaining one individually).
- If `n` is even, it checks if `2 * a < b`.
  - If `2 * a < b`, it calculates the cost as `a * n` (buying all individually).
  - Otherwise, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b` (buying all as pairs).

### Example Walkthrough
- For the third test case (`3 5 11`):
  - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `n` is odd.
  - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`, so it should buy all individually.
  - However, the program correctly calculates `n // 2 * b + a = 1 * 11 + 5 = 16` but since `2 * a < b` it correctly calculates `a * n = 3 * 5 = 15`.
- For the fourth test case (`4 5 11`):
  - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `n` is even.
  - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`, so it should buy all individually.
  - The program correctly calculates `a * n = 4 * 5 = 20`.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
