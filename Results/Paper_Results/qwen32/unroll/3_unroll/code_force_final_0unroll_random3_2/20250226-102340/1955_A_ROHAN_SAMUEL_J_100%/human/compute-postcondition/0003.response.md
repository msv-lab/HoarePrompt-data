Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum cost based on the given conditions: if `n` is odd, it compares `2 * a` with `b` to determine the cost, and if `n` is even, it similarly compares `2 * a` with `b` to decide whether to use `a * n` or `n // 2 * b` for the cost.**
