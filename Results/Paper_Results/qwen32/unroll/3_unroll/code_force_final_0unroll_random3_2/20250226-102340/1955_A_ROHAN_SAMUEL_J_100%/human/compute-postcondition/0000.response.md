In the provided task, the for loop is controlled by the input `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop will execute `t` times. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are mentioned as part of the context for each test case but are not directly part of the loop head.

Given the loop:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't intend to use) and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute as many times as the integer value provided by the input function.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state so that `int(input())` returns a positive integer. Since `t` is already described as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, we need to make sure that the input function returns a value within this range.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to reflect that the input function will return a value for `t` within the specified range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the input function will return `t`**
