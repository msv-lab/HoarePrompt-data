### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts at the "Vosmiorochka" store, considering both the regular price and the promotion price.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic in the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times. For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts on promotion).

2. **Logic for Minimum Cost Calculation**:
    - **Odd Number of Yogurts (`n % 2`)**:
        - If `n` is odd, the program first checks if buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them individually (`b`). 
        - If `2 * a < b`, it calculates the total cost as `a * n` (since buying individually is cheaper for each pair and the last one individually).
        - Otherwise, it calculates the total cost as `n // 2 * b + a` (buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and the remaining one individually).

    - **Even Number of Yogurts (`n % 2 == 0`)**:
        - If `n` is even, the program checks if buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them individually (`b`).
        - If `2 * a < b`, it calculates the total cost as `a * n` (since buying individually is cheaper for each pair).
        - Otherwise, it calculates the total cost as `n // 2 * b` (buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price).

3. **Comparison with Example**:
    - For the test cases provided in the problem description:
        - **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
            - Since `n` is even and `2 * a = 10 > b = 9`, the program calculates the cost as `2 // 2 * 9 = 9`.
        - **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
            - Since `n` is odd and `2 * a = 10 > b = 9`, the program calculates the cost as `3 // 2 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
        - **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
            - Since `n` is odd and `2 * a = 10 < b = 11`, the program calculates the cost as `3 * 5 = 15`.
        - **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
            - Since `n` is even and `2 * a = 10 < b = 11`, the program calculates the cost as `4 * 5 = 20`.

The program correctly handles both even and odd cases and compares the cost of buying yogurts individually versus in pairs to find the minimum cost.

### Correctness: **True**
