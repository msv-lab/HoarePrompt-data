You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:

            print(n // 2 * b)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.

    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30. The program prints the result for each test case based on the given conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum cost based on the given conditions: if `n` is odd, it compares `2 * a` with `b` to determine the cost, and if `n` is even, it similarly compares `2 * a` with `b` to decide whether to use `a * n` or `n // 2 * b` for the cost.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's go through the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding
Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts. He can buy them either individually at `a` burles each or in pairs at `b` burles per pair. The goal is to determine the minimum cost for buying exactly `n` yogurts.

### Key Points
- If `n` is even, the optimal strategy is to buy `n/2` pairs of yogurts unless `2 * a < b`, in which case buying individually is cheaper.
- If `n` is odd, the strategy is to buy as many pairs as possible (`(n-1)/2` pairs) and then buy the remaining yogurt individually.

### Program Analysis
The program correctly handles the logic described above:
- It first checks if `n` is odd (`n % 2`).
  - If `n` is odd and `2 * a < b`, it calculates the cost as `a * n` (buying all individually).
  - Otherwise, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a` (buying as many pairs as possible and the remaining one individually).
- If `n` is even, it checks if `2 * a < b`.
  - If `2 * a < b`, it calculates the cost as `a * n` (buying all individually).
  - Otherwise, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b` (buying all as pairs).

### Example Walkthrough
- For the third test case (`3 5 11`):
  - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `n` is odd.
  - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`, so it should buy all individually.
  - However, the program correctly calculates `n // 2 * b + a = 1 * 11 + 5 = 16` but since `2 * a < b` it correctly calculates `a * n = 3 * 5 = 15`.
- For the fourth test case (`4 5 11`):
  - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `n` is even.
  - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`, so it should buy all individually.
  - The program correctly calculates `a * n = 4 * 5 = 20`.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.
