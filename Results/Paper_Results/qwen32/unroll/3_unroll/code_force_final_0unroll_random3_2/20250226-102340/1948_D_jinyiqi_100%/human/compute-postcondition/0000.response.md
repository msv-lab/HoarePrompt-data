The code snippet converts the input string `s` into a list of its characters. This means that `s` is no longer a string but a list of characters. The other variables `t` (number of test cases) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `s` is a list of characters consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with 1 <= len(s) <= 5000. The total length of all lists `s` over all testcases does not exceed 5000.**
