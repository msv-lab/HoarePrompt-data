The initial state describes a function that either prints a value of the form `2 * j` and terminates, or it does not print anything if no such sequence is found. However, the provided code snippet is a simple `print(0)` statement, which is independent of the described function behavior. 

Since the code snippet directly contains a `print(0)` statement, the output will be the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
