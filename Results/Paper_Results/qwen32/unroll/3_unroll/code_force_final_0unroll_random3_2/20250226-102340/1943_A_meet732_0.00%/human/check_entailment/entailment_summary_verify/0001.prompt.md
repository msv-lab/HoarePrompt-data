You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cntl = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        if cntl[0] == 0:
            print(0)
        else:
            c = min(2, cntl[0])
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if cntl[j] < 2:
                    c -= 1
                    if not c or j == n:
                        print(j)
                        break



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines and prints a specific integer value based on the frequency of elements in the list `a`. The printed value represents the smallest index `j` such that the number of elements in `a` that are less than 2 is exhausted, starting from index 1, or 0 if the first element (index 0) does not appear in the list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
- Alice and Bob are playing a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` (which starts empty).
- Bob wants to minimize the MEX of the array `c`.
- MEX (minimum excludant) is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

### Strategy:
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from `a` and adding them to `c` (Alice adds to `c` and Bob removes from `a`).
- The optimal strategy for Alice is to ensure that as many numbers as possible are included in `c` up to some point, while Bob tries to prevent this by removing elements.
- The MEX of `c` is determined by the smallest number not included in `c`.

### Key Observations:
1. **If `0` is not in `a`:** The MEX is `0` because `0` is the smallest non-negative integer.
2. **If `0` is in `a`:** Alice can always include `0` in `c` on her first turn. Bob can then remove any element. Alice's next move should be to include `1` if possible, and so on. The game essentially revolves around the count of each number in `a`.

### Program Analysis:
- The program starts by reading the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the size `n` and the array `a`.
- It initializes a count list `cntl` of size `n+1` to count occurrences of each number in `a`.
- If `0` is not present in `a`, the MEX is `0`.
- If `0` is present, the program attempts to determine the MEX by considering the counts of each number:
  - Alice can add `0` to `c`.
  - The variable `c` is initialized to `min(2, cntl[0])`, which is a bit unclear but seems to be a heuristic for handling the case when `0` appears more than once.
  - The loop iterates through numbers from `1` to `n`, and for each number, if its count is less than `2`, it decrements `c` and checks if `c` is `0` or if the current number is `n`. If so, it prints the current number as the MEX.

### Potential Issues:
- The logic for determining `c` and the loop that decrements `c` seems overly simplistic and might not correctly handle all scenarios.
- The loop does not account for the optimal strategy of both players in a detailed manner.
- The program does not handle all edge cases or provide a clear and correct method for determining the MEX based on the optimal play by Alice and Bob.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players and does not handle all edge cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players and does not handle all edge cases.
Correctness: **False**
