You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6) consisting of lowercase Latin characters. The sum of the lengths of all strings s over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

            print('NO')
        
    #State: The output state consists of `t` lines of results, each corresponding to a test case. For each test case, the output is either 'NO' if it's not possible to split the string into two non-empty parts such that one part is a prefix and the other is a suffix of the original string and they are different, or 'YES' followed by the number of splits (1 or 2) and the resulting split string(s) if such a split is possible. The state of the input variable `t` and the strings `s` remain unchanged, and no other variables are affected beyond their use within the loop iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters. For each string, the function returns the count of distinct characters in that string.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
