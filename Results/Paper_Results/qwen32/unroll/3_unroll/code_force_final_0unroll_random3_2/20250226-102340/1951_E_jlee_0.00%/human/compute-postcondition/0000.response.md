Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. The first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4). Each of the following `t` lines contains a string `s` (1 ≤ |`s`| ≤ 10^6) consisting of lowercase Latin characters. The sum of the lengths of all strings `s` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of an integer input, which represents the number of test cases. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged as the code only affects the variable `t`.
