Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case is a string of lowercase Latin characters. For each string, it determines if the string can be split into two non-empty parts such that one part is a prefix and the other is a suffix of the original string and they are different. If such a split is possible, it outputs 'YES' followed by the number of splits (1 or 2) and the resulting split string(s). If no such split is possible, it outputs 'NO'. The input strings remain unchanged.**
