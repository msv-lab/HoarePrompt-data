You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    #State: The output state consists of `t` lines of results, each corresponding to a test case. For each test case, the output is either 'NO' if it's not possible to split the string into two non-empty parts such that one part is a prefix and the other is a suffix of the original string and they are different, or 'YES' followed by the number of splits (1 or 2) and the resulting split string(s) if such a split is possible. The state of the input variable `t` and the strings `s` remain unchanged, and no other variables are affected beyond their use within the loop iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case is a string of lowercase Latin characters. For each string, it determines if the string can be split into two non-empty parts such that one part is a prefix and the other is a suffix of the original string and they are different. If such a split is possible, it outputs 'YES' followed by the number of splits (1 or 2) and the resulting split string(s). If no such split is possible, it outputs 'NO'. The input strings remain unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly partition strings that can be split into multiple non-palindrome substrings. Let's consider a specific example to illustrate this:

### Example Case:
**Input:**
```
1
abababa
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
3
aba bab aba
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

### Explanation of the Issue:
The program checks if the string can be partitioned into a single non-palindrome substring or not. However, it does not attempt to split the string into multiple parts if a single partition is not possible. In the example above, the string "abababa" can be split into three non-palindrome substrings: "aba", "bab", and "aba". But the program incorrectly outputs "NO" because it does not consider this possibility.

### Another Example:
**Input:**
```
1
aaabbbccc
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
3
aaa bbb ccc
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

### Explanation of the Issue:
Similarly, the string "aaabbbccc" can be split into three non-palindrome substrings: "aaa", "bbb", and "ccc". However, the program does not attempt such a partition and outputs "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program fails to handle cases where the string can be split into multiple non-palindrome substrings. Therefore, the program is not fully correct according to the problem description.
