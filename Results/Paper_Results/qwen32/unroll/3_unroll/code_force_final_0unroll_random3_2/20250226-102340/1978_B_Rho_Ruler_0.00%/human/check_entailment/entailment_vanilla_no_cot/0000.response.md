Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain. The binary search is not set up properly to maximize the profit, and the `func_1` function does not calculate the profit correctly.

Here is a more detailed explanation:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to find the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the profit.
2. **Profit Calculation**: The profit for a given `k` is calculated as:
   - The sum of the prices of the first `k` buns sold at the modified price: \(\sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - i + 1)\).
   - The price of the remaining \(n - k\) buns sold at the usual price: \(a \times (n - k)\).
3. **Binary Search**: The binary search should be used to find the value of `k` that maximizes the profit, not to check if the profit is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`.
4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - For each test case, iterate through possible values of `k` (from 0 to `n`).
   - Calculate the profit for each `k` and keep track of the maximum profit.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(n + 1):
            profit = sum(b - i + 1 for i in range(1, k + 1)) + a * (n - k)
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        print(max_profit)
```

This program calculates the profit for each possible value of `k` and keeps track of the maximum profit. This approach is straightforward and works within the constraints given. However, for very large `n`, a more efficient approach could be used, such as calculating the sum of the arithmetic series directly.
