Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. The main issue lies in the function `func_1` and the logic used in the binary search. The function `func_1` is supposed to check if a certain number of buns `k` can be sold at the modified price without exceeding the total number of buns, but it incorrectly calculates the profit.

The condition `ans <= n * max(a, b)` in `func_1` does not accurately determine the maximum profit. Instead, it checks if the calculated profit is less than or equal to the product of the number of buns and the maximum price, which is not relevant to maximizing profit.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to calculate the profit for each possible value of `k` and choose the value of `k` that maximizes the profit. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(n + 1):
            profit = (b - k + 1) * min(k, n) + a * max(0, n - k)
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        print(max_profit)
```

In this corrected version, for each value of `k` from 0 to `n`, we calculate the profit and keep track of the maximum profit. This ensures that we find the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the profit.
