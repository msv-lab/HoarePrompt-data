Let's break down the given code and initial state to determine the output state.

Initial State: 
- `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b).
- `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9.
- `ans` is `k * b + (n - k) * a`.

The Python code snippet is:
```python
return ans <= n * max(a, b)
```

Given `ans` is `k * b + (n - k) * a`, we need to check if `ans` is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`.

Since `ans = k * b + (n - k) * a` and `max(a, b)` is the greater of `a` and `b`, we can analyze the expression:

- `k * b` is at most `n * b` when `k = n` and `b >= a`.
- `(n - k) * a` is at most `n * a` when `k = 0` and `a >= b`.

Thus, `ans = k * b + (n - k) * a` is always less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)` because `k * b` and `(n - k) * a` are both contributing to the sum in a way that does not exceed `n * max(a, b)`.

Therefore, the condition `ans <= n * max(a, b)` will always be true.

Output State: **The program returns True**.
