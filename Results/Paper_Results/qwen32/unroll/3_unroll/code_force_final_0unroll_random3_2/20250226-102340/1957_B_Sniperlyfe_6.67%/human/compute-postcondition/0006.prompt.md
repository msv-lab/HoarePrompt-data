You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        
        k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9 (reduced by the sum of the largest numbers representable with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits for each iteration), and `nums` is a list of `n` elements, each being the largest number representable with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits at the time of its assignment.
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` containing `n` elements, where each element except the last one is the largest number representable with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits, and the last element is the largest number representable with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits plus `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the list and `k` is an integer. The function returns a list `nums` containing `n` elements. Each element in the list except the last one is the largest number that can be represented with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits. The last element is the largest number that can be represented with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits plus `k`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `nums` containing `n` elements, where each element except the last one is the largest number representable with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits, and the last element is the largest number representable with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits plus `k`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
