In the provided task, the for loop is controlled by the variable `_` and the function `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the number of test cases provided through standard input. The variable `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we do not plan to use, and `int(input())` will read an integer from the input, which represents the number of iterations (or test cases) the loop should perform.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure that the input provided to `int(input())` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The state of the input is what needs to be adjusted here.

State: **The input to the function `func()` must be a positive integer `n` (representing the number of test cases) such that `n` is at least 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted explicitly.**

Since the problem specifies that there will be multiple test cases, and each test case starts with an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), we need to ensure that the first input provided is a valid integer within this range to start the loop.

State: **The first input to the function `func()` must be an integer `n` such that `n` is at least 1 (and in the context of the problem, `n` will be at least 2 and at most 10^5 for each test case).**
