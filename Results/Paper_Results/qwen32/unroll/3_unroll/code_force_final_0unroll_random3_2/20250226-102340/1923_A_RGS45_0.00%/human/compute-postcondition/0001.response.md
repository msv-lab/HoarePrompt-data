The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since the loop iterates `t` times, the value of `t` is crucial for determining whether the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

Given that `t` is already defined as an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, the loop will definitely execute because `t` is guaranteed to be at least 1. Therefore, no adjustment to `t` is necessary to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000**
