Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly partition strings that contain palindromic substrings in a way that ensures all parts of the partition are non-palindromes.

Let's consider a specific example:

**Input:**
```
1
abacaba
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
3
aba cab a
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
The string "abacaba" is a palindrome, so it needs to be partitioned into substrings that are not palindromes. One valid partition is ["aba", "cab", "a"], where none of the substrings are palindromes.

However, the provided program will output:
```
NO
```

This is because the program incorrectly assumes that if the string is a palindrome, it cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. This is not true, as shown in the example above.

Another issue is with the handling of strings with repeated characters. For example:

**Input:**
```
1
aaaabaaa
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
2
aaa aba
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
The string "aaaabaaa" can be partitioned into ["aaa", "aba"], where neither substring is a palindrome.

However, the program might output:
```
NO
```

This is because the program's logic for handling such cases is incomplete and does not correctly identify valid partitions.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
