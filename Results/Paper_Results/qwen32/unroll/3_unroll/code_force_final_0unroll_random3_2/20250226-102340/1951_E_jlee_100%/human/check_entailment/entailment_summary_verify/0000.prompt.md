You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        string = input()
        s = list(string)
        n = len(s)
        done = False
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        x = s[0]
        if x != s[-1]:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
            continue
        if s.count(x) == n:
            print('NO')
            continue
        elif s.count(x) == n - 1:
            if n % 2 == 1 and s[(n - 1) // 2] != x:

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a string of lowercase Latin characters. For each string, it determines whether it can be split into one or two non-empty substrings such that the first and last characters of the original string do not appear in the same substring, or if the string is a palindrome with specific conditions. It outputs "YES" followed by the number of splits and the splits themselves if possible, otherwise "NO".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly partition strings that contain palindromic substrings in a way that ensures all parts of the partition are non-palindromes.

Let's consider a specific example:

**Input:**
```
1
abacaba
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
3
aba cab a
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
The string "abacaba" is a palindrome, so it needs to be partitioned into substrings that are not palindromes. One valid partition is ["aba", "cab", "a"], where none of the substrings are palindromes.

However, the provided program will output:
```
NO
```

This is because the program incorrectly assumes that if the string is a palindrome, it cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. This is not true, as shown in the example above.

Another issue is with the handling of strings with repeated characters. For example:

**Input:**
```
1
aaaabaaa
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
2
aaa aba
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
The string "aaaabaaa" can be partitioned into ["aaa", "aba"], where neither substring is a palindrome.

However, the program might output:
```
NO
```

This is because the program's logic for handling such cases is incomplete and does not correctly identify valid partitions.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
