Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly handle all edge cases and logic for partitioning the string into non-palindrome substrings. Here are some issues:

1. **Single Character Strings**: The program correctly identifies that a single character string cannot be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings and returns "NO" for such cases.

2. **Strings with All Same Characters**: The program correctly identifies that a string with all the same characters cannot be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings and returns "NO" for such cases.

3. **Strings with Different Characters**: The program attempts to handle strings with different characters but has incorrect logic for partitioning them into non-palindrome substrings. For example, in the third test case (`uwuowouwu`), the program should be able to partition it into non-palindrome substrings, but the current logic does not handle this correctly.

4. **Palindromic Strings**: The program attempts to identify palindromic strings and handle them accordingly, but the logic for doing so is flawed. The program should be able to partition a palindromic string into non-palindrome substrings if possible, but the current logic does not handle this correctly.

5. **General Logic**: The general logic for partitioning the string into non-palindrome substrings is flawed. The program should be able to partition the string into the smallest possible number of non-palindrome substrings, but the current logic does not handle this correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        n = len(s)
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Try to split into two parts
        for j in range(1, n):
            left = s[:j]
            right = s[j:]
            if not is_palindrome(left) and not is_palindrome(right):
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(left, right)
                break
        else:
            # If no valid 2-partition, check if the whole string is not a palindrome
            if not is_palindrome(s):
                print('YES')
                print(1)
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version checks for possible 2-partitions and ensures that both parts are non-palindromes. If no valid 2-partition is found, it checks if the whole string is non-palindrome. If the whole string is a palindrome, it returns "NO".
