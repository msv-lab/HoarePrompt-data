The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a string of lowercase Latin characters. For each string, it determines whether it can be split into one or two non-empty substrings such that the first and last characters of the original string do not appear in the same substring, or if the string is a palindrome with specific conditions. It outputs "YES" followed by the number of splits and the splits themselves if possible, otherwise "NO".
