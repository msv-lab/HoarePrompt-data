The code snippet provided reads an integer `t` from the input. The initial state indicates that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4. After executing the code, `t` will be assigned the value provided by the input, which will still be an integer within the same range. The other variables `a` and `b` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.**
