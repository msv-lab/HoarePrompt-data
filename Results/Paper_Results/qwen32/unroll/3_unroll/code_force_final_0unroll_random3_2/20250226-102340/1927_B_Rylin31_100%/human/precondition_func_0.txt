t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that for each test case, there exists a suitable string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z that corresponds to the given trace a.
