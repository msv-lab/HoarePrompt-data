To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's break down the code and understand what it does.

For each test case:
1. It reads an integer `l` which represents the length of a list `s` initialized with zeros.
2. It reads a list `array` of `l` integers.
3. It initializes an empty string `ans`.
4. It iterates over each value `j` in `array`:
   - It appends to `ans` the character corresponding to the ASCII value `s[j] + 97` (where 97 is the ASCII value of 'a').
   - It increments `s[j]` by 1.

After the inner loop finishes, it prints the string `ans`.

The output for each test case is a string `ans` that is constructed based on the values in `array` and the state of `s`.

Since the code processes each test case independently and the state of `s` is reinitialized for each test case, the output for each test case does not influence the subsequent ones.

Output State: **For each test case, a string `ans` is printed which is constructed by mapping each value in `array` to a character based on the current value in `s` and then incrementing that value in `s`. The state of `t`, `n`, and `a` from the initial state remains unchanged except for the temporary variables `l`, `s`, `array`, and `ans` which are specific to each test case.**

Since the problem asks for the output state after all executions of the loop, and the output for each test case is independent, we can describe the output state as a series of printed strings `ans` for each test case.

Thus, the final output state is a sequence of strings, one for each test case.

Output State: **A sequence of strings, each corresponding to the output of each test case, constructed by mapping each value in `array` to a character based on the current value in `s` and then incrementing that value in `s`.**
