t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and a list of integers a of length n where 0 <= a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that for each test case, there exists a suitable string s.
