You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    maxx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:
                minn = maxx + 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
                maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then computes and prints a specific permutation of the list `a` based on certain rules. For each positive element in the list, it assigns the current minimum non-negative integer not yet used, and for each non-positive element, it computes the absolute difference between the element and the current minimum non-negative integer, updating the maximum value encountered. The function prints the resulting permutation for the given list `a`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly reconstruct the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \) as described in the problem. Let's identify why this is the case:

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The code does not correctly calculate the MEX for the permutation \( p \) being constructed. The MEX of a set of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set. The provided code uses a simplistic approach to determine the MEX, which does not account for the correct logic needed to maintain the MEX as elements are added to the permutation.

2. **Handling Negative Values in \( a \)**: The code attempts to handle negative values in \( a \) by using the absolute difference between the MEX and the current element of \( a \). However, this approach is flawed and does not guarantee a valid permutation \( p \).

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if the input array \( a \) contains negative values that do not correspond to the correct MEX differences, the code will not produce a valid permutation.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

**Actual Output from Provided Code:**
The provided code may not produce the correct permutation for this input or any other complex input due to the incorrect logic for calculating the MEX and handling negative values.

To correctly solve this problem, one would need to maintain a set of used numbers and efficiently compute the MEX for each step. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def find_permutation(n, a):
    used = set()
    p = []
    for i in range(n):
        mex = 0
        while mex in used:
            mex += 1
        p.append(mex)
        used.add(mex)
        used.add(mex + a[i])
    return p

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = find_permutation(n, a)
    print(' '.join(map(str, p)))
```

This corrected version ensures that the MEX is correctly computed and the permutation \( p \) is constructed as required.
