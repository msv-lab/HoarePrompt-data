The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Before the loop starts, the state includes `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `mex`, `minn`, and `maxx`. However, only `i` and `n` can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be set before the loop starts, as it will be initialized by the `range` function.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ a_i ≤ n; `arr` is a list of integers provided by the input; `mex` is an empty list; `minn` is 0; `maxx` is 0**
