The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state mentioned includes `t` as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation `p` for the given data.

After executing the code snippet, `n` is assigned the value of the integer input. The other variables (`t` and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer input; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ a_i ≤ n.**
