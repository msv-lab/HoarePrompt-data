Let's analyze the loop to understand how the variables `mex`, `minn`, and `maxx` change based on the input list `arr`.

1. **Initialization**:
    - `mex` starts as an empty list.
    - `minn` starts as 0.
    - `maxx` starts as 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
    - The loop iterates over each element in `arr` (which has `n` elements).
    - For each element `arr[i]`:
        - If `arr[i]` is greater than 0:
            - The current value of `minn` is appended to `mex`.
            - `minn` is incremented by 1.
            - If `minn` becomes equal to `maxx`, `minn` is set to `maxx + 1`.
        - If `arr[i]` is not greater than 0 (i.e., it is 0 or negative):
            - The value `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is appended to `mex`.
            - If `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`, `maxx` is updated to this new value.

3. **Output State**:
    - `mex` will be a list of integers that are either the value of `minn` at the time of positive `arr[i]` values or the value of `abs(arr[i] - minn)` for non-positive `arr[i]` values.
    - `minn` will be the final value of `minn` after all iterations, which is incremented each time a positive `arr[i]` is encountered and adjusted when it equals `maxx`.
    - `maxx` will be the maximum value encountered during the loop, which is the maximum of `abs(arr[i] - minn)` for non-positive `arr[i]` values.

Given the initial state and the loop logic, the output state can be described as:

Output State: **`mex` is a list of integers as per the described logic, `minn` is the final value of `minn` after the loop, and `maxx` is the maximum value of `abs(arr[i] - minn)` encountered for non-positive `arr[i]` values.**
