The given program is intended to construct a permutation `p` based on the array `a` such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i`. However, the provided code does not correctly implement this logic. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Logic for Positive `a_i`**: When `a_i` is positive, the code appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. This is correct for the case when `a_i` is positive because `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i` implies that `p_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - a_i`, and if `a_i` is positive, `p_i` is the smallest unused non-negative integer, which is `minn`.

2. **Logic for Non-positive `a_i`**: When `a_i` is non-positive, the code appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`. This is incorrect because `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i` implies that `p_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - a_i`. If `a_i` is non-positive, `p_i` is `MEX(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - a_i`, which means `p_i` should be the smallest unused non-negative integer minus `a_i`. However, the code incorrectly computes `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly compute the permutation `p` for all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
