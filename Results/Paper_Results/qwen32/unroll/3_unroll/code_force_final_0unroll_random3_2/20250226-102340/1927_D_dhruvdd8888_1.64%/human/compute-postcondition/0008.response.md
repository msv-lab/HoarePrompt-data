To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which contains the variable `i` and the range `N + 1`. The loop will execute if the range `N + 1` is greater than 0, meaning `N` must be at least 0.

Let's analyze the given state and required adjustments:

State before the loop starts:
- `N` is assigned the value of the first integer read from the input.
- `nums` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array `a` with an additional `-1` at the end.
- `s` is 0.
- `e` is 0.
- `num` is `nums[0]`.
- `arr` is an empty list.

The loop head is:
```
for i in range(N + 1):
```

For the loop to execute:
- `N + 1` must be greater than 0, which means `N` must be at least 0.
- The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts.

Given this, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `N` is at least 0. The other variables (`nums`, `s`, `e`, `num`, and `arr`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

State: **`N` must be at least 0, `nums` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array `a` with an additional `-1` at the end, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is `nums[0]`, `arr` is an empty list**
