The code snippet `LA = len(arr) - 1` calculates the length of the list `arr` and subtracts 1 from it, assigning the result to the variable `LA`. This variable `LA` now holds the index of the last element in the list `arr`.

No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is the first integer read from the input, `nums` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array `a` with an additional `-1` at the end, `s` is the last index where a new segment started, `e` is 0, `num` is `-1`, `arr` is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.**
