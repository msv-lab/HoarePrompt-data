### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of an array and a series of queries. For each query, it aims to find a pair of indices within the specified range that contain different elements. Here is a detailed breakdown of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `N`, the array `nums`, the number of queries `q`, and then the queries themselves.

2. **Segmentation**:
   - The program segments the array into consecutive segments of identical numbers. This is done by iterating through the array and recording the start and end indices of each segment along with the value of the segment.
   - The array `arr` contains tuples of the form `(start_index, end_index, value)`, where `start_index` is the starting index of the segment, `end_index` is the ending index of the segment, and `value` is the value of the segment.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment that starts at or just after the left boundary of the query.
   - It then checks the conditions to determine if a valid pair of indices can be found:
     - If the segment starts after the left boundary of the query, it checks if the previous segment (if it exists) can provide a valid pair.
     - If the segment ends at or after the right boundary of the query, it checks if the next segment (if it exists) can provide a valid pair.
     - If the segment ends within the query range, it prints the current segment's end index and the next segment's start index.
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints `-1 -1` indicating no valid pair exists.

4. **Edge Cases and Conditions**:
   - The program handles cases where the array segments are entirely within the query range, start before the query range, or end after the query range.
   - It also handles cases where no valid pair can be found within the query range.

### Evaluation:

- **Correctness of Segmentation**:
  - The segmentation logic correctly identifies segments of consecutive identical numbers.
  
- **Correctness of Query Processing**:
  - The binary search (`bisect_left`) is used to efficiently find the relevant segment for each query.
  - The conditions for finding a valid pair of indices are correctly implemented.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles cases where the query range is entirely within a single segment, crosses multiple segments, or does not contain any valid pairs.

### Conclusion:
Based on the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It efficiently segments the array and processes each query to find the required indices or determine that no such pair exists.

**Correctness: True**
