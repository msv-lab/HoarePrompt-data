You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array and a series of queries. For each query, it computes and prints a pair of indices based on the segments of consecutive identical numbers within the array. The function does not return a value explicitly but outputs results for each query.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`tc`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array (`N`), the array elements (`nums`), the number of queries (`q`), and the queries themselves.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - The program attempts to preprocess the array to identify segments of consecutive equal elements. This is done by iterating through the array and recording the start and end indices of each segment, along with the value of the segment.
   - The array is extended with a sentinel value `-1` to simplify the loop logic.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment that starts within the query range.
   - The program then checks the conditions to find a pair of indices within the query range that satisfy the condition `a_i != a_j`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Preprocessing Logic**:
   - The preprocessing logic is intended to identify segments of consecutive equal elements. However, the logic used to find these segments is flawed. The program does not correctly handle cases where the segment starts at the beginning of the array or ends at the end of the array.
   - The logic also does not correctly handle the case where the segment spans the entire query range.

2. **Query Handling**:
   - The program's logic for handling queries is not robust. It does not correctly handle all possible cases, especially when the segment identified by `bisect_left` does not fully cover the query range.
   - The program also incorrectly handles the case where the segment starts at the beginning of the array or ends at the end of the array.

3. **Sentinel Value**:
   - The use of a sentinel value `-1` is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results if the array contains the value `-1`.

4. **Debugging Code**:
   - The program includes debugging code that prints the array and query values for a specific test case (`ppp == 23`). This code is not relevant to the correctness of the program and can be removed.

### Conclusion

Given the identified issues, the program does not correctly handle all possible cases and does not produce the correct output for all test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
