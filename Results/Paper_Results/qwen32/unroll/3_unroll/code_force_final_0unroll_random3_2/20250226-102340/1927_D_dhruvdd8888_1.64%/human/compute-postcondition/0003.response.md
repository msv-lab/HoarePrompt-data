The code snippet initializes a variable `s` to 0. This does not affect the values of `N` or `nums`. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`N` is assigned the value of the first integer read from the input, `nums` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array `a`, `s` is 0.**
