The provided code snippet only contains the statement `input = sys.stdin.readline`. This statement reassigns the built-in `input` function to `sys.stdin.readline`, which is a faster way to read input in Python, especially useful for large inputs. 

This change does not affect any variables or values given in the initial state. The initial state described the input format but did not provide specific values for variables like `n`, `a`, `q`, `l`, or `r`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that the `input` function is now `sys.stdin.readline`.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the array a. This is followed by a line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the elements of the array a. Next is an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of queries. Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) representing the boundaries of the query. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The `input` function is now `sys.stdin.readline`.**
