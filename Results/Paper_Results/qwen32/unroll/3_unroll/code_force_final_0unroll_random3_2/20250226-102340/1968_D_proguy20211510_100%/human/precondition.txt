t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n, k, P_B, and P_S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The permutation p is a list of n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once. The array a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
