### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem by simulating the game for each test case. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and whether it correctly implements the problem requirements:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps` which represent the length of the permutation, the number of turns, and the starting positions for Bodya and Sasha respectively.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Path Calculation:**
   - For both players, the program calculates the path they will follow based on the permutation `p` starting from their respective initial positions `pb` and `ps`.
   - It uses a visited array `vis` to detect cycles in the permutation, ensuring that it does not revisit positions unnecessarily.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - For each player, the program calculates the maximum score they can achieve within `k` turns.
   - It does this by iterating through the path and calculating the score for each possible stopping point, taking into account the number of steps remaining (`k - i`).

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After calculating the maximum scores for both players, the program compares them.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, or "Draw" if their scores are equal.

### Analysis:

- **Cycle Detection:** The program correctly identifies cycles in the permutation, which is crucial because the game can potentially enter a loop.
- **Score Calculation:** The program calculates the score for each player by considering all possible stopping points within the `k` turns, which aligns with the problem's requirement to maximize the score.
- **Output:** The program correctly outputs the winner based on the calculated scores.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It handles all necessary aspects, including cycle detection, score calculation, and comparison, to determine the winner of the game for each test case.
