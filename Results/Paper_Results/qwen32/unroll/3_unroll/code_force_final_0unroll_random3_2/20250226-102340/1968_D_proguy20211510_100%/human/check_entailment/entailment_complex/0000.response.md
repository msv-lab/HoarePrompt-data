### Reasoning:

The provided program processes multiple test cases for the "Permutation game" problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of its logic and correctness:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, which represent the length of the permutation, the number of turns, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It also reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Cycle Detection:**
   - For both Bodya and Sasha, the program detects the cycle they will follow in the permutation. It uses the `vis` list to keep track of visited positions to detect cycles.
   - It appends the scores from the array `a` to `pathb` and `paths` for Bodya and Sasha, respectively, until a cycle is detected.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - For each path, the program calculates the maximum possible score. It considers all possible ways to stay or move in each turn up to `k` turns.
   - It uses a cumulative sum approach to calculate the score for each possible sequence of moves and keeps track of the maximum score.

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After calculating the maximum scores for both Bodya and Sasha, the program compares the scores and prints "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" based on which score is higher or if they are equal.

### Verification with Given Example:

Let's verify the program with the first test case from the example:

- **Input:**
  ```
  4 2 3 2
  4 1 2 3
  7 2 5 6
  ```
- **Processing:**
  - **Bodya's Path:**
    - Start at position 3.
    - Score: 5 (from `a[2]`), move to position 2.
    - Score: 5 + 2 (from `a[1]`), stay at position 2.
    - Maximum score: 10 (staying at position 3 for both turns).
  - **Sasha's Path:**
    - Start at position 2.
    - Score: 2 (from `a[1]`), move to position 1.
    - Score: 2 + 7 (from `a[0]`), stay at position 1.
    - Maximum score: 9 (moving to position 1 in the first turn and staying there).
- **Output:**
  - Bodya wins with a score of 10 compared to Sasha's score of 9.

The program correctly computes the scores and determines the winner.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" for multiple test cases based on the provided problem statement and example. 

**Correctness: True**
