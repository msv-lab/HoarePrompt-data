Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, where `n` is the number of elements in lists `p` and `a`, `k` is another integer, and `P_B` and `P_S` are positions. It also receives two lists `p` and `a` of length `n`. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case based on the provided constraints.**
