Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it evaluates two paths starting from given positions in a list and calculates the maximum possible score based on a given number of steps. It then compares the scores of these two paths and prints the result indicating whether "Bodya" wins, "Sasha" wins, or if it is a "Draw".**
