In the provided for loop, the loop head only involves the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the integer value returned by `int(input())`, which represents the number of test cases `t`.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to make sure that `int(input())` returns a value greater than 0. Since `t` is already defined as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, we need to ensure that `t` is set to a value within this range before the loop starts.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, `a`, `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`, `alpha`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure it is greater than 0. Given that `t` is already constrained to be between 1 and 10^4, we can assume that the input will be valid within this range, but for the sake of the task, we will explicitly state that `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
