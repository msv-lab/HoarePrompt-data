Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the solution to the problem described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The program detects cycles for both Bodya and Sasha starting from their respective positions.
   - For Bodya, it starts from `pb` and follows the permutation until it encounters a previously visited position.
   - The same process is repeated for Sasha starting from `ps`.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - For each player, the program calculates the maximum score that can be achieved within `k` turns.
   - It does this by considering all possible points in the cycle and calculating the score if the player stays at that point until the end of the game.
   - The score is calculated as `pre + path[i] * (k - i)`, where `pre` is the cumulative score up to the `i`-th position, `path[i]` is the value at the `i`-th position in the cycle, and `k - i` is the number of turns remaining after reaching the `i`-th position.
   - The maximum score for each player is stored in `resb` for Bodya and `ress` for Sasha.

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - The program compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints "Bodya" if `resb > ress`, "Sasha" if `ress > resb`, and "Draw" if they are equal.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Cycle Detection:**
  - The program correctly detects cycles for both players by using a visited array `vis` to track visited positions.
  - It breaks the loop when a position is visited again, indicating the start of a cycle.

- **Score Calculation:**
  - The score calculation considers all possible positions in the cycle and calculates the maximum score that can be achieved within `k` turns.
  - The formula `pre + path[i] * (k - i)` correctly calculates the score if the player stays at the `i`-th position until the end of the game.

- **Comparison and Output:**
  - The program correctly compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the appropriate result.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the solution to the problem by detecting cycles, calculating the maximum possible scores for both players, and comparing the scores to determine the winner.

**Correctness: True**
