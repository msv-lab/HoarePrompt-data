Output State: **After all iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, and `pres` will no longer hold their values from the last iteration. The variable `t` will be reduced to 0 as the loop has finished executing. The lists `pathb` and `paths` will be empty, and `vis` will be a list of zeros with length `n` from the last test case. The variables `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, and `pres` will hold the final results from the last test case's computations. The values of `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`, and `alpha` will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.**
