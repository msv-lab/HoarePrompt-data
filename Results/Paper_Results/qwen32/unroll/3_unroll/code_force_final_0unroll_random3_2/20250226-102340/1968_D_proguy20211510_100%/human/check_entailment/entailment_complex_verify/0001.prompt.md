You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

    #State: After all iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, and `pres` will no longer hold their values from the last iteration. The variable `t` will be reduced to 0 as the loop has finished executing. The lists `pathb` and `paths` will be empty, and `vis` will be a list of zeros with length `n` from the last test case. The variables `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, and `pres` will hold the final results from the last test case's computations. The values of `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`, and `alpha` will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it evaluates two paths starting from given positions in a list and calculates the maximum possible score based on a given number of steps. It then compares the scores of these two paths and prints the result indicating whether "Bodya" wins, "Sasha" wins, or if it is a "Draw".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The program uses a list `vis` to track visited positions.
   - It starts from `pb` and `ps` respectively, following the permutation `p` until a cycle is detected (i.e., a position is revisited).
   - The values from the array `a` corresponding to the positions in the path are stored in `pathb` and `paths` for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - For each path (`pathb` and `paths`), the program calculates the maximum possible score that can be achieved in `k` turns.
   - It iterates over the path and calculates the score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining turns.
   - The maximum score is tracked in `resb` and `ress` for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After calculating the maximum scores for both players, the program compares them.
   - It prints "Bodya" if `resb` is greater, "Sasha" if `ress` is greater, and "Draw" otherwise.

### Potential Issues:
- **Cycle Handling:** The program correctly identifies cycles and calculates scores based on the values in the cycle.
- **Score Calculation:** The score calculation logic seems correct as it considers the remaining turns and the values in the path.
- **Edge Cases:** The program handles edge cases like `k` being very large by breaking the loop when `k < i + 1`.
- **Variable Naming:** The variable names are descriptive, making the code easier to understand.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles all the given requirements and edge cases appropriately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
