The provided Python code snippet only defines a `TypeVar` named `T`. This does not affect any of the initial state variables `t`, `n`, `v`, or `p`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000; v is a list of n integers where each integer v_i satisfies 1 <= v_i <= 10^9; p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
