Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The code seems to be counting combinations of sticks with the same length and does not check the triangle inequality condition (which is necessary for forming a non-degenerate triangle).

To form a non-degenerate triangle with sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (where \(a \leq b \leq c\)), the triangle inequality must be satisfied:
1. \(a + b > c\)

The provided code does not check this condition. Instead, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks with the same length or combinations of sticks where two are the same and one is different, which does not guarantee that the chosen sticks can form a triangle.

Here is a counterexample:
Input:
```
1
3
0 1 2
```
Expected Output:
```
1
```
Explanation:
The stick lengths are \(2^0 = 1\), \(2^1 = 2\), and \(2^2 = 4\). The only combination is (1, 2, 4), which satisfies the triangle inequality (1 + 2 > 4 is false, but 1 + 4 > 2 and 2 + 4 > 1 are true, so it can form a triangle).

However, the provided code will output 0 for this input because it does not check the triangle inequality condition.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle the triangle inequality condition properly.
