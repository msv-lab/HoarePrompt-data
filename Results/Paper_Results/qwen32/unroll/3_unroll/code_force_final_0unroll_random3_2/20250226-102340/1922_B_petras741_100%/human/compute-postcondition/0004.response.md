Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The function returns a result for each test case based on the provided inputs, where `n` is the number of elements in the list and each element `a_i` is an integer between 0 and `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
