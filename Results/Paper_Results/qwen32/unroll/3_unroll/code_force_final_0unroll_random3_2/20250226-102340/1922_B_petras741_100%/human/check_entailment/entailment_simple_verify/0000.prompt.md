You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The code seems to be counting combinations of sticks with the same length and does not check the triangle inequality condition (which is necessary for forming a non-degenerate triangle).

To form a non-degenerate triangle with sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (where \(a \leq b \leq c\)), the triangle inequality must be satisfied:
1. \(a + b > c\)

The provided code does not check this condition. Instead, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks with the same length or combinations of sticks where two are the same and one is different, which does not guarantee that the chosen sticks can form a triangle.

Here is a counterexample:
Input:
```
1
3
0 1 2
```
Expected Output:
```
1
```
Explanation:
The stick lengths are \(2^0 = 1\), \(2^1 = 2\), and \(2^2 = 4\). The only combination is (1, 2, 4), which satisfies the triangle inequality (1 + 2 > 4 is false, but 1 + 4 > 2 and 2 + 4 > 1 are true, so it can form a triangle).

However, the provided code will output 0 for this input because it does not check the triangle inequality condition.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle the triangle inequality condition properly.
