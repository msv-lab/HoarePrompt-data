Reasoning:
The program provided attempts to solve the problem by finding the minimum length of consecutive subarrays that contain the most frequent element in the array. However, this approach does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The problem requires identifying the minimum number of removals needed to prevent the array from being able to be transformed into an array of identical elements using the specified operation.

The current logic fails to account for the specific operation allowed (replacing an element with its neighbors if they are equal) and instead focuses on consecutive subarrays of the same element. This is not the correct strategy to solve the problem.

Let's consider the example provided:
- For the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the program would incorrectly determine the answer to be `3` (the length of the first subarray of `3`s). However, the correct answer is `3` because removing the first three `3`s results in `[5, 3, 3, 3]`, which cannot be transformed into an array of all `3`s or all `5`s using the allowed operation.

A correct approach would involve:
1. Identifying the longest sequence of consecutive elements that can be potentially transformed into a single value using the allowed operation.
2. Calculating the minimum number of elements to remove such that no such sequence remains.

Given the above, the program does not correctly implement the required logic.

Correctness: **False**
