Let's carefully analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. A beautiful array can be made uniform (all elements the same) by repeatedly replacing an element `a[i]` with `a[i-1]` if `a[i-1] == a[i+1]`. If an array is already uniform, it's impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements, so the answer should be `-1`.

### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to solve the problem as follows:

1. **Input Reading**: It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
2. **Uniform Array Check**: It checks if all elements in the array are the same using a set. If `len(set(a)) == 1`, it prints `-1` because the array is already uniform.
3. **Counting Consecutive Elements**: It initializes `tmp` to the first element of the array and `cnt` to `0`. It then iterates through the array, counting consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp`.
4. **Finding Minimum Removals**: Whenever it encounters an element different from `tmp`, it updates `ans` to the minimum of the current `ans` and `cnt`, resets `cnt` to `0`, and updates `tmp` to the new element.
5. **Final Update**: After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time to ensure the last sequence of elements is considered.
6. **Output**: It prints the value of `ans`.

### Issues in the Program

The program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. Here are the main issues:

1. **Incorrect Approach**: The program incorrectly assumes that the minimum number of elements to remove is the length of the longest sequence of consecutive elements. This is not necessarily true. For example, in the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the longest sequence of consecutive elements is `3` (which appears 4 times), but the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful is `3` (removing the first three `3`s).

2. **Handling Multiple Sequences**: The program does not correctly handle cases where there are multiple sequences of elements. It only considers the longest sequence of consecutive elements, which might not be the correct approach.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, arrays with alternating patterns (like `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`) require a more sophisticated approach to determine the minimum number of removals.

### Correctness

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
