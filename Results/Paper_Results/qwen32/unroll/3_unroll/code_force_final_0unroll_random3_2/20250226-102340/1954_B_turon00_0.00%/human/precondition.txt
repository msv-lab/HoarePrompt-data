t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a list of integers a of length n where 1 <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. Additionally, each array a is guaranteed to be beautiful as per the problem description.
