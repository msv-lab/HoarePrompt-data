Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 24, `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers reflecting 'F' relationships, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers reflecting 'S' relationships, `xx` is a list of `n + 1` strings, where the first string is an empty string and the remaining `n` strings are the input strings, `sa` is a list of indices where there is a 'F' relationship but no 'S' relationship, `sb` is a list of indices where there is an 'S' relationship but no 'F' relationship, and the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.**
