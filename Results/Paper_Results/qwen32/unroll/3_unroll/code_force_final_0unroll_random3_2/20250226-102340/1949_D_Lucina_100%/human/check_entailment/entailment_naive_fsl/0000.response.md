After carefully analyzing the provided program and the problem description, I have identified a few issues that suggest the program does not always meet the requirements.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Handling of `?` Characters:**
   - The program assigns 'F' or 'S' to '?' characters based on the length of `sa` and `sb` lists. However, it does not ensure that the resulting sequence of transition videos adheres to the requirement of not having more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.
   - Specifically, the logic `i in sa[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `i in sb[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sb[:n // 4 - 1]` is not robust enough to guarantee that the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type is met for all permutations of scenarios.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle scenarios where the initial assignment of 'F' and 'S' to '?' characters might lead to sequences that violate the consecutive video constraint.
   - For example, if `n` is large and the initial assignments of 'F' and 'S' are not balanced, the program might end up creating sequences that have more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the following input:
```
8
.???????
?.??????
??.?????
???.????
????.???
?????.??
??????.?
???????.
```
The program might output something like:
```
.FFFFFFF
F.FFFFFF
FF.FFFFF
FFF.FFFF
FFFF.FFF
FFFFF.FF
FFFFFF.F
FFFFFFF.
```
This output violates the constraint because it has 7 consecutive 'F' videos, which is greater than \(\lceil \frac{3 \times 8}{4} \rceil = 6\).

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues and the potential for the program to violate the problem constraints, the program is not correct for all cases.

Correctness: **False**.
