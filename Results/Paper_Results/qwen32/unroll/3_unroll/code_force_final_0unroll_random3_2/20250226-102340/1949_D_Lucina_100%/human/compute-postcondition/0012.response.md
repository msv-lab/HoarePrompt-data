The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, because the loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`. Given that `n` is already defined as an integer such that `2 <= n <= 24`, the loop will definitely execute with the provided `n`.

However, we need to ensure that `i` is correctly initialized before the loop starts. The loop variable `i` should start at 1, and since the loop body is omitted, we don't need to worry about its state within the loop for this task.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 24, `i` is 1**
