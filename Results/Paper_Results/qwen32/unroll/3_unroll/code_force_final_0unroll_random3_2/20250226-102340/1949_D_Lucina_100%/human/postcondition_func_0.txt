The function accepts an integer `n` and an `n x n` matrix where each element is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.'. It processes this matrix to replace each '?' with either 'F' or 'S' based on specific conditions, ensuring that no more than floor(n/2) characters in the entire matrix are 'F' or 'S'. The function then prints the modified matrix.
