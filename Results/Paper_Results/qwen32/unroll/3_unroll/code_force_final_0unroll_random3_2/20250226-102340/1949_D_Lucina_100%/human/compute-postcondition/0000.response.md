The code snippet provided reads an integer `n` from the input. This integer `n` represents the size of the grid described in the initial state. The other parts of the initial state, such as the grid itself and the constraints on the characters within it, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 24, and `n` is assigned the value from the input. The grid and its constraints remain unchanged.**
