Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Handling of Undecided Transitions**: The program does not correctly handle the assignment of 'F' or 'S' to the '?' characters. The logic for assigning 'F' or 'S' is flawed and does not ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type are shown.

2. **List Initialization**: The list `xx` is initialized with an empty string, which is unnecessary and can cause indexing issues.

3. **Logic for Assigning 'F' or 'S'**: The program uses a simple heuristic to assign 'F' or 'S' based on the counts of 'F' and 'S' for each scenario, but this heuristic does not guarantee that the constraint on consecutive videos is satisfied.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when there are no pre-assigned 'F' or 'S' values or when the number of scenarios is small.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is required, such as using a backtracking algorithm to assign 'F' or 'S' to '?' characters while ensuring that the constraint on consecutive videos is satisfied for all permutations of scenarios. This approach is more complex and involves checking all possible sequences of scenarios to ensure the constraint is met.

Given these issues, the provided program is not correct for the problem as described.
