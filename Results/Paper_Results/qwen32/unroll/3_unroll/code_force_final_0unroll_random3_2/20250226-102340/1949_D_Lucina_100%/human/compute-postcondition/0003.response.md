The code snippet `xx = ['']` assigns a new list containing a single empty string to the variable `xx`. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 24, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `b` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `xx` is a list containing a single empty string.**
