You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of four integers p1, p2, p3, p4 (0 ≤ p1, p2, p3, p4 ≤ 200) representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively. The first line of input contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), which is the number of test cases.
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in
    enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
    #This is printed: result1\nresult2\n...\nresultt (where result1, result2, ..., resultt are the calculated values for each of the t test cases)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four integers `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4` representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence, respectively. It then calculates and prints a result for each test case based on these counts. The final state of the program is the printed results, one per line, corresponding to each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code and the problem description to determine the correctness.

### Problem Description Recap
Alice and Bob play a game on a sequence of integers where each integer is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. The game is won by Bob if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero. Eve removes one number at a time, and Bob wants to win as many times as possible. We need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

### Key Observations
1. **Bitwise XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of any number with itself is 0.
   - XOR of any number with 0 is the number itself.
   - XOR is commutative and associative.

2. **Winning Condition**:
   - Bob wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers is 0.
   - Alice wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers is non-zero.

3. **Optimal Strategy for Eve**:
   - Eve should aim to maximize the number of times the XOR of the remaining numbers is 0.

### Analysis of the Code
The provided code calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by evaluating the number of pairs of each type (1s, 2s, 3s, 4s) and the remaining single elements. Here is the code again for reference:
```python
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
```

### Breakdown of the Code
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.

2. **Calculation**:
   - For each count `x` of a number type (1, 2, 3, 4):
     - `x // 2` gives the number of pairs.
     - `x % 2` gives the count of remaining single elements.
     - The expression `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)` seems to be calculating a value based on the number of pairs and the number of single elements.
     - The sum of these values is then divided by 3 to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.

### Potential Issues
The code seems to be using a formula that is not immediately clear from the problem description. Let's test it with the provided examples and some additional edge cases to ensure correctness.

### Testing the Code

   - Input: `1 0 1 2`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Code Output: `1` (Correct)

   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Code Output: `3` (Correct)

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: `3 3 2 0`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Code Output: `3` (Correct)

5. **Example 5**:
   - Input: `0 9 9 9`
   - Expected Output: `12`
   - Code Output: `12` (Correct)

### Edge Cases
1. **All Zeros**:
   - Input: `0 0 0 0`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Code Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **Single Elements**:
   - Input: `1 0 0 0`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Code Output: `0` (Correct)

3. **All Elements Same**:
   - Input: `4 0 0 0`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Code Output: `2` (Correct)

### Conclusion
After testing the code with various inputs, including the provided examples and edge cases, the code seems to produce the correct results. The formula used in the code appears to be correctly calculating the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the counts of each number type.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by evaluating the number of pairs and single elements of each number type (1, 2, 3, 4) and applying a specific formula to determine the result. The code has been tested with multiple inputs, including edge cases, and produces the expected results.
