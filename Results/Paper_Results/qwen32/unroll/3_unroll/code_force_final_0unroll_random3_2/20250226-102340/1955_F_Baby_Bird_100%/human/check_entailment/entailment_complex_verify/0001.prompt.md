You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of four integers p1, p2, p3, p4 (0 ≤ p1, p2, p3, p4 ≤ 200) representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively. The first line of input contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), which is the number of test cases.
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in
    enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
    #This is printed: result1\nresult2\n...\nresultt (where result1, result2, ..., resultt are the calculated values for each of the t test cases)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four integers `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4` representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence, respectively. It then calculates and prints a result for each test case based on these counts. The final state of the program is the printed results, one per line, corresponding to each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze its logic and see if it correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win the game under optimal play by Eve.

### Analysis of the Problem

The game revolves around the bitwise XOR of the sequence. Bob wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins, which means she should aim to leave the XOR of the remaining numbers as zero as many times as possible.

The key insight is that XOR of a sequence of numbers can be influenced by the parity (odd/even) of the counts of numbers that contribute to each bit position. For numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, their binary representations are:
- 1: 001
- 2: 010
- 3: 011
- 4: 100

For each bit position, the XOR will be zero if the count of numbers contributing a 1 in that bit position is even. Therefore, Eve should try to remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers can be zero as many times as possible.

### Strategy

1. **Count Contributions to Each Bit Position**:
   - The number of 1s contributes to the least significant bit (LSB).
   - The number of 2s and 3s contributes to the second least significant bit (2nd LSB).
   - The number of 4s contributes to the most significant bit (MSB).

2. **Calculate the Maximum Number of Bob's Wins**:
   - For each bit position, consider the count of numbers contributing a 1 to that bit.
   - The maximum number of times Bob can win for a particular bit position is the number of pairs of numbers (even count) plus one if there is an odd count.
   - The overall answer is the minimum of these values across all bit positions because Bob wins if the XOR of all bit positions is zero.

### Program Analysis

The given program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win as follows:
- For each test case, it reads the counts of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- It then calculates a value for each type of number based on its contribution to the XOR:
  - For numbers 1, 2, and 3, it calculates `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)`.
  - For numbers 4, it calculates `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)`, but since `i` is not less than 3, the term `x % 2 * (i < 3)` is zero.
- It sums these values and divides by 3 to determine the number of times Bob can win.

However, this approach does not correctly determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. The provided program does not consider the contributions to each bit position independently and does not correctly calculate the minimum number of wins across all bit positions.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the strategy to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win the game. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
