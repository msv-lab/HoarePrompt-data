### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the optimal position to lay a road in a village such that at least half of the residents on each side of the road are satisfied with their side of the village. The solution involves iterating through each possible position of the road and checking if the conditions are met.

#### Breakdown of `func_1`:
1. **Input Reading**: The function reads an integer `n` (the number of houses) and a string `a` (the preferences of residents).
2. **Cumulative Count Calculation**: It constructs a list `S` where each element `S[i]` is a list containing two values: the cumulative count of '0's and '1's from the start of the string up to index `i-1`.
3. **Condition Checking**: For each possible position `i` of the road, it calculates:
   - `left`: The number of '0's to the left of the road.
   - `lsum`: The number of houses to the left of the road.
   - `right`: The number of '1's to the right of the road.
   - `rsum`: The number of houses to the right of the road.
   It then checks if the number of '0's to the left (`left`) is at least half of `lsum` and the number of '1's to the right (`right`) is at least half of `rsum`.
4. **Optimal Position Determination**: If the conditions are met, it updates the answer `ans` to the position `i` if it is closer to the middle of the village compared to the previously found valid positions.
5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the optimal position `ans`.

#### Breakdown of `func_2`:
- **Loop Execution**: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case. It handles multiple test cases by looping through the number of test cases specified in the input.

### Verification:
- **Correctness**: The logic in `func_1` is correct in terms of checking the conditions and determining the optimal position. It ensures that the road is placed such that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied and that the road is as close to the middle as possible.
- **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as when the road is placed before the first house (`ans = 0`) or after the last house (`ans = n`).
- **Multiple Test Cases**: `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. The code efficiently calculates the required position for the road and handles multiple test cases.

**Correctness: True**
