Precondition: **There are t test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, n is the number of people in the queue excluding Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and m is the maximum allowable final position of Kirill in the queue. a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are the costs Kirill has to pay to swap places with the i-th person (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). b_1, b_2, ..., b_n are the additional costs Kirill has to pay to each person between the j-th and i-th person during a swap (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
