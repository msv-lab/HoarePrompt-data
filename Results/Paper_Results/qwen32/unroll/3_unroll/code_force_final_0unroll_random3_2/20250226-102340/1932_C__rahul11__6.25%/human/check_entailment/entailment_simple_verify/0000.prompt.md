You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Output

    0 2 4 1 
    0 0 0 0 0 
    0 0 0 4 4 4

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains a critical error in the way it handles the product of the array elements and the modulo operation. Specifically, the line `ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD` and `ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD` are incorrect because integer division (`//`) does not work as intended in this context, especially when the product is not perfectly divisible by the element being removed. Instead, the program should use modular multiplicative inverses to handle division under modulo.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3 5
2 3 4
LRL
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4 3 1
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Initial product: \(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 = 24\). Remainder when divided by 5 is \(24 \mod 5 = 4\).
- After 'L': Array becomes \([3, 4]\). Product is \(3 \cdot 4 = 12\). Remainder when divided by 5 is \(12 \mod 5 = 2\). However, the program incorrectly calculates this as \(24 // 2 \mod 5 = 12 \mod 5 = 2\), which is correct in this case but can fail in others.
- After 'R': Array becomes \([3]\). Product is \(3\). Remainder when divided by 5 is \(3 \mod 5 = 3\).
- After 'L': Array becomes \([]\). Product is \(1\). Remainder when divided by 5 is \(1 \mod 5 = 1\).

However, consider a more complex case:

**Input:**
```
1
3 5
2 5 4
LRL
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3 0 1
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Initial product: \(2 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 = 40\). Remainder when divided by 5 is \(40 \mod 5 = 0\).
- After 'L': Array becomes \([5, 4]\). Product is \(5 \cdot 4 = 20\). Remainder when divided by 5 is \(20 \mod 5 = 0\).
- After 'R': Array becomes \([5]\). Product is \(5\). Remainder when divided by 5 is \(5 \mod 5 = 0\).
- After 'L': Array becomes \([]\). Product is \(1\). Remainder when divided by 5 is \(1 \mod 5 = 1\).

The program will incorrectly handle the division step, especially when the product is not perfectly divisible by the element being removed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should use modular multiplicative inverses to handle division under modulo. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def mod_inverse(a, m):
    m0, x0, x1 = m, 0, 1
    if m == 1:
        return 0
    while a > 1:
        q = a // m
        m, a = a % m, m
        x0, x1 = x1 - q * x0, x0
    if x1 < 0:
        x1 += m0
    return x1

def func():
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = [0] * n
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans = (ans * i) % m
        res[0] = ans
        c = 1
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = (ans * mod_inverse(arr[l], m)) % m
                res[c] = ans
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = (ans * mod_inverse(arr[r], m)) % m
                res[c] = ans
                r -= 1
            c += 1
        print(*res)

# Uncomment the following line to run the function
# func()
```

This corrected version uses the modular multiplicative inverse to correctly handle the division step under modulo.
