The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50. After executing the code, the value of `t` will be the integer input provided, and it will still satisfy the condition 1 ≤ t ≤ 50. The variable `n` and its conditions remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.**
