Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues:

1. **Character Set**: The problem specifies that the string should be composed of uppercase Latin letters, but the program constructs the string using '1', '1', and '0', which are digits, not letters.

2. **Special Characters Requirement**: The program checks if `n` is even and then constructs a string with '110' repeated. However, the string '110' does not meet the requirement for special characters as defined in the problem. In '110', '0' is a special character, but '1' is not because it has two identical neighbors. The problem requires characters that are special, meaning they must be equal to exactly one of their neighbors.

3. **String Length Constraint**: The problem guarantees that if a solution exists, it can be constructed with a string of length at most 200. The program checks the length of the string, but the logic to construct a valid string is incorrect.

To fix the program, we need to construct a string of uppercase Latin letters where exactly `n` characters are special. One way to achieve this is to use alternating characters and strategically place a single different character to ensure the special condition is met. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('YES')
            print('AB')  # 'A' is special in "AB"
        elif n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            # Construct a string like "AABBAABB..." where the middle two characters are different
            half = n // 2
            s = 'A' * (half - 1) + 'B' + 'A' * half + 'C'
            print('YES')
            print(s)

func()
```

In this corrected version:
- For `n == 1`, we simply print "AB" where 'A' is special.
- For odd `n`, it's impossible to have exactly `n` special characters, so we print "NO".
- For even `n`, we construct a string with alternating 'A's and 'B's, and place a single 'C' to ensure exactly `n` special characters. This construction guarantees that the number of special characters is exactly `n` and the string length is within the required limit.
