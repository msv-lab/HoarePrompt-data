You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: For each test case, if n is odd, the output is 'NO'. If n is even and n // 2 * 3 < 200, the output is 'YES' followed by the string '110' repeated n // 2 times. Otherwise, if n is even and n // 2 * 3 ≥ 200, the output is 'NO'. The value of t and the values of n for each test case remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`. If `n` is odd, it outputs 'NO'. If `n` is even and `n // 2 * 3` is less than 200, it outputs 'YES' followed by the string '110' repeated `n // 2` times. If `n` is even and `n // 2 * 3` is 200 or more, it outputs 'NO'. The values of `t` and `n` for each test case remain unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Create a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly `n` special characters.
2. **Special Character Definition**: A character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
3. **Constraints**:
   - `1 <= t <= 50` (number of test cases)
   - `1 <= n <= 50` (number of special characters required)

### Example Analysis:
- For `n = 6`:
  - A valid string is `AAABAACC`, where the special characters are at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- For `n = 1`:
  - It's impossible to have exactly one special character in a string of uppercase Latin letters.
- For `n = 2`:
  - A valid string is `MM`, where both characters are special.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Logic for Special Characters**:
   - The program checks if `n` is odd.
     - If `n` is odd, it prints `NO` because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string of uppercase Latin letters (each special character requires a pair, except for the edge cases which the program does not handle correctly).
   - If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` using the pattern `'110' * (n // 2)`.
     - This pattern does not meet the problem's requirement of using uppercase Latin letters.
     - The length check `if len(s) < 200` is unnecessary because the length of `s` will always be `3 * (n // 2)`, which is at most 75 for `n <= 50`.

### Correctness:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem's requirements. Specifically:
1. It uses `'110'` instead of uppercase Latin letters.
2. It incorrectly assumes that only even `n` values can have a solution, and it does not handle the edge cases for odd `n` correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
