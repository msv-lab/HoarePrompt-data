The only objects in the loop head are the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and the iterable `test_cases`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases` list. If `test_cases` contains at least one tuple, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, and `results` is an empty list. To ensure that the loop executes, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `x` and `y` are 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and `arr` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9**.

However, since we only need to adjust the state of objects in the loop head for the loop to execute, the only necessary adjustment is ensuring that `test_cases` has at least one tuple.
