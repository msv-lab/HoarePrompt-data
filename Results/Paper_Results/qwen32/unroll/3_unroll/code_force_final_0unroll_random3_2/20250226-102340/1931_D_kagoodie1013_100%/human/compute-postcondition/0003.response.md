Output State: **The program returns `results`, which is a list of integers. Each integer in this list represents the count of valid pairs for the corresponding test case in `test_cases`.**

In simpler terms, the program returns a list called `results`. Each element in this list corresponds to a test case from `test_cases` and indicates how many valid pairs exist for that particular test case.
