Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates and prints an integer value based on the number of elements `n`, a non-negative integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The final output for each test case is a computed value `ans` that depends on the conditions specified within the function.**
