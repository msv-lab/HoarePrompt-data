Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. There is a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the starting node for the single round of the game. `edges` is an empty list. `empty` is True. `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `nodes` has been initialized as a defaultdict of lists, meaning that any key accessed in `nodes` that does not exist will automatically be initialized to an empty list. All other variables retain their initial values.
