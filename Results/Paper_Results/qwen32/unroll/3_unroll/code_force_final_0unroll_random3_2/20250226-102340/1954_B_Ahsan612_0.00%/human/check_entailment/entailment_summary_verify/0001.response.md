Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
The task is to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a "beautiful" array such that it stops being beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it calculates the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer in the list `a`. If no such sequence is found, it prints `-1`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `same`: Counts consecutive identical elements.
   - `num`: Tracks the current number being counted.
   - `minn`: Tracks the minimum count of consecutive identical elements found so far.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The program iterates through the array.
   - If the current element is the same as the previous one (`ar[i] == num`), it increments `same`.
   - If the current element is different (`ar[i] != num`), it updates `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to the current element.
   - It then increments `i` to move to the next element.

3. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, it performs a final check to update `minn` with the last counted sequence of identical elements.

4. **Output**:
   - If `minn` is still `inf`, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

### Function Summary:
The function summary states that the program calculates the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer in the list `a`. This is accurate based on the code.

### Issues in the Program:
The program's logic is flawed because finding the minimum number of consecutive identical elements does not necessarily solve the problem of making the array not beautiful. The problem requires identifying the smallest group of elements that, when removed, would prevent the array from being transformed into an array of identical elements using the specified operation.

### Correctness:
The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. It only finds the smallest group of consecutive identical elements, which is not sufficient to solve the problem as described.

### Example Analysis:
Let's consider the fourth test case from the problem description:
- Input: `7`, `3 3 3 5 3 3 3`
- The program calculates `minn` as `3` (the smallest group of consecutive `3`s).
- However, to make the array not beautiful, you need to remove the `5` and two `3`s around it, which totals `3` elements. This is correct in this specific case, but the logic is not robust for all cases.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
