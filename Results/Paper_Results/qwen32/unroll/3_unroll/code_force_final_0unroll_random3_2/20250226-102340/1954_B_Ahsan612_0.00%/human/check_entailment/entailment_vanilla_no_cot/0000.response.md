Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The program attempts to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful by looking for the smallest sequence of consecutive identical elements. However, this approach is not correct because the condition for an array to be beautiful involves the ability to make all elements the same using specific operations, not just the presence of sequences of identical elements.

For example, consider the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`. The program would find the smallest sequence of consecutive identical elements, which is the sequence of `5` (of length 1), and output `1`. However, removing a single `5` does not make the array stop being beautiful because the remaining array `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]` can still be made uniform using the allowed operations.

The correct approach involves a more sophisticated analysis of the array, considering the structure and the operations allowed. The program should determine if it is possible to break the "beauty" of the array by removing the minimum number of elements, which might involve more complex logic than just finding the shortest sequence of identical elements.
