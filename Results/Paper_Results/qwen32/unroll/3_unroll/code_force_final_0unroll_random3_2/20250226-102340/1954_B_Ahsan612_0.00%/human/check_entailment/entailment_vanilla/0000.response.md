Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a "beautiful" array such that it stops being beautiful. A beautiful array can be transformed into an array of identical elements using the specified operation (replacing `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes a variable `same` to count consecutive identical elements, `num` to store the current number being counted, and `minn` to store the minimum count of consecutive identical elements found so far.
2. **Iteration**: It iterates through the array, updating `same` when consecutive elements are identical and resetting `same` and updating `minn` when a different element is encountered.
3. **Final Check**: After the loop, it performs a final check to update `minn` with the last counted sequence of identical elements.
4. **Output**: If `minn` is still `inf` (which would mean no sequence of identical elements was found, which is not possible given the problem constraints), it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Logic Error**: The program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. The problem requires finding the smallest group of consecutive identical elements that can be removed to disrupt the ability to make the entire array identical using the specified operation. The current logic simply finds the smallest group of consecutive identical elements, which does not necessarily solve the problem.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles arrays with all identical elements correctly (outputs `-1`), but it does not handle cases where the array can be split into multiple groups of identical elements correctly. For example, in the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the program would output `3`, but the correct answer is `3` (removing the `5` and two `3`s around it to make the array not beautiful).

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
