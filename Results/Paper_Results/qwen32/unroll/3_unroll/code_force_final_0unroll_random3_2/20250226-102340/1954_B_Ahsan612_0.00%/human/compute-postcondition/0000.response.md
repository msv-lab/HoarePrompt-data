In the provided for loop, the loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means that the loop will execute based on the integer value read from the input. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable that is not used in the loop body, and the loop will iterate as many times as the integer value provided by the user.

To ensure that the loop executes, the input must be a positive integer. Given the context of the problem, `t` is described as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), which means that the input must be within this range for the loop to execute.

Since the state before the loop starts is `t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, and the loop will iterate `t` times, we need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range to guarantee that the loop will execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
