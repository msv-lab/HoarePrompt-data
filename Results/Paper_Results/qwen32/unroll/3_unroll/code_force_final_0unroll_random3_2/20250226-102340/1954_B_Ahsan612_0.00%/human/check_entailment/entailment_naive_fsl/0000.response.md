Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful.

Let's analyze the provided code and identify the issue:

```python
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1  # This line is incorrect and causes the logic to fail
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        if minn == inf:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
```

The main issue is in the line `i += 1` inside the `else` block. This line causes the index to be incremented twice in consecutive iterations when a different number is encountered, which skips elements and leads to incorrect results.

Consider the following test case:

```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

The correct output should be `1` because removing any one of the `2`s will make the array stop being beautiful. However, the provided program will incorrectly return `2`.

To fix this issue, the line `i += 1` inside the `else` block should be removed. Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        if minn == inf:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
```

With this correction, the program will correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful.
