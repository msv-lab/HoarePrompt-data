You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

Example

    1
    
    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5

    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

        elif flag:
            s[29] = '0'
            s.append('1')
            length += 1
        for i in range(1, length):
            if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
                s[i] = '0'

        print(*s)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each involving a positive integer `x` (where 1 <= x < 2^30). For each test case, it transforms the binary representation of `x` according to specific rules, involving the replacement of consecutive '1's and the handling of a 'flag' state. It then outputs the modified length and the modified binary representation of `x`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not always produce the correct output according to the problem description. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the array elements are either 1, 0, or -1, and it does not guarantee that there are no consecutive non-zero elements.

Let's analyze the code to find the issues:

1. **Initialization and Conversion to Binary:**
   ```python
   s = []
   length = 30
   for i in range(30):
       if x & pow(2, i):
           s.append('1')
       else:
           s.append('0')
   ```
   Here, the program converts the number `x` into a binary string representation, but it stores the binary digits as strings ('1' and '0') rather than integers (1 and 0). This is not a critical issue yet, but it will cause problems later when trying to manipulate these values.

2. **Modification of Binary Representation:**
   ```python
   flag = 0
   for i in range(0, 29):
       if flag and s[i] == '0':
           s[i] = '1'
           flag = 0
       if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and (s[i] == '1'):
           s[i] = '-1'
           flag = 1
       elif flag == 1:
           s[i] = '0'
       else:
           pass
   ```
   This loop is intended to modify the binary representation to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements exist. However, there are several issues:
   - The loop does not correctly handle the conversion of '1' and '0' to integers, leading to incorrect comparisons and assignments.
   - The `flag` mechanism is not robust enough to handle all cases, especially when consecutive '1's are present.
   - The loop does not account for the possibility of needing to append an additional element to the array, which can happen in certain cases.

3. **Final Adjustments:**
   ```python
   if flag and s[29] == '0':
       s[29] = '1'
   elif flag:
       s[29] = '0'
       s.append('1')
       length += 1
   for i in range(1, length):
       if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
           s[i] = '0'
           s[i - 1] = '-1'
   ```
   These final adjustments attempt to fix any remaining issues, but they are not comprehensive and can lead to incorrect results. The use of string comparisons and the bitwise AND operator (`&`) on strings can cause unexpected behavior.

### Example of Incorrect Output
Consider the input `x = 15`. The binary representation of 15 is `1111`. According to the problem description, a valid output could be `n = 5` and the array `[-1, 0, 0, 0, 1]`. However, the provided program might produce an incorrect array like `1111` or `1011` which violates the condition that no two consecutive non-zero elements should exist.

To fix the program, we need to ensure that the array elements are integers and that the logic for modifying the array correctly handles all cases. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        s = []
        for i in range(30):
            if x & (1 << i):
                s.append(1)
            else:
                s.append(0)
        n = 0
        while n < len(s) and s[n] == 0:
            n += 1
        result = []
        i = n
        while i < len(s):
            if s[i] == 1:
                result.append(1)
                i += 1
                while i < len(s) and s[i] == 1:
                    result[-1] = -1
                    result.append(0)
                    i += 1
            else:
                result.append(0)
                i += 1
        print(len(result))
        print(*result)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the array elements are integers and that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist. It also handles the edge cases correctly.
