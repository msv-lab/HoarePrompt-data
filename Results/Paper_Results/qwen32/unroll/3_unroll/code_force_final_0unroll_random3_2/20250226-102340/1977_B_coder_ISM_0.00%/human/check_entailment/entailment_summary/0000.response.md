### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Binary Conversion**: The program starts by converting the integer `x` to its binary representation. This is done by iterating over the 30 bits (since `x < 2^30`), and if the `i`-th bit is set (i.e., `x & pow(2, i)` is true), it appends '1' to the list `s`; otherwise, it appends '0'.

2. **Transformation Rules**:
   - The program then processes this binary string `s` to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.
   - It uses a `flag` to track when a '1' has been replaced with '-1'. If a '1' is found and the `flag` is already set, it means the previous '1' was replaced with '-1', so the current '1' is set to '0' and the `flag` is reset.
   - If two consecutive '1's are found and the `flag` is not set, the first '1' is replaced with '-1' and the `flag` is set.
   - If the `flag` is set and the last element is '0', it is set to '1'. If the `flag` is set and the last element is not '0', the last element is set to '0' and an additional '1' is appended to the list, increasing the length.

3. **Final Adjustment**:
   - The program adjusts the list to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist by swapping '-1' and '1' if they appear consecutively in the wrong order.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the length of the modified list and the list itself.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Length Calculation**: The length of the list is initially set to 30, but it is not adjusted correctly when additional elements are appended. This could lead to incorrect length outputs.
- **Incorrect Binary Conversion**: The binary conversion and transformation logic do not correctly handle the constraints of the problem. Specifically, the transformation rules do not guarantee that the final array will satisfy the conditions of the problem.
- **Incorrect Flag Handling**: The flag handling logic is not robust enough to ensure that the final array will not have consecutive non-zero elements.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The transformation rules and length calculation are flawed, leading to potential incorrect outputs.

### Correctness: **False**
