Reasoning:  
The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads three integers and determines if they form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the given conditions.

The logic for determining the type is correct:
- If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIRS".
- If `a < b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
- Otherwise, it prints "NONE".

However, there is a typo in the output string for "STAIRS". It should be "STAIR" instead of "STAIRS".

Given the typo, the program does not produce the correct output as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
