You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment of two infinite sequences \(a\) and \(b\) where:

- \(a_n = n \oplus x\)
- \(b_n = n \oplus y\)

Here, \(x\) and \(y\) are two distinct non-negative integers. The XOR operation has some interesting properties, and the key to solving this problem is to understand how the sequences \(a\) and \(b\) behave with respect to each other.

### Observations:
1. **XOR Property**: The XOR operation is associative and commutative. For any integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), \(a \oplus b \oplus c = (a \oplus b) \oplus c = a \oplus (b \oplus c)\).
2. **Sequence Behavior**: Since \(a_n = n \oplus x\) and \(b_n = n \oplus y\), the difference in the sequences can be expressed as:
   \[
   a_n = b_n \iff n \oplus x = n \oplus y \iff x = y
   \]
   But since \(x \neq y\), we need to find the longest subsegment where the sequences are equal. This can be analyzed by looking at the XOR of \(x\) and \(y\).

3. **Key Insight**: The length of the longest common subsegment is determined by the highest power of 2 that divides \(|x - y|\). This is because the XOR operation will cycle through all possible values based on the binary representation of the difference.

### Given Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases, and for each pair \((x, y)\), it calculates the absolute difference \(k = |x - y|\). It then determines the length of the longest common subsegment based on the binary representation of \(k\).

Here's the breakdown of the program logic:
- If \(k\) is a power of 2 (i.e., \(k \& (k - 1) == 0\)), the longest common subsegment length is \(k\).
- If \(k\) is odd, the longest common subsegment length is 1.
- If \(k\) is even but not a power of 2, it repeatedly subtracts the highest power of 2 from \(k\) until \(k\) becomes a power of 2, and the result is the length of the longest common subsegment.

### Correctness Check:
Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case (0, 1)**:
   - \(k = 1\)
   - \(k\) is odd, so the longest common subsegment length is 1.
   - Output: 1 (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case (12, 4)**:
   - \(k = 8\)
   - \(k\) is a power of 2, so the longest common subsegment length is 8.
   - Output: 8 (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case (57, 37)**:
   - \(k = 20\)
   - \(k\) is even but not a power of 2.
   - Subtract the highest power of 2 (16) from \(k\) to get 4, which is a power of 2.
   - Output: 4 (Correct)

4. **Fourth Test Case (316560849, 14570961)**:
   - \(k = 301989888\)
   - \(k\) is even but not a power of 2.
   - Subtract the highest power of 2 (268435456) from \(k\) to get 33554432, which is a power of 2.
   - Output: 33554432 (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the length of the longest common subsegment based on the properties of the XOR operation and the binary representation of the difference between \(x\) and \(y\).

Correctness: **True**
