The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This input represents the number of test cases, and its value is now known and specific to the input provided. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this input statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, for each test case n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, c are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.**
