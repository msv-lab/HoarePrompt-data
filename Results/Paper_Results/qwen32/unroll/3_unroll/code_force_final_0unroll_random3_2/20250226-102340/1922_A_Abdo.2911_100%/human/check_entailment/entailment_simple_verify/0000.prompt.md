You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa
    
    10
    
    mathforces
    
    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. The logic in the program is flawed, particularly in the handling of cases where characters in `a` and `b` are different.

Let's analyze the logic of the program:
- The program iterates through each character position `i` of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- If `a[i] == b[i]`, it checks if `c[i] != a[i]`. If so, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
- If `a[i] != b[i]`, it checks if `c[i] == a[i]` or `c[i] == b[i]`. If not, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.

The issue arises in the case where `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]`. The program should set `possible` to `True` in this case as well, but the current logic does not handle this correctly. Instead, it continues to the next iteration, which can lead to incorrect results.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```
Here, for each position `i`:
- `a[i] != b[i]`
- `c[i]` is neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]`

According to the problem description, a valid template `t` could be `T1T2T3` where `T1`, `T2`, and `T3` are uppercase letters. This template would match `a` and `b` (since `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from the lowercase version of `T1`, `T2`, and `T3` respectively) and not match `c` (since `c[i]` is the same as the lowercase version of `T1`, `T2`, and `T3` respectively).

However, the program would incorrectly print `NO` for this case because it does not set `possible` to `True` when `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
