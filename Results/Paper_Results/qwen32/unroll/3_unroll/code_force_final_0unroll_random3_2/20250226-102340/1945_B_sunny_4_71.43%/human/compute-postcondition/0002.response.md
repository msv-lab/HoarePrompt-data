To determine the output state after the loop finishes, we need to understand what the loop does in each iteration. The loop runs `t` times, and in each iteration, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input. It then calculates `A` as `int(m / a) + 1` and `B` as `int(m / b) + 1`. Finally, it prints the sum `A + B`.

Since the loop runs `t` times and prints a value in each iteration, the output state will consist of `t` printed lines, each containing the sum `A + B` for the corresponding input values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.

Given that the initial state only specifies the value of `t` and does not provide the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `m` for each iteration, we cannot determine the exact numerical values that will be printed. However, we can describe the output state in terms of the loop's behavior.

Output State: **t lines of output, each line containing the value of A + B, where A = int(m / a) + 1 and B = int(m / b) + 1 for the corresponding input values of a, b, and m.**
