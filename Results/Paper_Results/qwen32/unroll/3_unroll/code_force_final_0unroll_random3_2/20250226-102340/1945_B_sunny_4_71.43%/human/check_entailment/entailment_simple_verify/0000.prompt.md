You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
One of the days of the hike coincided with a holiday, so in the evening at the
camp, it was decided to arrange a festive fireworks display. For this purpose,
the organizers of the hike bought two installations for launching fireworks
and a huge number of shells for launching.

Both installations are turned on simultaneously. The first installation
launches fireworks every a minutes (i.e., after a, 2 \cdot a, 3 \cdot a, \dots
minutes after launch). The second installation launches fireworks every b
minutes (i.e., after b, 2 \cdot b, 3 \cdot b, \dots minutes after launch).

Each firework is visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a
firework was launched after x minutes after the installations were turned on,
it will be visible every minute from x to x + m , inclusive. If one firework
was launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one
minute.

What is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the
same time?

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow the
descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains integers a , b , m (1 \le
a, b, m \le 10^{18} ) — the frequency of launching for the first installation,
the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky.

Output

For each set of input data, output a single number — the maximum number of
fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

Note

In the first set of input data, the fireworks are visible in the sky for 5
minutes. Since the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and
the second one every 7 minutes, two fireworks launched from the same
installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time. At the same
time, after 7 minutes from the start of the holiday, one firework from the
first and one from the second camp will be visible. Thus, it is possible to
see no more than 2 fireworks simultaneously.

In the third set of input data, 17 fireworks will be visible after 112
minutes:

  * 9 fireworks launched from the first installation at times [56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112 ]; 
  * 8 fireworks launched from the second installation at times [56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112 ].

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        A = int(m / a) + 1
        B = int(m / b) + 1
        print(A + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, a, b, and m are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        A = int(m / a) + 1
        
        B = int(m / b) + 1
        
        print(A + B)
        
    #State: t lines of output, each line containing the value of A + B, where A = int(m / a) + 1 and B = int(m / b) + 1 for the corresponding input values of a, b, and m.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The program simply calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility duration `m` and adds them together, which does not account for overlapping visibility periods between fireworks launched by the two installations.

Let's consider the third example provided in the problem description:

- For the input `7 8 56`, the program calculates `A` as `int(56 / 7) + 1 = 9` and `B` as `int(56 / 8) + 1 = 8`, and then prints `A + B = 17`.

However, the correct answer is `17`, but the explanation given in the problem description shows that there are 9 fireworks from the first installation and 8 fireworks from the second installation, but they overlap at certain points. Specifically, at minute 56, both installations launch fireworks, and these fireworks are visible from minute 56 to 112, inclusive. Therefore, at minute 56, 17 fireworks are visible, but at other times, the number of visible fireworks will be less due to the overlaps.

The program does not account for these overlaps and simply adds the counts, which can lead to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To correctly solve this problem, one would need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and calculate the number of overlapping fireworks within the visibility duration `m`.
