Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. However, the logic in the program is incorrect.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the issue:

1. The program calculates `A` as `int(m / a) + 1`, which represents the number of fireworks from the first installation that could be visible at any given moment. This is based on the assumption that fireworks launched within `m` minutes of each other could overlap. However, this approach does not consider the periodic nature of the launches and the exact overlap points.

2. Similarly, it calculates `B` as `int(m / b) + 1`, which represents the number of fireworks from the second installation that could be visible at any given moment.

3. The program then simply adds `A` and `B` to get the total number of fireworks visible at the same time. This addition does not account for the overlap between fireworks launched from the two installations, which could lead to an incorrect result.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to find the periodicity of overlapping fireworks and then calculate the maximum number of overlapping fireworks within one such period.

Given the incorrect logic, the program does not provide the correct solution for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
