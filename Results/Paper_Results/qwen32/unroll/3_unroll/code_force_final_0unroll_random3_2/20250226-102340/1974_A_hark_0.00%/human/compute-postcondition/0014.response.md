Postcondition: **`x` and `y` are the two integers provided as input, where 0 <= x <= 99 and 0 <= y <= 99. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, either `x` is 0, or `y` is 0, or both are 0, and it is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0. Additionally, it is not the case that `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is equal to 0.**
