Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required for all test cases. Let's analyze the logic in `func_2`:

1. **Case 1: x > 0 and y > 0**
   - The program calculates `bxsfory` as the minimum number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons, which is `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
   - It then calculates `x` as `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. This line is incorrect because it does not properly account for how many 1x1 icons can fit after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - The calculation of `bxsfory1` is also incorrect. It should calculate how many additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons, but the formula is wrong.

2. **Case 2: x == 0 and y > 0**
   - This part is correct. It calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons as `math.ceil(y / 2)`.

3. **Case 3: x > 0 and y == 0**
   - This part is also correct. It calculates the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons as `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

4. **Case 4: x == 0 and y == 0**
   - This part is correct as well, returning 0 screens.

The logic for placing 2x2 icons and then fitting the remaining 1x1 icons needs to be revised. Here's a corrected version of the logic:

- First, determine how many screens are needed for the 2x2 icons. Each screen can fit at most 2 such icons, so use `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
- Then, calculate the remaining space on those screens for 1x1 icons. Each screen can fit 15 - 4*y 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons.
- If there are still 1x1 icons left, calculate how many additional screens are needed for them.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    screens_for_2x2 = math.ceil(y / 2)
    remaining_1x1_space = screens_for_2x2 * (15 - 4 * min(y, 2))  # Each screen can fit 15 - 4*y 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons
    x -= remaining_1x1_space
    if x > 0:
        screens_for_1x1 = math.ceil(x / 15)
    else:
        screens_for_1x1 = 0
    print(screens_for_2x2 + screens_for_1x1)

def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()

# Call the main function to process input
func_3()
```

This revised version should correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for all test cases.
