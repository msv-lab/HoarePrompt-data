Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

Monocarp needs to send invitations to friends such that at least two friends come to the party. A friend will come to the party if both they and their best friend receive invitations. The goal is to find the minimum number of invitations needed for this to happen.

### Key Observations

1. **Minimum Number of Invitations**: 
   - If there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (i.e., `p_i = j` and `p_j = i`), then inviting just these two friends will ensure both come to the party. This is the optimal case and requires 2 invitations.
   - If no such pair exists, then we need to invite at least 3 friends to ensure at least two come to the party. This is because inviting any two friends might not guarantee that their best friends also receive invitations, and thus, they might not come to the party.

2. **Checking for Mutual Best Friends**:
   - The code needs to check if there exists a pair of friends `i` and `j` such that `p_i = j` and `p_j = i`.

### Code Analysis

Let's analyze the provided code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)
```

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of friends and the list of best friends.

2. **Checking for Mutual Best Friends**:
   - The inner loop `for i in range(0, x):` iterates over each friend.
   - The condition `if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:` is intended to check if `p_i` and `p_j` form a mutual best friend pair. However, this condition is incorrect.
   - The condition should be `if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:` to correctly check if `p_i` and `p_j` are mutual best friends.

3. **Output**:
   - If a mutual best friend pair is found, it prints `2`.
   - If no mutual best friend pair is found, it prints `3`.

### Conclusion

The condition `if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:` in the code is incorrect for checking mutual best friends. The correct condition should be `if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:`.

Thus, the provided code is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
