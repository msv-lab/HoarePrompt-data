Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:

The task is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) that maximizes the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). 

The greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. The gcd of \( x \) and \( y \) is always less than or equal to \( y \), and it is also less than or equal to \( x \).

### Program Analysis:

The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads an integer \( x \). It then calculates \( y \) as \( x // 2 \) and prints \( y \).

### Reasoning:

Let's consider the correctness of choosing \( y = x // 2 \):

1. **GCD Considerations**: 
   - The gcd of \( x \) and \( y \) where \( y = x // 2 \) is either \( x // 2 \) if \( x \) is even or 1 if \( x \) is odd. This is because \( x // 2 \) is the largest integer less than \( x \) that can divide \( x \) if \( x \) is even.
   - If \( x \) is even, \( \gcd(x, x // 2) = x // 2 \).
   - If \( x \) is odd, \( \gcd(x, x // 2) = 1 \).

2. **Expression Analysis**:
   - For even \( x \), the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y = (x // 2) + (x // 2) = x \).
   - For odd \( x \), the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + (x // 2) \).

3. **Maximizing the Expression**:
   - For even \( x \), \( x // 2 \) is indeed a good choice because it maximizes the gcd part of the expression.
   - For odd \( x \), \( x // 2 \) might not be optimal because \( \gcd(x, x // 2) = 1 \), which is less than the value of \( y \). However, it is not necessarily incorrect, as the problem allows for any \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

4. **Checking the Example**:
   - For \( x = 10 \), \( y = 5 \), \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10 \).
   - For \( x = 7 \), \( y = 3 \), \( \gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4 \). However, \( y = 6 \) gives \( \gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7 \), which is better.
   - For \( x = 21 \), \( y = 10 \), \( \gcd(21, 10) + 10 = 1 + 10 = 11 \). However, \( y = 18 \) gives \( \gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 3 + 18 = 21 \), which is better.
   - For \( x = 100 \), \( y = 50 \), \( \gcd(100, 50) + 50 = 50 + 50 = 100 \).
   - For \( x = 2 \), \( y = 1 \), \( \gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \).
   - For \( x = 1000 \), \( y = 500 \), \( \gcd(1000, 500) + 500 = 500 + 500 = 1000 \).
   - For \( x = 6 \), \( y = 3 \), \( \gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6 \).

From the above analysis, we can see that the program does not always provide the optimal \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \), especially for odd numbers. For example, for \( x = 7 \), the optimal \( y \) is 6, not 3.

### Conclusion:

The given program is not always correct because it does not guarantee the maximum value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for all test cases, particularly for odd \( x \).

Correctness: **False**
