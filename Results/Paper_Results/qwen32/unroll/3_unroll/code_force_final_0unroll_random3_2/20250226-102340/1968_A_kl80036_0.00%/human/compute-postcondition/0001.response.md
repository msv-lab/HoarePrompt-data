The given Python code snippet consists of a loop that executes `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, an integer `x` is read, and then the integer division of `x` by 2 is printed.

Since the loop does not modify the variable `t` or any other variable outside of its scope, and it only reads and processes the input for each test case, the output state will simply be the results of the integer division of `x` by 2 for each test case.

The output state will not affect the initial state of `t` or any other variables outside the loop. The only changes will be the printed results for each test case.

Output State: **The output state consists of the integer division results of x by 2 for each of the t test cases, printed one per line.**
