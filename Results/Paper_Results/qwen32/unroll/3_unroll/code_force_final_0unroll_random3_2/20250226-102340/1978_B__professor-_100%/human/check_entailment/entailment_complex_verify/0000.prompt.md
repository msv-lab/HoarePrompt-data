You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each of the following t test cases consists of three integers n, a, and b such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))
        
    #State: The output state consists of `t` lines, each representing the result of the expression evaluated for each set of `n`, `a`, and `b` read from the input. Specifically, for each iteration, if `b <= a`, the result is `n * a`. If `b - a >= n`, the result is the integer value of `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`. Otherwise, the result is the integer value of `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` from the initial state remain unchanged except that `t` iterations of the loop have been executed, and the results have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it computes and prints a specific result based on the values of `a` and `b` relative to `n`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the result is `n * a`. If the difference `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the result is calculated using the formula `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`. Otherwise, the result is calculated using the formula `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. Let's analyze the logic of the given code and compare it with the problem requirements.

The code uses the following logic to determine the maximum profit:

1. If `b <= a`, it simply sells all buns at the usual price `a`. This part is correct.
2. If `b - a >= n`, it calculates the profit by selling the first `n` buns at the modified price, which is correct.
3. If `b - a < n`, it calculates the profit as `((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)`. This part is incorrect.

Let's break down the third case:

- The correct approach is to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
- The profit for selling the first `k` buns at the modified price is the sum of an arithmetic series: `b + (b-1) + (b-2) + ... + (b-k+1)`.
- The profit for selling the remaining `n-k` buns at the usual price `a` is `a * (n-k)`.
- The total profit is the sum of these two parts.

The formula `((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)` does not correctly calculate the profit for the first `k` buns. It seems to be calculating the sum of an arithmetic series starting from `b-a` which is incorrect.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

Input:
```
1
5 5 8
```

Expected Output:
```
40
```

Explanation:
- If Bob sells the first 3 buns at the modified price, the profit is `8 + 7 + 6 = 21`.
- If Bob sells the remaining 2 buns at the usual price, the profit is `5 + 5 = 10`.
- The total profit is `21 + 10 = 31`.

However, the program will output `40` which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
