The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it computes and prints a specific result based on the values of `a` and `b` relative to `n`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the result is `n * a`. If the difference `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the result is calculated using the formula `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`. Otherwise, the result is calculated using the formula `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n`.
