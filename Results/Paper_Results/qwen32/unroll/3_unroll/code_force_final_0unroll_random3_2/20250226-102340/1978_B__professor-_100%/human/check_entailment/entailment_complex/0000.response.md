### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the program and see if it aligns with the problem's requirements.

1. **Case 1: `b <= a`**
   - When the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it makes no sense to sell any buns at the modified price because it won't increase the profit. Hence, all buns should be sold at the usual price `a`.
   - The profit in this case is `n * a`.
   - The program correctly handles this case with the condition `if b <= a: print(n * a)`.

2. **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**
   - When the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, it means that selling all buns at the modified price will yield the highest profit.
   - The profit in this case can be calculated by summing up the prices of the first `n` buns sold at the modified prices, which forms an arithmetic series: `b + (b-1) + (b-2) + ... + (b-n+1)`.
   - The sum of this arithmetic series is given by the formula: `n * (2 * b - n + 1) / 2`.
   - The program correctly handles this case with the condition `elif b - a >= n: print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))`.

3. **Case 3: `b > a` and `b - a < n`**
   - In this scenario, selling all buns at the modified price is not optimal because the price reduction would be too significant after the first `b - a` buns.
   - The optimal strategy is to sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified prices, and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price `a`.
   - The profit can be calculated as the sum of the prices of the first `b - a` buns sold at the modified prices plus the profit from selling the remaining buns at the usual price.
   - The sum of the prices of the first `b - a` buns is an arithmetic series: `b + (b-1) + (b-2) + ... + (a+1)`.
   - The sum of this arithmetic series is given by the formula: `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) / 2`.
   - The profit from the remaining buns is `a * (n - (b - a))`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two parts: `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) / 2 + a * n`.
   - The program correctly handles this case with the condition `else: print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all possible cases and computes the maximum profit for each test case as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
