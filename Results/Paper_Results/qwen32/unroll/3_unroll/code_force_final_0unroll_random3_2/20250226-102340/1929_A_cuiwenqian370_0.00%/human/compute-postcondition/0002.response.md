Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a sorted list of integers of length `n` where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `new_arr` is an empty list, `left` is 0.**

In this output state, the variable `left` has been initialized to 0. All other variables (`n`, `arr`, and `new_arr`) retain their initial values.
