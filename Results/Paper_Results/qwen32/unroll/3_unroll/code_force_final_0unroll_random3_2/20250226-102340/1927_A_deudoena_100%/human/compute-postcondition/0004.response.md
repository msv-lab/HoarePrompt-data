The code snippet provided initializes an empty list `l`. The other variables (`ma`, `mi`, `m`, `s`, `c`, `d`) are not modified by this snippet. Therefore, their values remain as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the length of the strip, and the second line contains a string s of length n, consisting of characters 'W' or 'B' where 'W' denotes a white cell and 'B' denotes a black cell. It is guaranteed that there is at least one 'B' in the string s. `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is the input string for the current test case, `c` is 0, `d` is 0, and `l` is an empty list.**
