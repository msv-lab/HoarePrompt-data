The provided code snippet initializes two variables `ma` and `mi` to 0. The initial state describes the input format for the problem but does not affect the values of `ma` and `mi`. Therefore, the values of `ma` and `mi` remain unchanged after executing the given code. The output state will reflect the initial state of `t`, `n`, and `s` along with the initialized values of `ma` and `mi`.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the length of the strip, and the second line contains a string s of length n, consisting of characters 'W' or 'B' where 'W' denotes a white cell and 'B' denotes a black cell. It is guaranteed that there is at least one 'B' in the string s. `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0.**
