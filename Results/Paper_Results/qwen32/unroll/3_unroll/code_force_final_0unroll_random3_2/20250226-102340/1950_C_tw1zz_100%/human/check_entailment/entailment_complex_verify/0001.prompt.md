You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

    #State: For each of the t lines of input times in "hh:mm" 24-hour format, the output will be the corresponding time in "hh:mm AM/PM" 12-hour format.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of time entries, followed by `t` lines of time strings in "hh:mm" 24-hour format. It then outputs each time converted to "hh:mm AM/PM" 12-hour format.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to convert a given time in 24-hour format to its equivalent in 12-hour format. Let's analyze the correctness of the program by examining its logic and comparing it to the requirements.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the time in the format `hh:mm` and splits it into hours `h` and minutes `m`.

2. **Conversion Logic:**
   - The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to map the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format.
   - It correctly identifies the hour and assigns the appropriate period (AM/PM) based on the 24-hour input.
   - For hours from `01` to `11`, it assigns the same hour with "AM".
   - For `12`, it assigns "12 PM".
   - For hours from `13` to `23`, it subtracts 12 from the hour to convert it to the 12-hour format and assigns "PM".
   - For `00`, it assigns "12 AM".

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the converted hour, minutes, and period (AM/PM) in the correct format.

### Potential Issues:

- **Redundant Code:**
  - The conversion logic can be simplified using a more efficient approach, such as using arithmetic operations to determine the 12-hour format and period.
  - However, the current implementation correctly handles all possible cases, so it is not incorrect per se.

- **Output Formatting:**
  - The program uses `sep=''` in the `print` function to ensure that the output is formatted as required, with no extra spaces.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
