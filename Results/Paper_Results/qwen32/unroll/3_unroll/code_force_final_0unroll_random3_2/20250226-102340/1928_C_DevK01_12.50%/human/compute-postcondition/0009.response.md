Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples `q`, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9, and an integer `x`. It returns a list `M` containing the divisors of `n` from each tuple in `q` that are greater than or equal to `x`. However, due to an error in the code, the function will raise a `TypeError` when attempting to compute the square root of `q`, which is a list instead of a number.**
