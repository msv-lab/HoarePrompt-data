The given code snippet initializes an empty list `M`. This operation does not affect the list `q` or any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the new variable `M` which is an empty list.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `M` is an empty list.**
