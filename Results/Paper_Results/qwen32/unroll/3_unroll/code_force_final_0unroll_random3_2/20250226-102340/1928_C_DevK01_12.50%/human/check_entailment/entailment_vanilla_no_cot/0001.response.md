Let's analyze the given problem and the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves determining the number of possible values of `k` such that, given Vasya's position `n` and the number `x` he received, the described "settling" process is valid.

The "settling" process is as follows:
- The first `k` people are numbered `1, 2, ..., k`.
- The next `k-2` people are numbered `k-1, k-2, ..., 2`.
- This pattern repeats every `2k-2` positions.

Given Vasya's position `n` and the number `x` he received, we need to find all possible `k` values that satisfy this condition.

### Key Observations

1. **Pattern Length**: The pattern repeats every `2k-2` positions.
2. **Position and Number**: For a given `k`, Vasya's position `n` and number `x` must match the pattern described above.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it calculates the number of valid `k` values.

Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.
2. **Initial Check**: It calculates `y = n + x` and checks if `y` is even. If not, it prints `0` because the pattern cannot fit.
3. **Finding Possible `k` Values**:
   - It calls `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` to find possible `k` values.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it calls `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` again and adds the results.
   - It removes duplicates by converting the list to a set and prints the length of the set.

### Function `func_1`

The function `func_1(q, x)` finds divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

### Issues and Corrections

1. **Logic Error**: The logic for determining possible `k` values is flawed. The program does not correctly account for all possible `k` values that fit the pattern.
2. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is very large or when `x` is close to `n`.
3. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is correct in finding divisors, but it is not used correctly in the main logic.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified in the program's logic and function usage, the program is not correct for all cases.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly determine the number of valid `k` values for all test cases based on the problem description.
