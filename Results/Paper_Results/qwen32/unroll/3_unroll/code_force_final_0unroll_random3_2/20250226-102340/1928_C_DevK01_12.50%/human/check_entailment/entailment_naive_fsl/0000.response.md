Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the number of valid `k` values for each test case. Here are some specific issues:

1. **Function `func_1` is undefined**: The code references a function `func_1` which is not defined in the provided code snippet. This will cause a `NameError` when the code is executed.

2. **Incorrect logic for determining `k` values**: The logic to determine the valid `k` values seems flawed. The approach used in the code does not correctly map Vasya's position `n` and the number he received `x` to the correct `k` values as described in the problem statement.

3. **Handling of edge cases**: The code does not handle certain edge cases properly. For example, when `n` is very large, the logic might not work as expected due to the way `k` values are calculated.

Let's consider a specific example to demonstrate the incorrectness:

**Example Input:**
```
1
10 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
For `n = 10` and `x = 2`, the valid `k` values are `2`, `3`, `5`, and `6`. The code provided does not correctly identify these values due to the issues mentioned above.

Since the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description and does not handle the cases correctly, it is incorrect.
