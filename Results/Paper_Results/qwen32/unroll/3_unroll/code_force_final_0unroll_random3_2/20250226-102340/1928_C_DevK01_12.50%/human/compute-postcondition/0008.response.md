Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `q`, which is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `x`, which is an integer. The function returns a list `M` containing the divisors of `n` from each tuple in `q` that are greater than `x`.**
