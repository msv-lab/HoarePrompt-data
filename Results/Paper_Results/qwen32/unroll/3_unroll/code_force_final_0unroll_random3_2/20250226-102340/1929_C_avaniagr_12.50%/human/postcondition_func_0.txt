The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers: `k` (the number of times the bet is increased in case of a win), `x` (the maximum number of consecutive losses), and `a` (the initial number of coins Sasha has). For each test case, it determines whether Sasha can continue playing the game without running out of coins based on the given conditions and prints 'YES' if possible, otherwise 'NO'.
