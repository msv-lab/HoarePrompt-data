Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives three integers `k` (2 ≤ k ≤ 30), `x` (1 ≤ x ≤ 100), and `a` (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9), representing the number of times the bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses, and the initial number of coins Sasha has, respectively. The function returns the maximum number of coins Sasha can have after playing the game according to the rules defined by `k`, `x`, and `a` for each test case.**
