The function receives an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the function receives three integers k (2 ≤ k ≤ 30), x (1 ≤ x ≤ 100), and a (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9) representing the number of times the bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses, and the initial number of coins Sasha has, respectively.
