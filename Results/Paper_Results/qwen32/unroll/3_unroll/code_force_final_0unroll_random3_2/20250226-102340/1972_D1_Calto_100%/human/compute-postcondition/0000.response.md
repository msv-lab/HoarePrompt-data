In the given task, the `while` loop condition is `while b:`. In Python, a non-zero integer is considered `True` in a boolean context, and a zero integer is considered `False`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `b` must be a non-zero integer.

Given that the state right before the loop is that `a` and `b` are positive integers, `b` is already a non-zero integer. Thus, no adjustment is needed for `b` to ensure the loop executes. The state of `a` does not affect the loop condition, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers**
