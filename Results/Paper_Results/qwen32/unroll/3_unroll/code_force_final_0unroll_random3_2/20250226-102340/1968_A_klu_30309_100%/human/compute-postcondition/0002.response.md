To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, let's analyze what the provided code does:

1. The outer loop iterates over each integer `x` in the `test_cases` list.
2. For each `x`, it initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1.
3. The inner loop iterates `y` from `x-1` down to 1.
4. Inside the inner loop, it calculates the greatest common divisor (`gcd_val`) of `x` and `y`, and then calculates `current_sum` as `gcd_val + y`.
5. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` to `current_sum` and `best_y` to `y`, and then breaks out of the inner loop.
6. After the inner loop, it appends `best_y` to the `results` list.

Given the `break` statement inside the inner loop, the inner loop will always terminate after the first iteration (since `max_sum` is initially 0 and `current_sum` will be greater than 0 for any `y` in the range). Therefore, `best_y` will always be set to `x-1` because the first `y` checked is `x-1`.

Thus, for each `x` in `test_cases`, `best_y` will be `x-1`, and `results` will be a list of `x-1` for each `x` in `test_cases`.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, test_cases is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, results is a list of integers where each integer is x-1 corresponding to each x in test_cases.**
