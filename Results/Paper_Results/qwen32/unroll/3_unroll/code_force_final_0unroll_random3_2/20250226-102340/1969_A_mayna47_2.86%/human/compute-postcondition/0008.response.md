The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is simply `print(3)`. This means that the code will output the integer `3`, regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `p`, and `v` described in the initial state.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `v`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement directly outputs the integer `3`.

Therefore, the output of the code is:
Output: **3**
