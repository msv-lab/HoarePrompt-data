### Reasoning:

The program is supposed to determine the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure that at least two friends attend the party based on the given conditions. The logic of the program can be broken down as follows:

1. **Base Case (n == 2):**
   - If there are only two friends, Monocarp must invite both of them because they are each other's best friends, and neither can attend without the other being invited. This is correctly handled by the program, which prints `2` when `n == 2`.

2. **General Case (n > 2):**
   - The program checks if there exists a triplet of friends `(i, v[i], v[v[i]])` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. This condition is looking for a cycle of length 3 in the permutation `p` where `v[i]` represents the best friend of the `i`-th friend.
   - If such a cycle exists, it means that by inviting two friends, Monocarp can ensure that at least two friends attend the party. This is because in a cycle of length 3, inviting any two friends in the cycle will result in at least two friends attending (since each of the two invited friends will have their best friend also invited).
   - If no such cycle exists, the program defaults to sending 3 invitations, which guarantees that at least two friends will attend. This is because in any permutation without a 3-cycle, the worst-case scenario is that Monocarp needs to invite three friends to ensure that two of them attend.

### Verification with Examples:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `n = 5`, `p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`
  - Here, `v[v[v[4]]] = v[v[5]] = v[4] = 5` and `i = 4`. This forms a cycle of length 3, so the program correctly prints `2`.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `n = 4`, `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`
  - There is no 3-cycle in this permutation, so the program correctly prints `3`.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `n = 2`, `p = [2, 1]`
  - Since `n == 2`, the program correctly prints `2`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of invitations required based on the given conditions and handles all edge cases appropriately.
