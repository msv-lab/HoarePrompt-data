The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print(2)
```

The `print` statement directly outputs the integer value `2`. The initial state provides information about variables `n`, `t`, `p`, and `v`, but these variables are not used in the provided `print` statement. Therefore, the value to be printed is explicitly given as `2`.

Output: **2**
