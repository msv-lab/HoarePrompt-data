The provided code snippet only reads the number of test cases `t` from the input. It does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, or `m`, as these are only mentioned to be part of the subsequent test case inputs and are not yet assigned or modified by the given code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer; each test case consists of three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` (1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18) representing the frequency of launching fireworks for the first and second installations, and the visibility duration of each firework, respectively.**
