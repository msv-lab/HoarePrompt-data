You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
One of the days of the hike coincided with a holiday, so in the evening at the
camp, it was decided to arrange a festive fireworks display. For this purpose,
the organizers of the hike bought two installations for launching fireworks
and a huge number of shells for launching.

Both installations are turned on simultaneously. The first installation
launches fireworks every a minutes (i.e., after a, 2 \cdot a, 3 \cdot a, \dots
minutes after launch). The second installation launches fireworks every b
minutes (i.e., after b, 2 \cdot b, 3 \cdot b, \dots minutes after launch).

Each firework is visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a
firework was launched after x minutes after the installations were turned on,
it will be visible every minute from x to x + m , inclusive. If one firework
was launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one
minute.

What is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the
same time?

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow the
descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains integers a , b , m (1 \le
a, b, m \le 10^{18} ) — the frequency of launching for the first installation,
the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky.

Output

For each set of input data, output a single number — the maximum number of
fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

Note

In the first set of input data, the fireworks are visible in the sky for 5
minutes. Since the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and
the second one every 7 minutes, two fireworks launched from the same
installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time. At the same
time, after 7 minutes from the start of the holiday, one firework from the
first and one from the second camp will be visible. Thus, it is possible to
see no more than 2 fireworks simultaneously.

In the third set of input data, 17 fireworks will be visible after 112
minutes:

  * 9 fireworks launched from the first installation at times [56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112 ]; 
  * 8 fireworks launched from the second installation at times [56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112 ].

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of three integers a, b, and m (1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18) representing the frequency of launching fireworks for the first and second installations, and the visibility duration of each firework, respectively. The input starts with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases, followed by t lines, each containing the integers a, b, and m for a test case.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)
        
    #State: The output state consists of `t` lines, each line being the result of `m // a + m // b + 2` for the corresponding input values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

The problem asks to find the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. Given two installations that launch fireworks at intervals `a` and `b` respectively, and each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes, we need to determine the maximum overlap of fireworks' visibility periods.

The provided program calculates the result using the formula `m // a + m // b + 2`. However, this formula does not accurately reflect the problem's requirements. Let's break down why:

1. `m // a` counts how many fireworks from the first installation are visible within the first `m` minutes.
2. `m // b` counts how many fireworks from the second installation are visible within the first `m` minutes.
3. Adding `2` to the sum of the above does not account for the overlaps between the fireworks' visibility periods and does not cover the entire time span up to the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` where the maximum overlap might occur.

The correct approach involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the time span within which we need to count the maximum number of overlapping fireworks. Then, we need to count how many fireworks from both installations are visible within any given minute in this span and find the maximum count.

The provided program does not implement this logic correctly, and thus, the formula `m // a + m // b + 2` does not yield the correct result for all test cases.
