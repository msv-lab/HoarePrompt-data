The code snippet `data = input().splitlines()` reads the entire input from the standard input and splits it into a list of strings, where each string corresponds to a line from the input. This means that `data` will now hold the input split by lines, but it does not parse or process the individual test cases further.

Given the initial state, `test_cases` is a list of tuples and `input` is assigned the value of the entire input from the standard input. After executing the code snippet, `input` is no longer used in the code, and `data` is introduced as a new variable.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n (an integer representing the size of the array), x (an integer representing one of Polycarp's favorite integers), y (an integer representing the other favorite integer), and arr (a list of n integers representing the elements of the array); `data` is a list of strings, each string representing a line from the input.**
