test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case and contains three integers n, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9) and a list a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The number of test cases t is between 1 and 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
