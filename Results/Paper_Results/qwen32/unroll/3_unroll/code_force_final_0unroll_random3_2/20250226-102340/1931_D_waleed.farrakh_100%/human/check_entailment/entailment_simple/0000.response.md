### Reasoning

The provided program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and whether it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It reads the input from standard input.
   - It parses the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - It stores each test case as a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` in the list `test_cases`.
   - It calls `func_1` with `test_cases` and prints the results.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.
   - For each test case `(n, x, y, arr)` in `test_cases`:
     - It initializes an empty dictionary `freq` to count the occurrences of pairs of remainders.
     - It initializes a counter `count` to zero, which will store the number of beautiful pairs.
     - For each element `a` in `arr`:
       - It calculates `rx` as the remainder of `-a` modulo `x`, adjusted to be non-negative.
       - It calculates `ry` as the remainder of `a` modulo `y`.
       - If the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in `freq`, it increments `count` by the frequency of that pair.
       - It calculates the current pair of remainders `(a % x, a % y)`.
       - It updates the frequency of the current pair in `freq`.
     - After processing all elements in `arr`, it appends the `count` of beautiful pairs to `results`.
   - It returns the list `results`.

### Verification Against the Problem Description

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array `arr` for each test case. Here are the key points:

- **Remainder Calculation**:
  - The remainder `rx` for `-a % x` is calculated as `(-a % x + x) % x` to ensure it is non-negative.
  - The remainder `ry` for `a % y` is directly calculated as `a % y`.

- **Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
  - For each element `a` in `arr`, the program checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` has been seen before using the dictionary `freq`.
  - If the pair has been seen, it increments the count by the number of times the pair has been seen.
  - It then updates the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The program processes each element in the array once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n) per test case, which is suitable given the constraints.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the required logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
