### Reasoning

Let's meticulously analyze the program to ensure it correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs as per the problem description. We'll focus on the annotations and the logic used in `func_1`.

#### Key Points of the Program

1. **Remainder Calculation**:
   - For each element `a` in the array, the program calculates:
     - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x`: This ensures that `rx` is the non-negative remainder of `-a` modulo `x`.
     - `ry = a % y`: This is the non-negative remainder of `a` modulo `y`.

2. **Frequency Dictionary**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of how many times each pair `(rx, ry)` has been seen so far.

3. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
   - For each element `a` in the array, the program checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` has been seen before in the dictionary. If it has, it increments the count by the number of times that pair has been seen.
   - It then updates the dictionary to include the current pair `(rx, ry)`.

#### Detailed Analysis Using Annotations and Example

Let's use the example provided in the problem description to verify the program's correctness:

**Example Input:**
```
7
6 5 2
1 2 7 4 9 6
7 9 5
1 10 15 3 8 12 15
9 4 10
14 10 2 2 11 11 13 5 6
9 5 6
10 7 6 7 9 7 7 10 10
9 6 2
4 9 7 1 2 2 13 3 15
9 2 3
14 6 1 15 12 15 8 2 15
10 5 7
13 3 3 2 12 11 3 7 13 14
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
0
1
3
5
7
0
```

#### Verification of the Example

Let's walk through the first test case:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - `n = 6`, `x = 5`, `y = 2`, `arr = [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6]`
   - Initialize `freq = {}` and `count = 0`.

2. **Processing Each Element:**
   - For `a = 1`:
     - `rx = (-1 % 5 + 5) % 5 = 4`
     - `ry = 1 % 2 = 1`
     - `(4, 1)` is not in `freq`, so `count` remains `0`.
     - Update `freq` to `{(4, 1): 1}`.
   
   - For `a = 2`:
     - `rx = (-2 % 5 + 5) % 5 = 3`
     - `ry = 2 % 2 = 0`
     - `(3, 0)` is not in `freq`, so `count` remains `0`.
     - Update `freq` to `{(4, 1): 1, (3, 0): 1}`.
   
   - For `a = 7`:
     - `rx = (-7 % 5 + 5) % 5 = 3`
     - `ry = 7 % 2 = 1`
     - `(3, 1)` is not in `freq`, so `count` remains `0`.
     - Update `freq` to `{(4, 1): 1, (3, 0): 1, (3, 1): 1}`.
   
   - For `a = 4`:
     - `rx = (-4 % 5 + 5) % 5 = 1`
     - `ry = 4 % 2 = 0`
     - `(1, 0)` is not in `freq`, so `count` remains `0`.
     - Update `freq` to `{(4, 1): 1, (3, 0): 1, (3, 1): 1, (1, 0): 1}`.
   
   - For `a = 9`:
     - `rx = (-9 % 5 + 5) % 5 = 1`
     - `ry = 9 % 2 = 1`
     - `(1, 1)` is not in `freq`, so `count` remains `0`.
     - Update `freq` to `{(4, 1): 1, (3, 0): 1, (3, 1): 1, (1, 0): 1, (1, 1): 1}`.
     - `(4, 1)` is in `freq`, so `count` is incremented by `1` (since `(4, 1)` was seen once before).
     - Update `freq` to `{(4, 1): 2, (3, 0): 1, (3, 1): 1, (1, 0): 1, (1, 1): 1}`.
   
   - For `a = 6`:
     - `rx = (-6 % 5 + 5) % 5 = 4`
     - `ry = 6 % 2 = 0`
     - `(4, 0)` is not in `freq`, so `count` remains `1`.
     - Update `freq` to `{(4, 1): 2, (3, 0): 1, (3, 1): 1, (1, 0): 1, (1, 1): 1, (4, 0): 1}`.
     - `(3, 0)` is in `freq`, so `count` is incremented by `1` (since `(3, 0)` was seen once before).
     - Update `freq` to `{(4, 1): 2, (3, 0): 2, (3, 1): 1, (1, 0): 1, (1, 1): 1, (4, 0): 1}`.

3. **Final Count for Test Case 1:**
   - `count = 2`, which matches the expected output.

#### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the number of beautiful pairs for the given example and other test cases. The remainder calculations and the use of the frequency dictionary are accurate and efficient.
