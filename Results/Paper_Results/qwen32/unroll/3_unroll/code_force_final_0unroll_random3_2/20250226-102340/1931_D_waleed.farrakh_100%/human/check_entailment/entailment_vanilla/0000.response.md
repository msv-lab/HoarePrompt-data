### Reasoning:

The provided Python program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. The task is to determine the correctness of the program based on the problem statement.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a tuple containing `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `a`.
   - For each test case, it initializes an empty dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a_i % x, a_i % y)`.
   - It also initializes a counter `count` to zero, which will keep track of the number of beautiful pairs.
   - For each element `a` in the array, it calculates `rx` and `ry`:
     - `rx` is the remainder when `-a` is divided by `x`. It is adjusted to ensure it is non-negative using `(-a % x + x) % x`.
     - `ry` is the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in the `freq` dictionary. If it does, it adds the frequency of this pair to `count`, as each occurrence of this pair forms a beautiful pair with the current element.
   - It then updates the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in the `freq` dictionary.
   - Finally, it appends the count of beautiful pairs for the current test case to the `results` list.
   - The function returns the `results` list containing the counts of beautiful pairs for all test cases.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input and processes it to extract the test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to read each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the array `a`.
   - It appends the test case as a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the `test_cases` list.
   - It calls `func_1` with the `test_cases` list and prints the results.

### Analysis:

- The logic for calculating `rx` and `ry` is correct. `rx` is calculated as `(-a % x + x) % x` to ensure it is non-negative, which is necessary for the pair `(rx, ry)` to be used as a key in the dictionary.
- The logic for counting beautiful pairs is correct. The program checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in the `freq` dictionary and adds the frequency of this pair to `count`.
- The program correctly updates the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in the `freq` dictionary.
- The program correctly reads input and processes each test case.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array `a` for each test case. The program reads input, processes it, and outputs the correct results as per the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
