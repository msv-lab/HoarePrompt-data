Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer representing the size of the array), `x` (an integer representing one of Polycarp's favorite integers), `y` (an integer representing the other favorite integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers representing the elements of the array). For each test case, the function returns a result based on the given integers and array.**
