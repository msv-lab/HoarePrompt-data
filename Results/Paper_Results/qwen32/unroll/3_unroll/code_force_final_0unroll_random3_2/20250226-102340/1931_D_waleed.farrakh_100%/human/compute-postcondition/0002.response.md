`t` is assigned the value of the integer conversion of the first element in the `data` list. The `test_cases` list and the remaining elements in the `data` list are not affected.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n (an integer representing the size of the array), x (an integer representing one of Polycarp's favorite integers), y (an integer representing the other favorite integer), and arr (a list of n integers representing the elements of the array); `data` is a list of strings, each string representing a line from the input; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.**
