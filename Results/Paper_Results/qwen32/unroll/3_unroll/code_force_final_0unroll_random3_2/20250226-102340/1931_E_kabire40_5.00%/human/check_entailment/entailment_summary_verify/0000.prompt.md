You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Output

    Sasha
    Anna
    Anna

    Sasha

    Anna
    Anna
    Sasha
    
Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

- Program:
def func():
    for y in range(int(input())):
        rev_val = []
        rev_res = ''
        (list_len, max_power) = input().split()
        operational_list = input().split()
        for x in operational_list:
            x_rev = int(x[::-1])
            if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
                rev_res = rev_res + x
            else:
                rev_val.append(x[::-1])
        rev_val.sort()
        for x in range(len(rev_val)):
            if x % 2 == 0:
                val_in = int(rev_val[x])
                rev_res += str(val_in)
            else:
                val_in = rev_val[x]
                rev_res += val_in[::-1]
        if 10 ** int(max_power) < int(rev_res):
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Anna')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a list of integers and an integer `m`. For each test case, it constructs a new integer by reversing some of the integers in the list according to specific rules and then compares this constructed integer to `10^m`. It prints 'Sasha' if the constructed integer is greater than `10^m` and 'Anna' otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules and logic as described in the problem statement. Here are some specific issues and counterexamples:

1. **Concatenation Strategy**: The program attempts to concatenate numbers in a specific order based on whether their index is even or odd. This strategy does not necessarily maximize the final number, which is crucial for Sasha to win. Sasha should aim to create the largest possible number by concatenating the numbers in an optimal manner.

2. **Reversal Logic**: The program reverses the digits of numbers and concatenates them in a way that does not guarantee the optimal result. For example, if Anna reverses a number, Sasha should then concatenate the numbers in a way that maximizes the final number.

3. **Handling of Leading Zeros**: The program does not explicitly handle leading zeros when reversing numbers, although Python's string slicing and integer conversion should naturally handle this. However, the logic for concatenation needs to be more robust.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if there is only one number in the list, the game ends immediately, and the result depends on whether that number is greater than or equal to \(10^m\).

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness:

**Input:**
```
1
3 5
9 56 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Anna
```

**Explanation:**
- Anna can reverse any number, but let's assume she reverses 1 to 1 (no change).
- Sasha can then concatenate 9 and 56 to form 956 or 569.
- Sasha can then concatenate the result with 1 to form 9561 or 5691 or 9156 or 1956.
- The largest possible number is 9561, which is less than \(10^5 = 100000\), so Anna wins.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
The program might not handle this correctly and could potentially output "Sasha" due to its flawed concatenation strategy.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not guarantee the optimal play for Sasha and Anna as described in the problem statement.
