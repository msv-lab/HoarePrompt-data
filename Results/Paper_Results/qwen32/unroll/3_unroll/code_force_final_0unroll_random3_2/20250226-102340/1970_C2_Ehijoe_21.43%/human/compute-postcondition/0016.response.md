Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `nodes`, which is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing the neighbors of the corresponding node; `start`, which is an integer representing the starting node of the game; and `moves`, which is a list of integers representing the number of moves required to reach each node from the starting node. The function returns the number of moves required to reach each node from the starting node as specified in the `moves` list.**
