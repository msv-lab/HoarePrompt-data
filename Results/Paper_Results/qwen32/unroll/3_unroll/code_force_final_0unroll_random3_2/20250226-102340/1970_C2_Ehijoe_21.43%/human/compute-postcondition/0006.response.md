The code snippet initializes a `deque` named `leaves`. This does not affect any of the other variables (`nodes`, `start`, `moves`, `n`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`). Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the new `leaves` variable.

Output State: **`nodes` is a defaultdict where each key is a node (integer) and each value is a list of integers representing the neighboring nodes; `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game; `moves` is a list of integers representing the number of moves required to reach each node from the starting node; `n` is the first integer from the input; `t` is the second integer from the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `leaves` is an empty deque.**
