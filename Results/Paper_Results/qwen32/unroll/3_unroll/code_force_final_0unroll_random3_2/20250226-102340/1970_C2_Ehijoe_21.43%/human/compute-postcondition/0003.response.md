The code snippet `nodes = defaultdict(list)` reassigns the `nodes` variable to a new `defaultdict` object where the default value for any key is an empty list. This means that if a key is accessed that does not exist, it will automatically be created with an empty list as its value.

The other variables (`start`, `moves`, `n`, `t`, `edges`, and `empty`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes` is a defaultdict where keys are integers and values are lists of integers; `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game; `moves` is a list of integers representing the number of moves required to reach each node from the starting node; `n` is the first integer from the input; `t` is the second integer from the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True.**
