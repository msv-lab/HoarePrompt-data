The code reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `t`. The initial state of `nodes`, `start`, and `moves` is unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`nodes` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing the neighbors of the corresponding node, `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game, `moves` is a list of integers representing the number of moves required to reach each node from the starting node, `n` is the first integer from the input, `t` is the second integer from the input.**
