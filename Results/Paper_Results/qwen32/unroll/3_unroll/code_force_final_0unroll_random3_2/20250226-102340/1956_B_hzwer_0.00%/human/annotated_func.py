#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of cards each player receives. The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    cards = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [([0] * (n + 1)) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[n - 1][0] = 0
    dp[n - 2][0] = 0
    for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):
        for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
            elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])
        
    #State: `n` is an integer input representing the number of cards each player receives; `cards` is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the integers on the cards in your hand; `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where each element is filled according to the rules specified in the loop.
    return dp[0][0]
    #The program returns the value of `dp[0][0]`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of cards and a list of `n` integers representing the values on the cards. It calculates and returns a value based on a dynamic programming approach, specifically the value of `dp[0][0]` which seems to represent the optimal score or result for the given set of cards.
