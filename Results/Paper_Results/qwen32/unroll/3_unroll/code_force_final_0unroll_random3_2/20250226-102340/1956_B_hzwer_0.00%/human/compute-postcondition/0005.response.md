To determine the state required for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which is `for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1)`. This loop will iterate over the variable `i` starting from `n - 3` down to `0`.

Let's break down the requirements:

1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if the starting value `n - 3` is greater than or equal to the ending value `-1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n - 3` must be greater than or equal to `0`. This implies that `n` must be at least `3`.

2. **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` is the loop variable and will start at `n - 3` and decrement by `1` in each iteration until it reaches `-1`. Before the loop starts, `i` does not need to be set to any specific value because it is initialized by the `range` function.

3. **Variable `n`**: As discussed, `n` must be at least `3` for the loop to execute.

4. **List `cards` and `dp`**: The variables `cards` and `dp` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, they are part of the program state, so we should keep them as they are described in the initial state.

Given these requirements, the adjusted state before the loop starts should be:

State: **`n` is an integer input representing the number of cards each player receives, where `n` must be at least 3; `cards` is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the integers on the cards in your hand; `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where each element is `0` except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is `0` and `dp[n - 2][0]` is `0`.**
