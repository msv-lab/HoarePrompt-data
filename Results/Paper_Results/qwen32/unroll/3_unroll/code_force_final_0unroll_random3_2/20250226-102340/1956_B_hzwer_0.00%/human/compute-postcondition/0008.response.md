Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of cards each player receives, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the integers on the cards in your hand. The function returns the value of `dp[0][0]` for each test case.**
