Output State: **`n` is an integer input representing the number of cards each player receives. The next line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 through `n` appears in the sequence `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` at most 2 times. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 Â· 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of the first integer input, which represents the number of cards. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged as the code snippet provided only reads the value of `n` and does not affect any other variables or conditions.
