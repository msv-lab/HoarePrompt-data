The code snippet reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers, which are assigned to the variable `cards`. This means that the variable `cards` will now hold the list of integers representing the integers on the cards in your hand.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input representing the number of cards each player receives; `cards` is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the integers on the cards in your hand.**
