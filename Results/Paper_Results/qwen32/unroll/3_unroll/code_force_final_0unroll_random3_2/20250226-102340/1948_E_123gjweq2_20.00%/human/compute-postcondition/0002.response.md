The code calculates the midpoint between `big_element` and `small_element` and assigns it to the variable `mid`. Given the initial state, we know that `small_element` is `left + 1` and `big_element` is `right + 1`. Therefore, `mid` will be calculated as:

\[ \text{mid} = \left(\text{big\_element} - \text{small\_element}\right) // 2 = \left((\text{right} + 1) - (\text{left} + 1)\right) // 2 = (\text{right} - \text{left}) // 2 \]

The variables `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, and `big_element` remain unchanged. The only new variable introduced is `mid`, which is calculated as described.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr), `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`.**
