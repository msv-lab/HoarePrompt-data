The value of `not_mid` is assigned the result of the expression `right - left + 1 - mid`. Given the initial state, `mid` is calculated as `(right - left) // 2`. Therefore, `not_mid` can be expressed as `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr), `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`.**
