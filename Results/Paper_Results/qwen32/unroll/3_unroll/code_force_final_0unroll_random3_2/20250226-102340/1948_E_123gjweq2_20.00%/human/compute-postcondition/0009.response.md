Functionality: **The function `make_array` modifies a portion of the array `arr` between the indices `left` and `right` by setting the first half to increasing values starting from `left + 1` and the second half to decreasing values starting from `right + 1`. It also sets the corresponding elements in the `cliquess` array to the given `clique` number.**
