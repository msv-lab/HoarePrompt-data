Let's analyze the given loop and determine the output state after it has executed all its iterations.

### Initial State Recap:
- `left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr).
- `clique` is an integer representing the clique number.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`.
- `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`.
- `arr[left]` to `arr[left + mid - 1]` are set to `small_element`, `small_element + 1`, ..., `small_element + mid - 1`.
- `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are set to `clique`.

### Loop Code Recap:
```python
for i in range(not_mid):
    arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
    cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
```

### Analysis:
- The loop runs `not_mid` times.
- In each iteration, `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `big_element - i`.
- In each iteration, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is set to `clique`.

### Calculation:
- `not_mid` is the number of elements in the second half of the array segment from `left` to `right`.
- The loop fills the second half of the array segment (`arr[left + mid]` to `arr[right]`) with values starting from `big_element` and decreasing by 1 in each subsequent position.
- `cliquess` is filled with `clique` for the same positions.

### Output State:
- `arr[left]` to `arr[left + mid - 1]` remains `small_element`, `small_element + 1`, ..., `small_element + mid - 1`.
- `arr[left + mid]` to `arr[right]` becomes `big_element`, `big_element - 1`, ..., `big_element - (not_mid - 1)`.
- `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` remains `clique`.
- `cliquess[left + mid]` to `cliquess[right]` becomes `clique`.

### Natural Language Description:
- The first half of the array segment from `left` to `right` remains unchanged, with values increasing from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`.
- The second half of the array segment from `left + mid` to `right` is filled with values starting from `big_element` and decreasing by 1 in each subsequent position.
- The `cliquess` array is filled with `clique` for all positions from `left` to `right`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`arr[left]` to `arr[left + mid - 1]` are `small_element`, `small_element + 1`, ..., `small_element + mid - 1`, `arr[left + mid]` to `arr[right]` are `big_element`, `big_element - 1`, ..., `big_element - (not_mid - 1)`, `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[right]` are all `clique`.**
