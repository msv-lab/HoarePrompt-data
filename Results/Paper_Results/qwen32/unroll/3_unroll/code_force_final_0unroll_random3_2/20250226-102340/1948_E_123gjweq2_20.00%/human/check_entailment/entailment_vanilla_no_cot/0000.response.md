Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Global Variables**: The `arr` and `cliquess` arrays are used within the `make_array` function, but they are not defined in the scope of that function. They are defined in `func_1`, but `make_array` does not have access to them unless they are passed as arguments or defined globally. This will lead to a `NameError`.

2. **Logic for Assigning Values**: The logic for assigning values to `arr` and `cliquess` in `make_array` is incorrect. The assignment of `arr` and `cliquess` should be based on the problem's requirement that for every pair of vertices (i, j), an edge is added if `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`. The current logic does not ensure this condition.

3. **Number of Cliques**: The calculation of the number of cliques using `ceil(n / k)` might not be optimal. The problem requires the minimum number of cliques, which might not necessarily be `ceil(n / k)`.

4. **Output Format**: The output format should match the problem's requirements, which it does not currently. The function `func_1` prints the results directly, which is not ideal as the problem requires handling multiple test cases and returning the results for each test case.

5. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. It should read all test cases first and then process each one, collecting the results and printing them at the end.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
from math import ceil

def solve(n, k):
    arr = list(range(1, n + 1))
    cliques = []
    clique_index = 1
    
    for i in range(n):
        if not cliques or not all(abs(i + 1 - j) + abs(arr[i] - arr[j - 1]) <= k for j in cliques[-1]):
            cliques.append([i + 1])
            clique_index += 1
        else:
            for clique in cliques:
                if all(abs(i + 1 - j) + abs(arr[i] - arr[j - 1]) <= k for j in clique):
                    clique.append(i + 1)
                    break
    
    q = len(cliques)
    c = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j, clique in enumerate(cliques):
            if i + 1 in clique:
                c.append(j + 1)
                break
    
    return arr, q, c

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    t_index = 0
    t = int(input[t_index])
    t_index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[t_index])
        k = int(input[t_index + 1])
        t_index += 2
        arr, q, c = solve(n, k)
        results.append((arr, q, c))
    
    for arr, q, c in results:
        print(*arr)
        print(q)
        print(*c)

# Uncomment the following line to run the main function
# main()
```

This program reads all test cases, processes each one to find the correct assignment of values and the partition into cliques, and then prints the results for each test case.
