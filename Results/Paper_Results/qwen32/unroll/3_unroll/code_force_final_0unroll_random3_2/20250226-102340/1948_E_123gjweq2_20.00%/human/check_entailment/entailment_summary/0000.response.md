### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its execution summaries to evaluate if it correctly meets the problem requirements.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: To create and print the required array `a`, the number of cliques `q`, and the partition `c` for a given `n` and `k`.
   - **Execution Summary**:
     - It calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
     - Initializes two arrays `arr` and `cliquess` of size `n` with zeros.
     - Iterates over the number of cliques and calls `make_array` for each segment.
     - Prints the array `arr`, the number of cliques, and the `cliquess` array.
   - **Issues**:
     - The function uses global variables `arr` and `cliquess` without defining them within the function or passing them as arguments. This is problematic as it assumes these variables exist outside the function.
     - The function prints the arrays directly without ensuring that the resulting graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques as per the problem's requirements.

2. **Function `make_array`**:
   - **Purpose**: To populate a segment of `arr` and `cliquess` with values such that the resulting graph can be partitioned into cliques.
   - **Execution Summary**:
     - It fills the first half of the segment with increasing values starting from `left + 1`.
     - It fills the second half of the segment with decreasing values starting from `right + 1`.
     - It assigns the same clique number to all elements in the segment.
   - **Issues**:
     - Similar to `func_1`, it assumes the existence of global variables `arr` and `cliquess`.
     - The method of filling the array does not ensure that the graph formed can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. The condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` must be satisfied for all pairs of vertices in the same clique, which is not guaranteed by this approach.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The main issues are the incorrect logic for partitioning the graph into the minimum number of cliques and the use of global variables without proper definition and management. The code does not ensure that the resulting graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques, which is a core requirement of the problem.

**Correctness: False**
