### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem by determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. Let's break down the logic and see if it aligns with the problem's requirements.

1. **Initial Check for Uniformity**:
   - The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it sets `flag` to `True`. Otherwise, it sets `flag` to `False`.
   - If `flag` is `True` (all elements are the same), the program outputs `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.

2. **Finding the Minimum Sequence Length**:
   - The program then iterates through the array to find the minimum length of a sequence of consecutive elements that are the same.
   - It keeps track of the current sequence length (`cnt`) and updates `ans` with the minimum sequence length found.

3. **Output**:
   - If `flag` is `True`, the program outputs `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it outputs the minimum sequence length (`ans`), which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the beautiful property of the array.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Minimum Sequence Length**:
   - The program correctly identifies the minimum sequence length of consecutive elements that are the same. However, it does not correctly account for the scenario where the minimum sequence length might not be sufficient to make the array non-beautiful.
   - For example, in the case of the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the minimum sequence length is `3`, but removing only `3` elements might not necessarily make the array non-beautiful. The program should consider the possibility of removing elements from different sequences to ensure the array is no longer beautiful.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if the array has multiple sequences of the same minimum length, the program might not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove.

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It only considers the minimum sequence length of consecutive elements that are the same, which is not sufficient to solve the problem accurately.

**Correctness: False**
