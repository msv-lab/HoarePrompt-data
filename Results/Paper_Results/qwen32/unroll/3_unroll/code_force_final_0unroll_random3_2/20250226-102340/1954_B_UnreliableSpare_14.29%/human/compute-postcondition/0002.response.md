Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `flag` is True.**

In this output state, the variable `flag` has been set to `True`, while all other variables retain their initial values and constraints.
