Let's analyze the given program step by step and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Beautiful Array Definition**: An array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly using the operation: choose an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) such that `a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1}` and replace `a_i` with `a_{i - 1}`.
2. **Objective**: For each test case, determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. If it's impossible to do so, output `-1`.

### Analysis of the Given Program:
1. **Input Handling**:
    - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Check if All Elements are the Same**:
    - The program initializes a flag `flag` to `True`.
    - It iterates through the array to check if all elements are the same. If any two consecutive elements are different, it sets `flag` to `False` and breaks the loop.

3. **Calculate Minimum Removals**:
    - The program initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')`.
    - It then iterates through the array, counting the length of contiguous segments of the same value.
    - When it encounters a different value, it updates `ans` with the minimum of its current value and the count of the previous segment.
    - After the loop, it performs a final update of `ans` with the count of the last segment.
    - If all elements were the same (`flag` is `True`), it outputs `-1`.
    - Otherwise, it outputs the minimum count stored in `ans`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Removals**:
    - The program only considers the length of contiguous segments of the same value and tries to remove the shortest segment. However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting array will stop being beautiful.
    - For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 3, 1]`. The shortest segment is of length 1 (either the `2` or the `3`). Removing either of these does not make the array stop being beautiful because you can still apply the operation to make all elements `1`.

2. **Logic Flaw**:
    - The logic of counting the shortest segment and removing it is flawed because it does not account for the possibility that removing elements from the middle of the array might not disrupt the beautiful property.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
