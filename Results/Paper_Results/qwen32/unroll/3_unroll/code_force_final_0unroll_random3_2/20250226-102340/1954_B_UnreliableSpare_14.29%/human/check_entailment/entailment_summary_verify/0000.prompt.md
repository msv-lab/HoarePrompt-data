You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
import copy, math, random, decimal
from decimal import Decimal

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    (val, cnt) = (arr[0], 0)
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It checks if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it finds and prints the minimum length of any contiguous subarray within `arr` where all elements are the same.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. Let's analyze the code and provide a counterexample.

### Issues in the Code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `ans`:**
   - The variable `ans` is intended to store the minimum length of a contiguous segment of identical elements. However, the current implementation does not correctly identify and handle all such segments.
   - The code initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` and updates it with the length of segments of identical elements. However, it fails to correctly identify when a segment ends and a new one begins.

2. **Handling of Identical Elements:**
   - The code checks if all elements are identical at the beginning and returns `-1` if they are. This part is correct.
   - However, the logic for calculating the minimum segment length is flawed. The code does not correctly identify all segments of identical elements and does not handle cases where multiple segments of different lengths coexist.

### Counterexample:

Let's consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
7
1 2 2 1 2 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- The array `[1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1]` is beautiful.
- To make it stop being beautiful, we can remove two elements, for example, the two middle `2`s, resulting in `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, which is not beautiful.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
1
```

The program incorrectly outputs `1` for this case, indicating that it does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly handle cases where multiple segments of identical elements exist and does not accurately determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
