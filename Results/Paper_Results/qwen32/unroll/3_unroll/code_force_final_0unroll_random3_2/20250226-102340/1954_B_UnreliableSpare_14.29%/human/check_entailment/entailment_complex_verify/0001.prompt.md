You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: Since the loop only modifies the `flag` variable, and the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `arr` are not affected by the loop, the output state will be:
    #
    #- `t` remains the same.
    #- `n` remains the same.
    #- `a` remains the same.
    #- `arr` remains the same.
    #- `flag` will be `True` if all elements in `arr` are the same; otherwise, `flag` will be `False`.
    #
    #Output State:
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
    #State: - `ans` will be the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `val` before a different element is encountered, or `Decimal('Infinity')` if all elements are equal to `val`.
    #- `val` remains `arr[0]`.
    #- `cnt` will be the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `val`.
    #
    #However, without the specific array `arr` and the value of `n`, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `ans` and `cnt`. Therefore, the most accurate output state we can specify based on the given information is:
    #
    #Output State:
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum of its previous value and cnt)
    #State: `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`; `val` remains `arr[0]`; `cnt` remains unchanged; `flag` is either `True` or `False` depending on the condition evaluated.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It checks if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it finds and prints the minimum length of any contiguous subarray within `arr` where all elements are the same.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Beautiful Array Definition**: An array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly using the operation: choose an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) such that `a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1}` and replace `a_i` with `a_{i - 1}`.
2. **Objective**: For each test case, determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. If it's impossible to do so, output `-1`.

### Analysis of the Given Program:
1. **Input Handling**:
    - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Check if All Elements are the Same**:
    - The program initializes a flag `flag` to `True`.
    - It iterates through the array to check if all elements are the same. If any two consecutive elements are different, it sets `flag` to `False` and breaks the loop.

3. **Calculate Minimum Removals**:
    - The program initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')`.
    - It then iterates through the array, counting the length of contiguous segments of the same value.
    - When it encounters a different value, it updates `ans` with the minimum of its current value and the count of the previous segment.
    - After the loop, it performs a final update of `ans` with the count of the last segment.
    - If all elements were the same (`flag` is `True`), it outputs `-1`.
    - Otherwise, it outputs the minimum count stored in `ans`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Removals**:
    - The program only considers the length of contiguous segments of the same value and tries to remove the shortest segment. However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting array will stop being beautiful.
    - For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 3, 1]`. The shortest segment is of length 1 (either the `2` or the `3`). Removing either of these does not make the array stop being beautiful because you can still apply the operation to make all elements `1`.

2. **Logic Flaw**:
    - The logic of counting the shortest segment and removing it is flawed because it does not account for the possibility that removing elements from the middle of the array might not disrupt the beautiful property.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
