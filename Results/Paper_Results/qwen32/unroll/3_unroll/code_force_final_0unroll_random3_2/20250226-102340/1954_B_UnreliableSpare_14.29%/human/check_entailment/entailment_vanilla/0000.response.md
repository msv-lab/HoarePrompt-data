### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful.
   - An array is beautiful if we can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If the array is already uniform (all elements are the same), it is impossible to make it non-beautiful, so the answer should be `-1`.
   - Otherwise, we need to find the smallest contiguous segment of the same elements that can be removed to break the beauty condition.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program first checks if the entire array is uniform by iterating through the array and checking if all elements are the same.
   - If the array is uniform, it correctly returns `-1`.
   - If the array is not uniform, it tries to find the smallest segment of contiguous elements that can be removed to break the beauty condition. It does this by counting the length of segments of the same elements and keeping track of the smallest segment length.
   - However, the current implementation has a flaw. It only considers segments that end at the last element of the array, which is not sufficient to find the smallest removable segment that breaks the beauty condition.

4. **Flaw in the Implementation:**
   - The current implementation does not correctly find the smallest removable segment that breaks the beauty condition. It only considers segments ending at the last element, which is insufficient. For example, in the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the smallest removable segment that breaks the beauty condition is `[3, 3, 3]` at the beginning or end, but the program might not correctly identify this.

### Correctness:

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the smallest removable segment that breaks the beauty condition. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
