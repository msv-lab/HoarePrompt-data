The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `t` is given as an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, which already ensures that the loop will execute.

Since the loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need an initial state set, we only need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000**
