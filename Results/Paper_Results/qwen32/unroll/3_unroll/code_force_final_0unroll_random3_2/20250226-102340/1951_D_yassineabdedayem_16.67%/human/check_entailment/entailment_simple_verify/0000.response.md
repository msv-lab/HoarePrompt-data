### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires setting up stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Alice buys greedily, meaning she will buy as many jewels as possible from the first stall, then move to the next stall, and so on. The goal is to set up at most 60 stalls with prices between 1 and \(10^{18}\) coins per jewel.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve this problem by iteratively setting prices for stalls based on the minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k`. However, the logic for determining these prices is flawed and does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.

##### Key Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Price Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `Min` and `Max` as `min(n // k, k)` and `max(int(n / k), k)`, respectively.
   - It then decides the price based on whether `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`. This logic does not ensure that the total number of jewels bought equals `k`.

2. **Incorrect Update of `k` and `n`**:
   - The program updates `k` by subtracting either `Max` or `Min`, and `n` by subtracting `Min * Max`. These updates do not correctly reflect the number of jewels bought and the remaining coins.

3. **Insufficient Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the number of stalls exceeds 60 or where the prices do not result in exactly `k` jewels being bought.

#### Example Analysis:
Let's consider the test case `7 3`:

- **Program Output**:
  - The program might output:
    ```
    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    ```
  - This is incorrect because Alice would buy 3 jewels at 2 coins each, leaving her with 1 coin, which is not enough to buy any more jewels. Thus, she buys only 3 jewels, but the prices do not reflect a valid setup.

- **Correct Output**:
  - A correct output could be:
    ```
    YES
    1
    2
    ```
  - Here, Alice buys 3 jewels at 2 coins each, totaling 6 coins spent and exactly 3 jewels bought.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly determine the prices for the stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The logic for setting prices and updating the number of jewels and coins is flawed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
