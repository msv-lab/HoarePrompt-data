To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's analyze the given code:

The loop iterates from `1` to the square root of `x` (inclusive). During each iteration, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `x`. If it is, both `i` and `x // i` are appended to `output1` and `output2`, respectively.

This process effectively finds all the divisors of `x` and stores them in `output1` and `output2`. The divisors are paired such that for each `i` in `output1`, `x // i` in `output2` is the corresponding complementary divisor.

After the loop completes, `output1` will contain all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output2` will contain the corresponding complementary divisors that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`.

**Output State:** `x` and `n` remain unchanged as integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9; `output1` is a list containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`; `output2` is a list containing the corresponding complementary divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`.
