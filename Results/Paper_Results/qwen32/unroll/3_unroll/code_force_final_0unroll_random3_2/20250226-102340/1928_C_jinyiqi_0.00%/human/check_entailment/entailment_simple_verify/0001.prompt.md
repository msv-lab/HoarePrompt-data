You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the number of valid `k` values for which a given position `n` in a line corresponds to a certain number `x` after the "first-k-th" positioning process. The positioning process follows a pattern that repeats every `2k - 2` positions.

### Key Points

1. **Pattern Understanding**:
   - The sequence of numbers is `1, 2, ..., k, k-1, ..., 2` and repeats.
   - This sequence has a cycle length of `2k - 2`.
   - The position `n` in the line corresponds to a number `x` in this sequence.

2. **Condition for Valid `k`**:
   - For a given `n` and `x`, we need to find `k` such that the position `n` in the line corresponds to `x` in the sequence.
   - This involves finding `k` such that `(n - 1) % (2k - 2) + 1` equals `x` or `(2k - 2) - ((n - 1) % (2k - 2)) + 1` equals `x`.

3. **Mathematical Formulation**:
   - The condition can be formulated as `(n - 1) % (2k - 2) + 1 == x` or `(2k - 2) - ((n - 1) % (2k - 2)) + 1 == x`.
   - Simplifying, we get `(n - 1) % (2k - 2) == x - 1` or `(2k - 2) - ((n - 1) % (2k - 2)) == x - 1`.
   - This leads to two equations:
     1. `(n - 1) % (2k - 2) == x - 1`
     2. `(n - 1) % (2k - 2) == 2k - x - 1`

4. **Finding Valid `k`**:
   - From the equations, we can derive that `(n - x) % (2k - 2) == 0` or `(n + x - 2) % (2k - 2) == 0`.
   - This means `2k - 2` must be a divisor of `n - x` or `n + x - 2`.
   - We need to find all divisors of `n - x` and `n + x - 2` and check if they satisfy the conditions for `k`.

### Program Analysis

1. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calculates the divisors of `n - x` and `n + x - 2`.
   - It then checks if these divisors can be used to find valid `k` values.

2. **Issues in the Program**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return the divisors of a number, but it returns the divisors in a reversed order of their pairs, which is unnecessary.
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to find valid `k` values from the divisors.
   - The program does not print the results for each test case.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to find valid `k` values.
   - It does not correctly handle the conditions for valid `k`.
   - It does not print the results for each test case.

### Conclusion

Given the issues in the program, it is incorrect. The program does not correctly find the number of valid `k` values for each test case.

Correctness: **False**
