Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the number of valid `k` values for which a given position `n` in a line corresponds to a certain number `x` after the "first-k-th" positioning process. The positioning process follows a pattern that repeats every `2k - 2` positions.

### Key Points

1. **Pattern Understanding**:
   - The sequence of numbers is `1, 2, ..., k, k-1, ..., 2` and repeats.
   - This sequence has a cycle length of `2k - 2`.
   - The position `n` in the line corresponds to a number `x` in this sequence.

2. **Condition for Valid `k`**:
   - For a given `n` and `x`, we need to find `k` such that the position `n` in the line corresponds to `x` in the sequence.
   - This involves finding `k` such that `(n - 1) % (2k - 2) + 1` equals `x` or `(2k - 2) - ((n - 1) % (2k - 2)) + 1` equals `x`.

3. **Mathematical Formulation**:
   - The condition can be formulated as `(n - 1) % (2k - 2) + 1 == x` or `(2k - 2) - ((n - 1) % (2k - 2)) + 1 == x`.
   - Simplifying, we get `(n - 1) % (2k - 2) == x - 1` or `(2k - 2) - ((n - 1) % (2k - 2)) == x - 1`.
   - This leads to two equations:
     1. `(n - 1) % (2k - 2) == x - 1`
     2. `(n - 1) % (2k - 2) == 2k - x - 1`

4. **Finding Valid `k`**:
   - From the equations, we can derive that `(n - x) % (2k - 2) == 0` or `(n + x - 2) % (2k - 2) == 0`.
   - This means `2k - 2` must be a divisor of `n - x` or `n + x - 2`.
   - We need to find all divisors of `n - x` and `n + x - 2` and check if they satisfy the conditions for `k`.

### Program Analysis

1. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calculates the divisors of `n - x` and `n + x - 2`.
   - It then checks if these divisors can be used to find valid `k` values.

2. **Issues in the Program**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return the divisors of a number, but it returns the divisors in a reversed order of their pairs, which is unnecessary.
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to find valid `k` values from the divisors.
   - The program does not print the results for each test case.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to find valid `k` values.
   - It does not correctly handle the conditions for valid `k`.
   - It does not print the results for each test case.

### Conclusion

Given the issues in the program, it is incorrect. The program does not correctly find the number of valid `k` values for each test case.

Correctness: **False**
