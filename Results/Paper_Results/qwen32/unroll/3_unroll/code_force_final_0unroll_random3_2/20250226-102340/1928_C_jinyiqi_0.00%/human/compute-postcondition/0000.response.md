Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9; `output1` is an empty list.**

In natural language: The variables `x` and `n` retain their initial integer values with the condition that `x` is less than `n`, both within the range from 1 to 10^9. The new variable `output1` is initialized as an empty list.
