To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_3()` returns. However, since `func_3()` is not defined in the given context, we can only infer that `testcases` will be assigned the value returned by `func_3()`.

Since no specific details about `func_3()` are provided, we can only say that `testcases` will hold whatever value `func_3()` returns, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`testcases` holds the value returned by `func_3()`.**
