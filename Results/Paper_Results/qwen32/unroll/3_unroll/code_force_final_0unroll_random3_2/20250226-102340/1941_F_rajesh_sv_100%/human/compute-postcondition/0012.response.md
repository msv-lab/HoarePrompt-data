Functionality: **The function accepts three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `2 <= n <= 10^5`, `1 <= m, k <= 2 * 10^5`. It also accepts a list `A` of `n` integers representing the complexities of the prepared problems, sorted in strictly ascending order, a sorted list `D` of `m` unique integers representing the complexities of the models, and a list `F` of `k` integers representing the complexities of the functions. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return conditions and values are not provided in the given information.**
