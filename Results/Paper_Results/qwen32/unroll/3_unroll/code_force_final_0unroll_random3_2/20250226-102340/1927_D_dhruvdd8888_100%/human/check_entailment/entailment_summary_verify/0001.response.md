Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem based on the provided problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to process multiple test cases, where each test case includes an array and a series of queries. Each query specifies a subarray, and for each subarray, we need to find two distinct elements or report that no such pair exists.

### Program Analysis
The program reads the input and processes each test case by calling `func_1`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `tc` is read.
   - For each test case, the length of the array `N`, the array elements `nums`, and the number of queries `q` are read.

2. **Preprocessing the Array:**
   - The program creates a list `arr` that contains tuples representing segments of the array where the elements are the same. Each tuple contains the start index, end index, and the value of the segment.
   - This is done by iterating through the array and recording the segments where consecutive elements are equal.

3. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment that starts within the query range `[l, r]`.
   - It then checks the conditions to determine if a pair of distinct elements exists within the query range:
     - If the segment starts after `l`, it checks if the previous element can form a pair with the first element of the current segment.
     - If the segment ends before `r`, it checks if the next element can form a pair with the last element of the current segment.
     - If no such pair is found, it outputs `-1 -1`.

### Issues in the Program
Let's delve deeper into the logic and correctness of the program.

1. **Incorrect Handling of Query Ranges:**
   - The program uses `bisect_left` to find the segment that starts within the query range `[l, r]`. However, it does not correctly handle cases where multiple segments exist within the range `[l, r]`.
   - The logic for checking the segments and forming pairs is flawed. Specifically, it does not correctly identify when a pair of distinct elements exists within the query range.
   - For example, if the query range contains multiple segments with different values, the program should be able to find a pair of distinct elements.

2. **Incorrect Use of Binary Search:**
   - The binary search is used to find the segment that starts within the query range, but the logic to determine the pair is incorrect.
   - The program does not correctly check if there are distinct elements within the query range by examining the segments.
   - For instance, if the segment found by `bisect_left` does not contain distinct elements, the program should look for other segments within the query range.

3. **Incorrect Output for Edge Cases:**
   - The program may output incorrect results for certain edge cases, such as when all elements in the query range are the same.
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where the segment starts before `l` or ends after `r`.

### Correctness
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion
Reasoning: The program has incorrect logic for handling query ranges and determining pairs of distinct elements. It does not correctly use binary search to find the appropriate segments and does not handle edge cases properly.

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
