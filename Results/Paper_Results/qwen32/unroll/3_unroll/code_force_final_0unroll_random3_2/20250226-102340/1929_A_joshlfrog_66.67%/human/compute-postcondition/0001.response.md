The only variable in the loop head is `e` and the range it iterates over is `t`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of `t` to be at least 1. The variables `n` and the list `a` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.**
