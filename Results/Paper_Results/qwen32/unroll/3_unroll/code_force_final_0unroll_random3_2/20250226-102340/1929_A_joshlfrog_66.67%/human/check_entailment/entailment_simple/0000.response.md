### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to calculate the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i - 1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \(n\) and a list of \(n\) integers. It then calculates the maximum and minimum values in the list for each test case and outputs the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

However, this approach is incorrect for the problem at hand. The maximum beauty of the array is not simply the difference between the maximum and minimum values. Instead, the maximum beauty is achieved by arranging the array in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This can be achieved by sorting the array in either ascending or descending order.

For example, consider the array \([100, 54, 80, 43, 90]\). The maximum beauty is achieved by sorting the array in descending order, resulting in \([100, 90, 80, 54, 43]\). The beauty of this array is \((90 - 100) + (80 - 90) + (54 - 80) + (43 - 54) = -10 - 10 - 26 - 11 = -57\), but since we are looking for the absolute maximum beauty, we should consider the absolute differences, which would be \(10 + 10 + 26 + 11 = 57\).

The provided program does not sort the array and instead calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which does not maximize the beauty of the array.
