To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's break down what the loop does:

1. **Loop Iteration (`for e in range(t)`):** The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. **Input Reading:**
   - `l` is the number of integers in the current test case.
   - `nums` is a list of `l` integers.
3. **Variable Initialization:**
   - `x` is initialized to 0. This variable will track the maximum value in the list.
   - `y` is initialized to 100,000,000. This variable will track the minimum value in the list.
4. **Inner Loop (`for i in range(l)`):**
   - For each integer in `nums`, the loop updates `x` to the maximum value found so far.
   - It also updates `y` to the minimum value found so far.
5. **Output:**
   - After processing all integers in the current test case, the difference between the maximum (`x`) and minimum (`y`) values is printed.

**Output State Description:**
After all iterations of the outer loop have completed, the variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The variables `x` and `y` are local to each iteration and do not persist across iterations. The only observable output is the series of printed differences between the maximum and minimum values for each test case.

Since the problem asks for the output state in terms of the variables provided in the initial state, and considering that the loop does not alter `t`, `n`, or `a`, and only prints values, the output state in terms of these variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **t is an input integer, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.**
