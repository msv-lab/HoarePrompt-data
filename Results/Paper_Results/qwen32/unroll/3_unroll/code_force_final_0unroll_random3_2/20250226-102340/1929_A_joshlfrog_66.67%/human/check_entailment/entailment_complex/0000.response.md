Reasoning:  
The program is designed to find the maximum beauty of an array, which is calculated as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. The key to maximizing this sum is to arrange the array in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

However, the provided program does not sort the array. Instead, it finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints their difference. This approach does not necessarily yield the maximum beauty of the array. 

For example, consider the test case with the array [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]. The maximum beauty can be achieved by arranging the array as [43, 54, 80, 90, 100], which gives a beauty of (54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57. However, the provided program will output 100 - 43 = 57, which coincidentally matches the correct answer for this particular test case but does not guarantee the correct answer for all cases.

The correct approach would be to sort the array and then compute the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. Therefore, the provided program is not correct in general.

Correctness: **False**
