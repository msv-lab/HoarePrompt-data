The code snippet `output1.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the list `output1`. The other variables `x`, `n`, `output2` remain unchanged.

Since `output1` originally contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, after reversing, the order of these divisors is simply flipped. The precondition that `x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `output2` contains the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`, in descending order, still holds.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `output1` is a list containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, in reversed order; `output2` is a list containing the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`, in descending order.**
