You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n - x)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)

    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:

    output = list(set(output))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and n are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
        
    #State: `x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `output1` is a list containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`; `output2` is a list containing the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`, in descending order.
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1
    #The program returns a list that first contains all divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x` in descending order, followed by all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reversed order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a list of all divisors of `x`, first listing those that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x` in descending order, followed by those that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in ascending order.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description. Here are the main problems:

1. **Undefined Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is called within the main loop but is not defined anywhere in the given code. This will cause a `NameError` when the program is executed.

2. **Incomplete Output Handling**: The program calculates potential values of `k` and stores them in the `output` list, but it does not print the length of this list for each test case, which is required by the problem description.

3. **Incorrect Calculation Logic**: The logic for calculating `k` values seems incorrect. The conditions and calculations used do not match the problem description's requirements for determining valid `k` values.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if `x` is 1 or `x` is `n-1`, the logic might not work as expected.

To make the program correct, we need to:

- Define the `func_1` function properly.
- Ensure that the program prints the number of valid `k` values for each test case.
- Correct the logic for calculating valid `k` values based on the problem description.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def count_valid_k(n, x):
    count = 0
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        period = 2 * k - 2
        position_in_period = (n - 1) % period
        if position_in_period < k - 1:
            if position_in_period + 1 == x:
                count += 1
        else:
            if (2 * k - 2 - position_in_period) == x:
                count += 1
    return count

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_k(n, x))
```

This corrected version defines a function `count_valid_k` that calculates the number of valid `k` values for given `n` and `x`. It then iterates through each test case, calculates the result, and prints it. The logic correctly handles the periodic nature of the settling process and checks if the given position `n` corresponds to the number `x` for each possible `k`.
