The code snippet provided initializes a new empty list named `output2`. The variables `x` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet. The `output1` list is also not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `output1` is an empty list; `output2` is an empty list.**
