### Reasoning:

The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic for the problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic used in the program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Path Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the path and score for Bodya:
     - It starts from `P_B`, adds the value of `a` at that position to the path, and moves to the position indicated by `p`.
     - This continues until a cycle is detected (i.e., a previously visited position is encountered).
   - The same process is repeated for Sasha, starting from `P_S`.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - For each player, the program calculates the maximum possible score they can achieve in `k` turns.
   - It iterates over the path and calculates the score for each possible number of turns up to `k`.
   - The score is calculated by summing the values of `a` along the path, considering the number of turns left after each step.

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - The program compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, and "Draw" if their scores are equal.

### Correctness:

The program follows the problem description accurately and handles the input and output correctly. It calculates the paths and scores for both players and compares them to determine the winner. The logic for detecting cycles and calculating scores is consistent with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:

Based on the provided reasoning and the structure of the program, it appears to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
