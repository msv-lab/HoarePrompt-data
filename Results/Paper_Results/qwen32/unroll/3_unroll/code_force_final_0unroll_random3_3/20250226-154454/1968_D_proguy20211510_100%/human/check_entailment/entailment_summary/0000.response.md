### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by simulating the game for both Bodya and Sasha. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and its correctness:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` (the length of the permutation, the number of turns, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively).
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Path Calculation:**
   - For both Bodya and Sasha, the program calculates their paths by following the permutation `p` starting from their respective starting positions `P_B` and `P_S`.
   - It uses a `vis` (visited) array to detect cycles in the permutation to avoid infinite loops.
   - The scores for each player are accumulated in `pathb` and `paths` lists.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the maximum possible score for each player by iterating over their paths.
   - For each step `i` in the path, it computes the score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining `k-i` turns.
   - It keeps track of the best score for each player in `resb` and `ress`.

4. **Result Output:**
   - After calculating the scores for both players, the program compares them and prints the winner or "Draw" if the scores are equal.

### Evaluation:

- **Cycle Detection:** The use of a `vis` array to detect cycles ensures that the program does not get stuck in infinite loops.
- **Score Calculation:** The logic for calculating the maximum score by staying at the current position for the remaining turns is correct.
- **Comparison:** The final comparison of scores to determine the winner is straightforward and correct.

The program appears to correctly implement the described logic and handles all the necessary aspects of the problem, including cycle detection and score calculation.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
