The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. Specifically, the loop will execute `t` times if `t` is greater than or equal to 1. Given the condition `1 ≤ t ≤ 50`, the loop will definitely execute at least once.

Since the loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be initialized before the loop starts, the only state we need to ensure is that `t` is within the specified range.

State: **`t` is an integer provided by the input, and 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 50**
