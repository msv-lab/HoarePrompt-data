You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` consisting of the repetition of '110' `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, it prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to generate a string of uppercase Latin letters.
- The string must contain exactly `n` special characters.
- A character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
3. If `n` is odd, the program outputs "NO" because it claims that there can't be an odd number of special characters.
4. If `n` is even, the program constructs a string `s` using the pattern '110' repeated `n // 2` times.
5. It then checks if the length of `s` is less than 200. If it is, it outputs "YES" and the constructed string `s`. Otherwise, it outputs "NO".

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Character Set**: The program constructs the string using the characters '1', '1', and '0', which are not uppercase Latin letters as required by the problem statement.
2. **Special Characters Misinterpretation**: The program incorrectly assumes that special characters can only be formed using the pattern '110'. This pattern does not necessarily create special characters in the context of uppercase Latin letters.
3. **Odd `n` Handling**: The program correctly identifies that an odd number of special characters cannot be formed with the given pattern. However, this is not a universal rule for all possible strings. For example, the string "AAABAA" has 3 special characters, which is odd.
4. **String Construction**: The constructed string '110' does not meet the criteria of having special characters as defined in the problem statement.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to construct a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly `n` special characters. One way to do this is to use a pattern like "ABA" which has 2 special characters. We can repeat this pattern to achieve the desired number of special characters.

### Correct Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 0:
            print('YES')
            print('A')
        elif n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            # Construct a string with exactly n special characters
            # Using pattern "ABA" which has 2 special characters
            s = 'ABA' * (n // 2)
            print('YES')
            print(s)

# Example usage
# func()
```

Given the issues with the provided program, the correctness of the given program is:
