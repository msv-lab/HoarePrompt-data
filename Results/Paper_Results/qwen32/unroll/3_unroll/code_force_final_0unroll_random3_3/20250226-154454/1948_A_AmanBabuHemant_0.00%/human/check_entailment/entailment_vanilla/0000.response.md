Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires constructing a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly `n` special characters. A character is considered special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

### Key Observations
1. **Special Character Definition**: 
   - If a character is special, it must be different from one of its neighbors and the same as the other. This implies that special characters will always appear in pairs, except possibly at the edges of the string.

2. **Parity of `n`**:
   - If `n` is odd, it is impossible to have exactly `n` special characters because special characters always come in pairs. Therefore, the program should print `NO` for odd `n`.
   - If `n` is even, it is possible to construct such a string. For example, for `n=2`, a string like "AA" or "BB" can be used, where both characters are special.

3. **String Construction**:
   - For even `n`, the program should construct a string that has exactly `n` special characters. The provided example string "AAABAACC" has 6 special characters, which is even.

### Program Analysis
Let's examine the provided program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
```

1. **Handling Odd `n`**:
   - The program correctly checks if `n` is odd (`n % 2`). If it is, it prints `NO`, which is correct as per the problem statement.

2. **Handling Even `n`**:
   - For even `n`, the program constructs a string `s` using the pattern `'110' * (n // 2)`. This string will have a length of `3 * (n // 2)`.
   - The program then checks if the length of `s` is less than 200. Since `n` is at most 50, the maximum length of `s` will be `3 * (50 // 2) = 75`, which is well within the 200-character limit.

3. **Special Characters in Constructed String**:
   - The pattern `'110'` has two special characters: the first and the second characters. Therefore, the constructed string `s` will have `2 * (n // 2) = n` special characters, which is exactly what we need.

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles both cases (odd and even `n`) and constructs a valid string for even `n` that meets the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
