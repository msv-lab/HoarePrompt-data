The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop will execute if `i` starts at `n - 3` and decrements down to `-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least `3` so that `n - 3` is a non-negative integer.

Given the provided state, `n` is assigned the value of the first integer inputted, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` initialized to 0, except for specific indices. However, the state of `dp` does not affect the execution of the loop, and `cards` is also not directly involved in the loop's execution condition.

Thus, to ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least `3`.

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers representing the integers on the cards in your hand, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` with all elements initialized to 0, except `dp[n - 1][0]` is 0 and `dp[n - 2][0]` is 0**
