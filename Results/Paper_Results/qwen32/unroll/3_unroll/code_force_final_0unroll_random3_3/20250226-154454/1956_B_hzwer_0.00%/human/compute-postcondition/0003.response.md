The code assigns the value `0` to the element at the position `[n - 1][0]` in the `dp` 2D list. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of the first integer inputted; `cards` is a list of integers representing the integers on the cards in your hand; `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` with all elements initialized to 0, except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is 0.**
