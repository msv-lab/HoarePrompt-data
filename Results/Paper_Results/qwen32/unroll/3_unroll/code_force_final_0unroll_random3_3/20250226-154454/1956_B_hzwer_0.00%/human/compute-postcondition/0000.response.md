Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of cards each player receives. The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`) representing the integers on the cards in your hand. Each integer from 1 through `n` appears in the sequence `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` at most 2 times. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `n` is assigned the value of the first integer inputted.**

In simpler terms: The value of `n` is now the first integer inputted, which represents the number of cards each player receives. All other conditions and variables remain the same.
