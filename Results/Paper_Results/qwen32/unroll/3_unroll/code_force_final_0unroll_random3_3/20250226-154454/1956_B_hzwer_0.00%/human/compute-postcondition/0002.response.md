The code snippet creates a 2D list `dp` with dimensions `(n+1) x (n+1)`, where each element is initialized to 0. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of the first integer inputted; `cards` is a list of integers representing the integers on the cards in your hand; `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` with all elements initialized to 0.**
