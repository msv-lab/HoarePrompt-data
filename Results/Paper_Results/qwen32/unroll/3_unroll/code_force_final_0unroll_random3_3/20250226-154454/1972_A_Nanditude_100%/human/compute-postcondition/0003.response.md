Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it receives an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of problems, followed by two lists `a` and `b`, each of length `n`. The elements of `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ a_{i+1} ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ b_{i+1} ≤ 10^9. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the provided lists `a` and `b`.**
