You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A contest contains n problems and the difficulty of the i -th problem is
expected to be at most b_i . There are already n problem proposals and the
difficulty of the i -th problem is a_i . Initially, both a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
and b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Some of the problems may be more difficult than expected, so the writers must
propose more problems. When a new problem with difficulty w is proposed, the
most difficult problem will be deleted from the contest, and the problems will
be sorted in a way that the difficulties are non-decreasing.

In other words, in each operation, you choose an integer w , insert it into
the array a , sort array a in non-decreasing order, and remove the last
element from it.

Find the minimum number of new problems to make a_i\le b_i for all i .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of problems.

The second line of each test case contains an array a of length n (1\le a_1\le
a_2\le\cdots\le a_n\le 10^9 ).

The third line of each test case contains an array b of length n (1\le b_1\le
b_2\le\cdots\le b_n\le 10^9 ).

Output

For each test case, print an integer as your answer in a new line.

    4 5 6 7 8 9

Note

In the first test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

In the second test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1 and a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=2 and a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=3 and a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of problems, followed by two lists a and b, each of length n. The elements of a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ a_{i+1} ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ b_{i+1} ≤ 10^9. The function will be called multiple times with different test cases, the number of which is given by the first input t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = 0
        
        i = 0
        
        for j in range(n):
            if b[j] < a[i]:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: t is 0, n, a, b, cnt, and i are in the state they were in after the last test case was processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two sorted lists of integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it counts and prints the number of elements in `b` that are less than the smallest unmatched element in `a`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the sorted lists of expected difficulties (`b`) and actual difficulties (`a`). It uses a two-pointer technique to determine the minimum number of new problems required.

However, there is a flaw in the logic. The program does not actually simulate the process of inserting new problems and removing the most difficult one. Instead, it simply counts the number of times an element in `b` is less than the current element in `a` that it is comparing against. This does not correctly simulate the problem's requirement of always removing the most difficult problem after inserting a new one.

For example, in the first test case:
- The program compares `b[0]` (800) with `a[0]` (1000) and increments the count because `800 < 1000`.
- Then it compares `b[1]` (1200) with `a[1]` (1400) and increments the count again because `1200 < 1400`.
- However, it should actually insert `800` as a new problem, sort the list, and remove the last element (2700), then compare `b[1]` (1200) with the new `a[1]` (1000), and so on.

The program does not perform these steps correctly, leading to incorrect results in many cases.
