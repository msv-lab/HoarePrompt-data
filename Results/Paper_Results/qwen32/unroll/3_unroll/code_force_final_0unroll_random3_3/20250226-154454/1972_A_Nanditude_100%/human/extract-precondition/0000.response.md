Precondition: **Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of problems, followed by two lists a and b, each of length n. The elements of a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ a_{i+1} ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ b_{i+1} ≤ 10^9. The function will be called multiple times with different test cases, the number of which is given by the first input t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).**
