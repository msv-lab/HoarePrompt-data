The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The underscore `_` is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, and `t` must be greater than 0**
