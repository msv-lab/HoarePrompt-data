The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `results`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` is within the range 2 to 1000. The only change made by the code is the creation of the `results` list, which is initially empty.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `results` is an empty list.**
