Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^3.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is now the integer input by the user, which is within the range of 1 to 50. The precondition regarding `n` for each of the `t` test cases remains unchanged.
