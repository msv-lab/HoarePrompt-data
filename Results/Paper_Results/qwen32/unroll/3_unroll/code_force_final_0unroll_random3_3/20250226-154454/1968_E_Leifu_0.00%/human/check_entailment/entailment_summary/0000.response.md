Let's analyze the program and the problem requirements to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Objective**: Maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between pairs of cells.
2. **Input**: An integer \(t\) (number of test cases) followed by \(t\) integers \(n\) (grid size for each test case).
3. **Output**: For each test case, output \(n\) pairs of coordinates \((x_i, y_i)\) such that the number of distinct Manhattan distances is maximized.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows a specific pattern for generating the points:
- For \(n = 2\), it outputs: `1 1` and `1 2`.
- For \(n = 3\), it outputs: `1 1`, `1 2`, and `2 3`.
- For \(n > 3\), it outputs: `1 1`, `1 2`, `2 4`, and `(j, j)` for each \(j\) from 4 to \(n\).

### Evaluation of the Program:
Let's consider the first few test cases provided in the problem statement to evaluate the program's correctness:

1. **Test Case \(n = 2\)**:
   - Points: `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`
   - Distances: \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
   - Distinct distances: \(\{0, 1\}\)
   - The program correctly outputs the points and achieves the maximum possible distinct distances.

2. **Test Case \(n = 3\)**:
   - Points: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(2, 3)`
   - Distances: \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\), \(|1-1| + |1-3| = 2\), \(|1-2| + |2-3| = 2\), \(|1-2| + |1-3| = 2\), \(|1-2| + |2-3| = 2\), \(|2-2| + |3-3| = 0\)
   - Distinct distances: \(\{0, 1, 2\}\)
   - The program correctly outputs the points and achieves the maximum possible distinct distances.

3. **Test Case \(n > 3\)**:
   - The pattern includes points `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, and `(j, j)` for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\).
   - The inclusion of `(j, j)` points ensures that the Manhattan distance between these points and the other points is unique for each \(j\), thereby increasing the number of distinct distances.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to generate a set of points that maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances for the given \(n\). The strategy of including points along the diagonal for \(j > 3\) helps in achieving this goal.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the program is correct for the provided test cases and the strategy used seems to be effective for the problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
