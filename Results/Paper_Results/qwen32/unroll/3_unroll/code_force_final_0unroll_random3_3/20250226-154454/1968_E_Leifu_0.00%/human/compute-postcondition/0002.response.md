To determine the output state after the loop has completed all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the provided code snippet. The code processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it prints a series of pairs of integers based on the value of `n`.

Here is a breakdown of what happens in each iteration of the outer loop (for each test case):

1. The value of `n` is read from the input.
2. The first two lines printed are always `1 1` and `1 2`.
3. If `n` is 3, the next line printed is `2 3`.
4. If `n` is greater than 3, the next line printed is `2 4`, followed by a series of lines where each line is of the form `j j` for `j` ranging from 4 to `n`.

Since the output is a series of printed statements and not a change in variable states, the output state can be described as the sequence of printed lines for all test cases.

Output State: **For each test case, the output consists of the lines `1 1`, `1 2`. If `n` is 3, it includes `2 3`. If `n` is greater than 3, it includes `2 4` followed by `j j` for `j` from 4 to `n`.**
