### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly maximizes the set of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of `n`.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to choose `n` cells in an `n x n` grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case one by one.
   
2. **Output for Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it starts by printing the points `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`.
   - For `n = 3`, it additionally prints `(2, 3)`.
   - For `n > 3`, it prints `(2, 4)` followed by a series of points `(j, j)` for `j` from `4` to `n`.

#### Evaluation:
Let's check if this strategy ensures that the set of distinct Manhattan distances is maximized.

1. **For `n = 2`:**
   - Points: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`
   - Possible Manhattan distances:
     - Between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: `|1-1| + |1-2| = 1`
   - Distinct distances: `{0, 1}` (Note: `0` is the distance from a point to itself, which is not typically considered in pair-wise distances, but it's included in the problem's example).
   - The program's output is correct for `n = 2`.

2. **For `n = 3`:**
   - Points: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 3)`
   - Possible Manhattan distances:
     - Between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: `1`
     - Between `(1, 1)` and `(2, 3)`: `|1-2| + |1-3| = 3`
     - Between `(1, 2)` and `(2, 3)`: `|1-2| + |2-3| = 2`
   - Distinct distances: `{0, 1, 2, 3}`
   - The program's output is correct for `n = 3`.

3. **For `n > 3`:**
   - Points: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, and `(j, j)` for `j` from `4` to `n`
   - Possible Manhattan distances include:
     - Between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: `1`
     - Between `(1, 1)` and `(2, 4)`: `4`
     - Between `(1, 2)` and `(2, 4)`: `3`
     - Between `(1, 1)` and `(j, j)`: `|1-j| + |1-j| = 2(j-1)`
     - Between `(1, 2)` and `(j, j)`: `|1-j| + |2-j| = 2(j-1) - 1`
     - Between `(2, 4)` and `(j, j)`: `|2-j| + |4-j| = 2(j-3)`
     - Between `(j, j)` and `(k, k)`: `|j-k| + |j-k| = 2|j-k|`
   - This strategy indeed generates a wide range of distinct distances, but let's verify if it covers all possible distances.

#### Verification:
For `n = 4`, the points `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, `(4, 4)` yield the following distinct Manhattan distances:
- Between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: `1`
- Between `(1, 1)` and `(2, 4)`: `4`
- Between `(1, 2)` and `(2, 4)`: `3`
- Between `(1, 1)` and `(4, 4)`: `6`
- Between `(1, 2)` and `(4, 4)`: `5`
- Between `(2, 4)` and `(4, 4)`: `4`
- Between `(4, 4)` and `(4, 4)`: `0` (not typically considered, but included in the problem's example)
- Between `(1, 1)` and `(2, 2)`: `2` (not included in the program's output)
- Between `(1, 2)` and `(3, 3)`: `3` (already included)
- Between `(2, 4)` and `(3, 3)`: `2` (not included in the program's output)

The program's output for `n = 4` does not include all possible distinct distances, and it misses out on some distances that could be achieved by a different arrangement of points.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not guarantee to maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances for all `n`. For instance, for `n = 4`, the points `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, `(4, 4)` do not yield the maximum possible distinct distances. A better strategy would be to place points in a way that maximizes the variety of distances, such as placing points on a diagonal with some offset.
