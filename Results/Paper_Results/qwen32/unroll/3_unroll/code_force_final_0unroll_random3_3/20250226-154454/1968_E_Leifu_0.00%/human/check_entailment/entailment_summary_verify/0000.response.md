Let's analyze the problem and the provided program in detail using the function summary and the original assessment.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances for a given \( n \times n \) grid by choosing \( n \) cells. The Manhattan distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is \( |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \).

### Program Analysis

The provided program handles different cases as follows:

1. **For \( n = 2 \)**:
   - Outputs: (1,1) and (1,2)
   - Distances: {0, 1}
   - This is correct.

2. **For \( n = 3 \)**:
   - Outputs: (1,1), (1,2), and (2,3)
   - Distances: {0, 1, 2, 3}
   - This is correct.

3. **For \( n \geq 4 \)**:
   - Outputs: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), and (j,j) for \( j \) from 4 to \( n \)
   - The distances generated by this arrangement are limited and do not cover all possible distinct Manhattan distances.

### Function Summary
The function summary correctly describes the program's behavior for each test case.

### Original Assessment
The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not handle the cases for \( n \geq 4 \) optimally. For larger values of \( n \), the program does not generate a set of points that maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances.

### Detailed Reasoning

Let's consider the example given in the original assessment for \( n = 4 \):

- **Program Output**: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4)
- **Manhattan Distances**: {0, 1, 3, 6}

A better arrangement could be:

- **Better Output**: (1,1), (1,4), (4,1), (4,4)
- **Manhattan Distances**: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}

This arrangement clearly maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances for \( n \geq 4 \).

**Final: False**
