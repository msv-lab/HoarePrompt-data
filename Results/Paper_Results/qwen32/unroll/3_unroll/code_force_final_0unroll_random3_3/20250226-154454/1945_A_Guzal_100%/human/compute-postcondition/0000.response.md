The code snippet provided only reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Therefore, the value of `n` will be the integer provided by the input, and no other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each of the t test cases, a, b, and c are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; n is the input integer.**
