The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. The variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to affect the execution of the loop. 

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0. The state of `i` does not need to be explicitly set before the loop starts because `i` will be initialized by the `range(n)` function.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each of the t test cases, a, b, and c are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `n` must be greater than 0**
