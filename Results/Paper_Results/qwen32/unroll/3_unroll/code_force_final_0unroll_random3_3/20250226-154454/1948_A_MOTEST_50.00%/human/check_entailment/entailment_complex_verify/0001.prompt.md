You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, there is an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 50.

    #State: - After all iterations, the variables `t` and `s` remain unchanged.
    #   - The variable `i` will be equal to `t` after the loop ends, as it increments from 0 to `t-1`.
    #   - The variables `n`, `ans`, and `x` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop.
    #
    #Since the problem asks for the output state after all executions of the loop and not the printed output, we focus on the state of the variables:
    #
    #- `t` remains the same.
    #- `s` remains the same.
    #- `i` will be equal to `t` after the loop ends.
    #- `n`, `ans`, and `x` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop.
    #
    #Thus, the output state can be described as:
    #
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each with an integer `n`. For each test case, it prints 'NO' if `n` is 1. Otherwise, it constructs a string of length `n` using uppercase letters from the alphabet and prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string. The string is formed by repeating each letter twice, with an extra 'AAA' if `n` is odd. The function does not modify the input values `t` and `n` beyond using them to determine the output.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`, which represents the number of special characters required in the string.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n == 1`. According to the problem description, there cannot be a single special character in a string because a special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors. Therefore, the program outputs "NO" for `n == 1`.

3. **String Construction:**
   - For even `n`, the program constructs a string by repeating pairs of distinct uppercase letters. For example, for `n=6`, it constructs a string like "AAABAACC". This string indeed has 6 special characters at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
   - For odd `n`, the program starts with "AAA" (which has 2 special characters) and then appends pairs of distinct uppercase letters. For example, for `n=3`, it constructs a string like "AAABB". This string has 3 special characters at positions 1, 3, and 4.

4. **Output:**
   - The program outputs "YES" followed by the constructed string if a suitable string can be formed.
   - It outputs "NO" if there is no suitable string (i.e., when `n == 1`).

5. **Constraints:**
   - The program constructs strings of length at most 200, which satisfies the problem's constraints.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly handles all cases as per the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
