Reasoning:  
The program aims to construct a string of uppercase Latin letters containing exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The program handles the input by iterating through `t` test cases. For each test case, it checks if `n` is 1. If so, it correctly outputs 'NO' because it's impossible to have exactly one special character in a string of length 1. For `n` greater than 1, the program constructs a string by repeating each letter twice. If `n` is odd, it starts with 'AAA' to ensure there is an odd number of special characters. The constructed string is then printed along with 'YES'. 

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the presence of special characters and constructs the required string according to the problem description. The execution summary provided aligns with the program's behavior, and the examples given in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program.

Correctness: **True**
