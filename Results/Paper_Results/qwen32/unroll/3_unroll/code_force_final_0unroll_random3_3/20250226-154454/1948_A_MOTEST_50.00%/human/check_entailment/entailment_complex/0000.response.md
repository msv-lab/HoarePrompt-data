### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by constructing a string with exactly `n` special characters for each test case. Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case, reading the integer `n` for each one.

2. **Special Case for `n = 1`**: The program correctly identifies that there is no suitable string if `n` is 1, as a single character cannot be special by definition. Therefore, it prints "NO" in this case.

3. **String Construction for `n > 1`**:
   - **Even `n`**: If `n` is even, the program constructs a string by repeating each letter from the alphabet twice. For example, for `n = 6`, the string "AAABAACC" is constructed, which has exactly 6 special characters.
   - **Odd `n`**: If `n` is odd, the program starts with "AAA" and then appends pairs of letters. For example, for `n = 5`, the string "AAABB" is constructed, which has exactly 5 special characters.

4. **Output**: For each test case, the program prints "YES" followed by the constructed string if a suitable string exists.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1 (`n = 6`)**:
  - The program constructs the string "AAABAACC".
  - This string has 6 special characters, satisfying the condition.
  - Output: `YES\nAAABAACC`

- **Test Case 2 (`n = 1`)**:
  - The program correctly identifies that no suitable string exists.
  - Output: `NO`

- **Test Case 3 (`n = 2`)**:
  - The program constructs the string "AABB".
  - This string has 2 special characters, satisfying the condition.
  - Output: `YES\nAABB`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all specified cases and constructs the required strings with the exact number of special characters as needed. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
