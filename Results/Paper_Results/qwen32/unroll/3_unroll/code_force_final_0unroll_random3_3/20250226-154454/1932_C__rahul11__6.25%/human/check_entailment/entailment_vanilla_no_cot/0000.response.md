Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Division by Element**: The program attempts to divide the product by an element when removing it, which is not valid for modular arithmetic. Instead, it should multiply by the modular multiplicative inverse of the element being removed.

2. **Modular Inverse Calculation**: The program does not calculate the modular multiplicative inverse, which is necessary for division in modular arithmetic. Without this, the division step is incorrect.

3. **Modulo Operation**: The program applies an extra modulo operation (`% MOD`) after each multiplication and division, which is unnecessary and incorrect. The modulo operation should only be applied after the multiplication to keep the numbers manageable and correct.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def mod_inverse(a, m):
    m0, x0, x1 = m, 0, 1
    if m == 1:
        return 0
    while a > 1:
        # q is quotient
        q = a // m
        m, a = a % m, m
        x0, x1 = x1 - q * x0, x0
    # Make x1 positive
    if x1 < 0:
        x1 += m0
    return x1

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = []
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans = (ans * i) % m
        res.append(ans)
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = (ans * mod_inverse(arr[l], m)) % m
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = (ans * mod_inverse(arr[r], m)) % m
                r -= 1
            res.append(ans)
        print(*res)

func()
```

This corrected version includes a function to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse and uses it to correctly handle the division in modular arithmetic.
