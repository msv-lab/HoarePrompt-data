### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to construct a permutation `p` of length `n` such that for each `i`, `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
- `MEX` of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
- We are given `a` and need to construct `p` based on the above relationship.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is initialized as an empty list to store the permutation `p`.
   - `minn` is initialized to 0, which is used to track the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `p`.
   - `maxx` is also initialized to 0 but is not used meaningfully in the program.

2. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the given array `a`:
     - If `arr[i]` is positive, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`.
     - If `arr[i]` is non-positive, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`.
   - The logic for handling positive and non-positive `arr[i]` values does not correctly align with the problem's requirements.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed `mex` list as the permutation `p`.

#### Issues with the Program:

- **Incorrect Handling of `MEX`**:
  - The program does not correctly calculate `MEX` for each prefix of `p`. Instead, it simply uses `minn` when `arr[i]` is positive and `abs(arr[i] - minn)` when `arr[i]` is non-positive. This approach does not guarantee that `p_i` will be the correct value such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

- **Lack of Used Numbers Tracking**:
  - The program does not keep track of the numbers that have already been used in the permutation `p`. This means it cannot ensure that each number from 0 to `n-1` appears exactly once in `p`.

- **Incorrect Calculation of `p_i`**:
  - The program does not correctly compute `p_i` based on the relationship `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. It simply uses the absolute difference when `arr[i]` is non-positive, which is not the correct approach.

#### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Initialize a set to keep track of used numbers.
2. For each `a_i`, compute the `MEX` of the current permutation `p`.
3. Determine `p_i` as `MEX + a_i`.
4. Ensure that `p_i` is a valid number (i.e., within the range 0 to `n-1` and not already used).
5. Add `p_i` to the permutation and mark it as used.

#### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It fails to construct the permutation `p` based on the relationship between `a` and `MEX`.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
