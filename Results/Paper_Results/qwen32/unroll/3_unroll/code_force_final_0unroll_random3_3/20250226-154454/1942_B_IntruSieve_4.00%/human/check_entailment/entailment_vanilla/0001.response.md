Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to construct a permutation `p` of length `n` such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
- `MEX` of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
- We are given `a` and need to construct `p` based on the above relationship.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `mex` as an empty list to store the permutation `p`.
   - `minn` is initialized to 0, which is used to track the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `p`.
   - `maxx` is initialized to 0, which is not used in a meaningful way in the program and can be ignored for this analysis.

2. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the given array `a`:
     - If `arr[i]` is positive, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`.
     - If `arr[i]` is non-positive, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`.
   - The logic for handling positive and non-positive `arr[i]` values seems incorrect based on the problem's requirement.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed `mex` list as the permutation `p`.

### Issues with the Program:
- The program does not correctly calculate the permutation `p` based on the given `a` array.
- The use of `minn` and the handling of positive and non-positive `arr[i]` values do not align with the problem's requirements.
- The program does not ensure that each number from 0 to `n-1` appears exactly once in `p`.
- The program does not correctly compute `MEX` for each prefix of `p`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Initialize a set to keep track of used numbers.
2. For each `a_i`, compute the `MEX` of the current permutation `p`.
3. Determine `p_i` as `MEX + a_i`.
4. Ensure that `p_i` is a valid number (i.e., within the range 0 to `n-1` and not already used).
5. Add `p_i` to the permutation and mark it as used.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It fails to construct the permutation `p` based on the relationship between `a` and `MEX`.

Correctness: **False**
