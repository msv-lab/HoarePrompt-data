Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap
- We need to reconstruct a permutation `p` from the array `a` where `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
- MEX is the minimum non-negative integer not present in the array.
- We are given multiple test cases.

### Analysis of the Provided Program

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the permutation) and the array `a`.

2. **Reconstruction of `p`:**
   - The program initializes `mex` as an empty list.
   - It also initializes `minn` and `maxx` to 0.
   - For each element in `a`, it either:
     - Appends `minn` to `mex` if `a[i] > 0` and increments `minn` (while ensuring `minn` is not equal to `maxx`).
     - Or, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex` if `a[i] <= 0` and updates `maxx` if necessary.

3. **Output:**
   - It prints the constructed `mex` list for each test case.

### Issues in the Program

- **Incorrect Handling of `MEX`:** The program does not correctly calculate the MEX of the current prefix of `p`. It incorrectly uses `minn` and `maxx` to determine the next value, which does not guarantee that the value is the smallest non-negative integer not in the current prefix of `p`.
- **Logic Flaw:** The program does not account for the correct relationship between `a[i]` and the MEX of the current prefix of `p`. Specifically, `a_i = MEX(p_1, ..., p_i) - p_i` means that `p_i = MEX(p_1, ..., p_i) - a_i`, not just `minn` or `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Maintain a set or list to keep track of the numbers already used in `p`.
- For each `a_i`, compute the MEX of the current prefix of `p`.
- Set `p_i` to `MEX(p_1, ..., p_i) - a_i`.

### Conclusion
Given the issues in the provided program, it does not correctly reconstruct the permutation `p` as required by the problem statement.

**Correctness: False**
