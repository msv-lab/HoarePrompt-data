The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `mex`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the integer input; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mex` is an empty list.**
