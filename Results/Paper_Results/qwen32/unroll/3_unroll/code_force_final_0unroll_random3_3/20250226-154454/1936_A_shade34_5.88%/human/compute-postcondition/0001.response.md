Output State: **The function `func()` has processed all test cases. For each test case, it has determined and output the indices `i` and `j` that maximize the bitwise XOR `p_i âŠ• p_j`. The function has used a series of queries to compare the bitwise OR of different pairs of elements in the hidden permutation to identify these indices. The state of variables `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans` is specific to the current test case and resets for each new test case. The external system has been queried up to 3n times per test case as required.**
