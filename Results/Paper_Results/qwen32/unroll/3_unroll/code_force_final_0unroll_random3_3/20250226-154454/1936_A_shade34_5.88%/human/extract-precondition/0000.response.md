Precondition: **The function `func()` does not take any input arguments. It interacts with an external system to receive the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), and for each test case, it receives an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a hidden permutation `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` of the set `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`. The function can ask up to 3n queries of the form "? a b c d" (0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n) to compare the bitwise OR of two pairs of elements from the permutation, and it must output the indices `i` and `j` (0 ≤ i, j < n) that maximize the bitwise XOR `p_i ⊕ p_j` for each test case.**
