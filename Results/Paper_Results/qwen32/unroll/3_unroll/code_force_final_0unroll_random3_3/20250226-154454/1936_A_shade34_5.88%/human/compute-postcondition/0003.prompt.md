You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func()` does not take any input arguments. It interacts with an external system to receive the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), and for each test case, it receives an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a hidden permutation `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` of the set `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`. The function can ask up to 3n queries of the form "? a b c d" (0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n) to compare the bitwise OR of two pairs of elements from the permutation, and it must output the indices `i` and `j` (0 ≤ i, j < n) that maximize the bitwise XOR `p_i ⊕ p_j` for each test case.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        mak = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
            sys.stdout.flush()
            if str(input()) == '<':
                mak = i
        
        mak2 = mak
        
        pans = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
            sys.stdout.flush()
            s = str(input())
            if s == '<':
                mak = i
                pans = [i]
            elif s == '=':
                pans.append(i)
        
        mak = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(pans)):
            print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
            sys.stdout.flush()
            if str(input()) == '>':
                mak = i
        
        print('!', mak2, mak)
        
        sys.stdout.flush()
        
    #State: The function `func()` has processed all test cases. For each test case, it has determined and output the indices `i` and `j` that maximize the bitwise XOR `p_i ⊕ p_j`. The function has used a series of queries to compare the bitwise OR of different pairs of elements in the hidden permutation to identify these indices. The state of variables `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans` is specific to the current test case and resets for each new test case. The external system has been queried up to 3n times per test case as required.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func` does not accept any input arguments. It receives the number of test cases `t` and, for each test case, an integer `n` representing the length of a hidden permutation. The function can query up to 3n times to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements from the permutation. It outputs the indices `i` and `j` that maximize the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
