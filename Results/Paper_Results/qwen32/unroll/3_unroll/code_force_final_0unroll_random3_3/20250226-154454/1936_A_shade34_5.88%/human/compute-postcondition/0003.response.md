Functionality: **The function `func()` processes multiple test cases, each involving a hidden permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. For each test case, it determines and outputs the indices `i` and `j` that maximize the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices. The function interacts with an external system to receive the number of test cases and the length of each permutation, and it queries up to 3n times per test case to compare the bitwise OR of different pairs of elements in the permutation.**
