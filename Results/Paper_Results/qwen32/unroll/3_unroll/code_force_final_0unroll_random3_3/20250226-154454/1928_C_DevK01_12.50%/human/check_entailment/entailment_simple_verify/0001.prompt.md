You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves determining the possible values of `k` such that a given position `n` and number `x` in the sequence match the described settling pattern. The pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and the pattern itself consists of the sequence `1, 2, ..., k, k-1, ..., 2` and then repeats.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` (Vasya's position) and `x` (the number Vasya received).

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The program checks if `(n + x) % 2 != 0`. If true, it prints `0` because the sum of the position and the number should be even for a valid `k`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to find divisors of `q` (which is `(y - 2) // 2` or `(n - x) // 2`) that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It checks if the square root of `q` is an integer and if it is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If so, it adds it to the list `M`.
   - It then iterates through all integers from `1` to `int(w // 1)` (which should be `int(w)`), checking if they are divisors of `q` and if they or their corresponding pair `q // i` are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

4. **Combining Results:**
   - The program calculates `L1` as the divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` that meet the criteria.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it also calculates divisors of `(n - x) // 2` and adds them to `L1`.
   - It removes duplicates by converting `L1` to a set and then back to a list.
   - Finally, it prints the length of `L1`, which represents the number of valid `k` values.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Divisor Calculation in `func_1`:**
   - The loop `for i in range(1, int(w // 1))` is incorrect. It should iterate up to `int(w) + 1` to include the square root itself if it is an integer.
   - The check `if w == w // 1` is not the correct way to check if `w` is an integer. Instead, use `if w.is_integer()`.

2. **Logic for Divisors:**
   - The program only considers the square root and its divisors, but it should consider all divisors of `q` that meet the criteria.

3. **Handling of `n >= 3 * x - 2`:**
   - The program correctly adds the divisors of `(n - x) // 2` if `n >= 3 * x - 2`, but it does not handle the edge cases properly.

4. **Output:**
   - The program correctly outputs the number of valid `k` values, but the logic to determine these values is flawed.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified, the program is not correct. The logic for finding divisors and handling the conditions is flawed, which can lead to incorrect results.

**Correctness: False**
