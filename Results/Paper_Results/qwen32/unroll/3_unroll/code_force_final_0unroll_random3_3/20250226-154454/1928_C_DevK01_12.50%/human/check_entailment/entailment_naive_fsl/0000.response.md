Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of different k values that fit under the given constraints. There are several issues with the code:

1. **Undefined Function `func_1`:** The function `func_1` is used in the code but is not defined. This will result in a `NameError` at runtime.

2. **Logic for Finding k Values:**
   - The logic to determine the values of k is not correctly implemented. The code uses a function `func_1` that is supposed to find divisors of a certain number, but the logic for determining which k values are valid is not clearly defined or correctly implemented.
   - The conditions and calculations for determining k values are not aligned with the problem description. For example, the calculation `y = n + x` and the condition `if y % 2 != 0` do not directly relate to the problem's requirements for finding k values.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, the problem specifies that k > 1, but the code does not explicitly enforce this constraint.
   - The code does not correctly handle the periodic nature of the settling pattern described in the problem. The pattern repeats every 2k - 2 positions, and the code does not correctly implement this periodicity.

4. **Example Test Cases:**
   - The code fails to produce the correct output for some of the provided example test cases. For example, for the input `10 2`, the correct output should be `4` (k = 2, 3, 5, 6), but the code does not produce this output.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
