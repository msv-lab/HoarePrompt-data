### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the problem requirements step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of possible values of `k` such that, given a position `n` and a number `x` received by Vasya, the described "settling" pattern fits.
   - The pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - For a given `k`, the pattern is: `1, 2, 3, ..., k, k-1, k-2, ..., 2`.
   - We need to determine how many `k` values exist such that at position `n`, the number `x` is received.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.
   - It calculates `y = n + x` and checks if `y` is even. If not, it prints `0` because the pattern cannot fit.
   - It then calls `func_1` twice under certain conditions:
     - `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` is always called.
     - `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` is called if `n >= 3 * x - 2`.
   - `func_1` calculates possible values of `k` by checking divisors of the input `q` and ensuring they meet the condition `i >= x - 1`.
   - The results from both calls to `func_1` are combined, duplicates are removed, and the length of the resulting list is printed.

3. **Evaluating the Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` seems to be designed to find divisors of `q` that are at least `x - 1`. This is a key part of the logic to determine possible `k` values.
   - However, the function `func_1` is incorrectly defined in the comments and the code. The parameter `q` is described as a list of tuples, but it is actually a single integer.
   - The logic inside `func_1` is correct for finding divisors, but the overall approach to determine `k` values needs to be re-evaluated.

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program uses the correct approach to check the parity of `y`.
   - The function `func_1` is correctly implemented for finding divisors, but its usage in the context of the problem is questionable.
   - The logic to combine results and remove duplicates is correct.
   - However, the overall logic to determine `k` values from the divisors is not fully aligned with the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the program has some logical flaws in how it determines the possible `k` values. Specifically, the function `func_1` is correctly implemented but used in a way that may not fully cover all possible `k` values that fit the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program is not entirely correct due to the way it determines the possible `k` values from the divisors. The logic for combining results and removing duplicates is correct, but the overall approach to determine `k` values needs to be re-evaluated.
