To determine what will be printed, let's break down the information given in the initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `cnt` is a list of integers, where each integer represents the count of sticks.
2. `ans` is the sum of the integer divisions of each stick count in `cnt` by 4.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Explanation:
- `ans` is calculated as the sum of integer divisions of each element in `cnt` by 4.
- The integer division (denoted by `//` in Python) of a number `n` by 4 gives the largest integer `k` such that `4 * k` is less than or equal to `n`.

### Output Description:
- The value of `ans` is computed by iterating over each element in the list `cnt`, performing an integer division by 4, and summing up these results.
- Since the exact values of `cnt` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe it in terms of the elements in `cnt`.

### Final Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the integer divisions of each stick count in cnt by 4)**
