The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. Given the initial state, the variable `n` holds the number of integers to be read, and the next line of input contains these integers.

The impact of the code is that it changes the value of `a` to be a list of integers read from the input. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of sticks available. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) — the stick lengths. `n` is an integer read from the input. `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
