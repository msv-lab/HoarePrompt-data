You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program: 
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
    return ma - mi + 2



- Annotated Code: 
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' in s.
def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; s is the string input by the user consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' in s; ma is 0; mi is the position (1-based index) of the first 'B' in s; m is the integer input by the user; c is the position (1-based index) of the first 'B' in s; d is 0; l is an empty list.
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
        
    #State: - `t` remains the same.
    #- `n` remains the same.
    #- `s` remains the same.
    #- `ma` is set to the position of the first 'B' from the start of the string when iterating from the end.
    #- `mi` remains the same.
    #- `m` remains the same.
    #- `c` remains the same.
    #- `d` is the position of the first 'B' from the end of the string.
    #- `l` remains the same.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `ma` will now hold the 0-based index of the first 'B' from the start of the string when counted from the end, and `d` will hold the 1-based index of this 'B' from the end of the string.
    #
    #Output State:
    return ma - mi + 2
    #The program returns ma - mi + 2, where ma is the 0-based index of the first 'B' from the start of the string when counted from the end, and mi is the given value of mi.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly determine the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white in order for all cells to become white. Let's analyze the code and find a counterexample.

The code attempts to find the first and last occurrence of the character 'B' in the string and then calculates the length of the segment from the first 'B' to the last 'B' plus 2. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum length of a segment that can turn all cells white.

Consider the following test case:

```
Input:
1
5
BBWBW
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

Explanation of the expected output: The minimum segment that can be painted white to turn all cells white is from index 1 to 3 (0-based indexing), which covers the substring "BBW". Painting this segment white will turn the entire string white.

However, the provided code will output:

```
Output:
5
```

Explanation of the code's output: The first 'B' is at index 0, and the last 'B' is at index 3. The code calculates the length as `3 - 0 + 2 = 5`, which is incorrect.

This example shows that the code does not handle all cases correctly, and thus it is not correct.

Therefore, the Correctness is **False**.
