Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' in `s`. The function returns `ma - mi + 2`, where `ma` is the 0-based index of the first 'B' from the end of the string, and `mi` is the 0-based index of the first 'B' from the start of the string.**
