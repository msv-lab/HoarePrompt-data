You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' in s.
def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; s is the string input by the user consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' in s; ma is 0; mi is the position (1-based index) of the first 'B' in s; m is the integer input by the user; c is the position (1-based index) of the first 'B' in s; d is 0; l is an empty list.
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
        
    #State: - `t` remains the same.
    #- `n` remains the same.
    #- `s` remains the same.
    #- `ma` is set to the position of the first 'B' from the start of the string when iterating from the end.
    #- `mi` remains the same.
    #- `m` remains the same.
    #- `c` remains the same.
    #- `d` is the position of the first 'B' from the end of the string.
    #- `l` remains the same.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `ma` will now hold the 0-based index of the first 'B' from the start of the string when counted from the end, and `d` will hold the 1-based index of this 'B' from the end of the string.
    #
    #Output State:
    return ma - mi + 2
    #The program returns ma - mi + 2, where ma is the 0-based index of the first 'B' from the start of the string when counted from the end, and mi is the given value of mi.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' in `s`. The function returns `ma - mi + 2`, where `ma` is the 0-based index of the first 'B' from the end of the string, and `mi` is the 0-based index of the first 'B' from the start of the string.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns ma - mi + 2, where ma is the 0-based index of the first 'B' from the start of the string when counted from the end, and mi is the given value of mi.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
