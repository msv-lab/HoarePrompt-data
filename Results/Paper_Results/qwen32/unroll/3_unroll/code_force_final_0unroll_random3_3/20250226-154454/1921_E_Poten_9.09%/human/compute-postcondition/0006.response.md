Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives six integers `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b`. Here, `h` and `w` are the dimensions of a grid, and `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` are coordinates of two distinct points on the grid. The function returns a result for each test case based on the provided coordinates and grid dimensions.**
