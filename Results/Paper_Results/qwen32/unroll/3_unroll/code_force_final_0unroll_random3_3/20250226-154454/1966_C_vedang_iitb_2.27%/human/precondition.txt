a is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of a is n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. Additionally, each element a_i in a satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function is called once for each test case, and the number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
