The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `w`, so we can only adjust those for the loop to execute. The loop will execute if `w` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted in the state before the loop starts.

Given the provided state, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `w` is greater than 0 to allow the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `w` must be greater than 0**
