You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        print(shapes)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then calculates and prints the number of sets of three or more identical integers in the list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Find the maximum number of regular (equal-sided) polygons that can be formed using the given sticks, where each polygon requires at least 3 sticks of the same length.
2. **Constraints**:
   - Each stick can be used in at most one polygon.
   - Sticks cannot be broken.
   - The polygons must be regular, meaning all sides must be of equal length.
3. **Output**: For each test case, output the maximum number of such polygons.

### Program Analysis:
The program follows these steps:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - It reads the number of test cases `w`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `ln` and the list of stick lengths `palka`.
2. **Counting Stick Frequencies**:
   - It initializes an empty dictionary `d` to count the frequency of each stick length.
   - It iterates over the list of stick lengths and updates the count in the dictionary `d`.
3. **Calculating the Number of Polygons**:
   - It initializes a variable `shapes` to count the number of polygons.
   - It iterates over the unique stick lengths (stored in `pl`).
   - For each unique stick length `j`, if there are at least 3 sticks of that length, it calculates how many polygons can be formed by dividing the count of that stick by 3 (`d[j] // 3`) and adds this to `shapes`.
4. **Output**:
   - It prints the number of polygons `shapes` for each test case.

### Evaluation:
- **Counting Stick Frequencies**: The program correctly counts the frequency of each stick length using a dictionary.
- **Calculating Polygons**: The program correctly calculates the number of polygons by dividing the count of each stick by 3 (integer division) and summing them up.
- **Handling Edge Cases**:
  - If there are fewer than 3 sticks of any length, no polygon can be formed from those sticks, which is correctly handled by the condition `if d[j] >= 3`.
  - If there are no sticks at all (`ln = 0`), the loop will not execute, and the output will be `0`, which is correct.
  - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading and processing each test case independently.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It counts the frequency of each stick length and calculates the maximum number of polygons that can be formed by using integer division to determine how many polygons can be made from each set of sticks of the same length.

Therefore, **Correctness: True**.
