Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string according to the problem description. Here's why:

1. The problem statement describes a specific encoding process where each character in the original string `s` is replaced by its symmetric character from the string `r` (which consists of all distinct letters of `s` in alphabetical order).

2. The decoding process should reverse this encoding. To do that, we need to:
   - Determine the string `r` from the encoded string `b` by identifying the distinct characters in `b` and sorting them.
   - Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character in `r`.
   - Replace each character in `b` with its corresponding character from the mapping to get the original string `s`.

3. The provided `func_1` function, however, does not follow this process. Instead, it attempts to map each character in the encoded string to a unique character from 'a' to 'z' without considering the symmetric property described in the problem. This results in incorrect decoding.

4. Specifically, the loop that assigns characters from 'a' to 'z' to characters in `encoded` does not ensure that the characters are mapped symmetrically, which is essential for decoding the string correctly.

Correctness: **False**
