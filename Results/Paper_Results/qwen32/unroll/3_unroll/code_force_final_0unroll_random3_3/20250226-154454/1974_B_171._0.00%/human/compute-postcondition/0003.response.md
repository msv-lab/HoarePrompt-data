Let's analyze the loop step-by-step to understand the final state.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `mapping` is an initially empty dictionary.
   - `decoded` is an initially empty list.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each character `char` in the string `encoded`.
   - For each character `char`:
     - If `char` is already in the `mapping` dictionary, it appends the corresponding value (which is a unique character from 'a' to 'z') to the `decoded` list.
     - If `char` is not in the `mapping` dictionary, it finds the next available character `c` from 'a' to 'z' that is not already a value in the `mapping` dictionary. It then adds the pair `(char, chr(c))` to the `mapping` dictionary and appends `chr(c)` to the `decoded` list.

3. **Outcome:**
   - The `mapping` dictionary will map each unique character in `encoded` to a unique character from 'a' to 'z'.
   - The `decoded` list will contain a sequence of characters where each character in the original `encoded` string is replaced by its corresponding unique character from 'a' to 'z' as defined in the `mapping` dictionary.

Given these steps, the final state of the variables is:
- `encoded` remains the same.
- `mapping` is a dictionary that maps each unique character in `encoded` to a unique character from 'a' to 'z'.
- `decoded` is a list of characters where each character in `encoded` is replaced by its corresponding unique character from 'a' to 'z' as defined in the `mapping` dictionary.

Output State: **`encoded` is unchanged; `mapping` is a dictionary mapping each unique character in `encoded` to a unique character from 'a' to 'z'; `decoded` is a list of characters where each character in `encoded` is replaced by its corresponding unique character from 'a' to 'z' as defined in the `mapping` dictionary.**
