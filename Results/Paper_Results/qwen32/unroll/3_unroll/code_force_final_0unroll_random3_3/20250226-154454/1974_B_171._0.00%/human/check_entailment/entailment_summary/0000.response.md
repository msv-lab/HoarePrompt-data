Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly decode the string as described in the problem statement. The program attempts to map each unique character in the encoded string to a unique character from 'a' to 'z' in a sequential manner, which does not match the described decoding algorithm. 

The correct decoding process involves:
1. Identifying the set of unique characters in the encoded string and sorting them alphabetically.
2. Creating a mapping where each character in the sorted unique set is mapped to its symmetric character in the reverse order of the sorted unique set.
3. Using this mapping to decode the encoded string.

The provided code does not perform these steps. Instead, it maps each unique character in the encoded string to the next available character from 'a' to 'z', which does not correspond to the symmetric character mapping required by the problem statement.

Therefore, the program does not correctly decode the string as per the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
