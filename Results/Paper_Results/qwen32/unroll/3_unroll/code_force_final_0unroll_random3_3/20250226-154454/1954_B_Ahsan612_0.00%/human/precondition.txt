test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of the array, and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the elements of the array. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. Each provided array a is guaranteed to be beautiful.
