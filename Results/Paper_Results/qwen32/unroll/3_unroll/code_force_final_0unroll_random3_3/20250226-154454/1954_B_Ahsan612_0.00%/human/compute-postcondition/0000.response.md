In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the variable `_`, which is a throwaway variable in Python, and the range is determined by `int(input())`. This means the loop will execute `int(input())` times. The state before the loop starts includes `t`, `n`, and `a`, but according to the instructions, we can only adjust the state of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the input that determines the range of the loop.

Since the loop is `for _ in range(int(input())):`, the number of iterations is determined by the value of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. However, since `t` is described as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `t` is the number of test cases, we need to ensure that `int(input())` reflects this value.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `int(input())` should be equal to `t`, which is the number of test cases.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `int(input())` must be equal to `t`**
