Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the properties of the list `a`, which is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition.**
