The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is already an integer within the range 1 to 10^4. The execution of the code snippet will update the value of `t` to the new integer input provided.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value read from input, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b`, `m` <= 10^18.**
