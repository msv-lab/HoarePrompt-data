Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time based on the problem description. The logic in the program is incorrect as it simply adds the integer divisions of `m` by `a` and `m` by `b` and then adds 2, which does not account for the overlap of fireworks' visibility periods.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be visible at the same time. This involves considering the periodicity of the fireworks launches and their visibility duration. Specifically, we need to find a time `t` within the visibility period `[0, m]` where the number of overlapping fireworks is maximized. This can be achieved by iterating over potential launch times within the visibility period and counting the number of visible fireworks from both installations at each time.

The given program's logic (`m // a + m // b + 2`) does not address this requirement and hence is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
