The function `func` accepts multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes three integer parameters: `a`, `b`, and `m`, where `1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18`. The function processes each test case individually and returns the result based on the given inputs. Since the specific logic of the function is not provided, we can only describe the parameters and the fact that it returns some result for each test case. 

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` within the range 1 to 10^18, and returns a result for each test case.**
