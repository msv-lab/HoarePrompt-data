Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `func`, which is a function, and returns `wrapper`.

    #The program returns the value associated with the key `args` in the dictionary `d`. If `args` was not in `d` before the function was called, it has now been added with the value `func(*args)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `args` containing any values. It returns the value associated with the key `args` in the dictionary `d`. If `args` was not in `d` before the function was called, it computes `func(*args)`, adds `args` to `d` with this value, and then returns this value.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters and does not contribute directly to solving the problem based on the provided code snippet. It appears to be a utility function intended to read a line from standard input and strip any leading or trailing whitespace.
def func_2():

def func_4(delimiter):

    #The program returns a list of integers derived from splitting the string returned by `func_2()` using the `delimiter`.

A is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 2 * 10^9 and a_i < a_{i+1}. D is a list of m integers where 1 <= d_i <= 10^9. F is a list of k integers where 1 <= f_i <= 10^9.

    #This is printed: max(ans, next_max_diff) (where ans is the minimum of its initial value and the calculated differences for each f in F, and next_max_diff is another value being compared)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and prints the maximum of two values: the largest difference between consecutive elements in a sorted list `A`, and a computed minimum difference based on elements from lists `D` and `F`. The computed minimum difference is determined by finding the optimal element in `D` for each element in `F` to minimize the maximum of two specific differences.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It performs a series of operations based on the number of test cases, which is determined by the value returned from `func_3()`. The function iterates through each test case by calling `func_6()` for each one. After completing the iterations, the function does not return any specific value or modify the input parameters.
