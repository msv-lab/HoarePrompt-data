Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Query Handling**:
   - The code uses `bisect_left` to find the first segment that starts at or after the left boundary `l` of the query. However, it does not correctly handle the case where multiple segments overlap the query range `[l, r]`.
   - The logic for determining the indices `i` and `j` is flawed. It does not correctly check for different elements within the specified range `[l, r]`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where all elements in the range `[l, r]` are the same. It should output `-1 -1` in such cases.
   - The code does not correctly handle cases where the range `[l, r]` spans multiple segments with different elements.

### Example of Incorrect Output:
Consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
2
1 5
2 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 2
2 3
```

**Actual Output from the Code:**
```
1 2
-1 -1
```

The second query `[2, 4]` should return `2 3` because `nums[2] = 1` and `nums[3] = 2` are different, but the code incorrectly returns `-1 -1`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the code should:
1. Iterate through the range `[l, r]` for each query.
2. Check for the first pair of different elements within this range.
3. If no such pair is found, output `-1 -1`.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
from sys import stdin

def main():
    tc = int(stdin.readline())
    for _ in range(tc):
        N = int(stdin.readline())
        nums = list(map(int, stdin.readline().split()))
        q = int(stdin.readline())
        for _ in range(q):
            l, r = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
            l -= 1
            r -= 1
            found = False
            for i in range(l, r):
                for j in range(i + 1, r + 1):
                    if nums[i] != nums[j]:
                        print(i + 1, j + 1)
                        found = True
                        break
                if found:
                    break
            if not found:
                print(-1, -1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected code correctly handles all cases and ensures that for each query, it finds a pair of different elements or reports that no such pair exists.
