Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer assigned the value of the first test case from the input; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with an additional element `-1` appended to it; `s` is 0; `e` is 0; `num` is `nums[0]`; `arr` is an empty list.**

In simple terms, the list `nums` now includes an extra element `-1` at the end. All other variables retain their initial values.
