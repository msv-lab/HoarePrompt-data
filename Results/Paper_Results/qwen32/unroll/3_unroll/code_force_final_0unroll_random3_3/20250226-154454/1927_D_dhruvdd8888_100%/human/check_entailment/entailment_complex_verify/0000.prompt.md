You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Query Handling**:
   - The code uses `bisect_left` to find the first segment that starts at or after the left boundary `l` of the query. However, it does not correctly handle the case where multiple segments overlap the query range `[l, r]`.
   - The logic for determining the indices `i` and `j` is flawed. It does not correctly check for different elements within the specified range `[l, r]`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where all elements in the range `[l, r]` are the same. It should output `-1 -1` in such cases.
   - The code does not correctly handle cases where the range `[l, r]` spans multiple segments with different elements.

### Example of Incorrect Output:
Consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
2
1 5
2 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 2
2 3
```

**Actual Output from the Code:**
```
1 2
-1 -1
```

The second query `[2, 4]` should return `2 3` because `nums[2] = 1` and `nums[3] = 2` are different, but the code incorrectly returns `-1 -1`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the code should:
1. Iterate through the range `[l, r]` for each query.
2. Check for the first pair of different elements within this range.
3. If no such pair is found, output `-1 -1`.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
from sys import stdin

def main():
    tc = int(stdin.readline())
    for _ in range(tc):
        N = int(stdin.readline())
        nums = list(map(int, stdin.readline().split()))
        q = int(stdin.readline())
        for _ in range(q):
            l, r = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
            l -= 1
            r -= 1
            found = False
            for i in range(l, r):
                for j in range(i + 1, r + 1):
                    if nums[i] != nums[j]:
                        print(i + 1, j + 1)
                        found = True
                        break
                if found:
                    break
            if not found:
                print(-1, -1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected code correctly handles all cases and ensures that for each query, it finds a pair of different elements or reports that no such pair exists.
