### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve the problem of finding two different elements within specified subarrays for multiple queries. Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Input Parsing and Preprocessing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `N`, the array `nums` itself, and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then processes the array to create an auxiliary list `arr` that contains segments of the array where the elements are the same. Each segment is represented as a tuple `(start_index, end_index, value)`. The array `nums` is augmented with an extra `-1` to handle edge cases gracefully.

2. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `l` and `r`.
   - It uses `bisect_left` to find the position in the `arr` list where the segment starting index is just greater than or equal to `l`.
   - It then checks the segment starting at this position. If the segment starts after `l`, it checks if the previous segment ends before `l` or if the current segment starts after `r`. If either condition is true, it prints `-1 -1`.
   - If the segment ends after `r`, it prints `-1 -1`.
   - If the segment ends before `N` or after `l`, it prints the start and end indices of the segment.
   - Otherwise, it prints `-1 -1`.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Preprocessing**: The preprocessing step correctly identifies segments of the array where the elements are the same. This is crucial for efficiently answering the queries.
   - **Query Handling**: The query handling logic is flawed. The program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, it does not ensure that the indices `i` and `j` are within the range `[l, r]` and that `a_i â‰  a_j`. The logic for checking the segments and printing the indices is incorrect and does not cover all possible scenarios.

### Example of Incorrectness:

Consider the following test case:

```
1
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

The correct output should be:

```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

However, the given program might not produce this output correctly due to the flawed logic in handling the segments and indices.

### Conclusion:

The program's logic for handling queries is flawed, and it does not correctly find two different elements within the specified subarrays for all queries. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
