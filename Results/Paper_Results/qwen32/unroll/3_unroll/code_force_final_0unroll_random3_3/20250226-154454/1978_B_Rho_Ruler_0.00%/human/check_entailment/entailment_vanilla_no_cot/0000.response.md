Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain. The binary search is not set up to maximize the profit but rather checks if a certain value of `k` satisfies a condition that is not related to maximizing profit. The `func_1` function also does not compute the profit correctly.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the profit for different values of `k` and determine which value of `k` gives the maximum profit. Here's the corrected approach:

1. For each test case, compute the profit for different values of `k` from 0 to `min(n, b)`.
2. The profit for a given `k` is calculated as:
   - Sell the first `k` buns at the modified price: \(\sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - i + 1)\)
   - Sell the remaining \(n - k\) buns at the usual price: \(a \times (n - k)\)
3. The sum of these two values gives the total profit for a given `k`.
4. Track the maximum profit across all possible values of `k`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def calculate_profit(k, a, b, n):
    # Calculate the profit for selling the first k buns at the modified price
    modified_price_profit = sum(b - i + 1 for i in range(1, k + 1))
    # Calculate the profit for selling the remaining (n - k) buns at the usual price
    usual_price_profit = a * (n - k)
    # Total profit
    return modified_price_profit + usual_price_profit

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        # Iterate over all possible values of k from 0 to min(n, b)
        for k in range(min(n, b) + 1):
            profit = calculate_profit(k, a, b, n)
            if profit > max_profit:
                max_profit = profit
        print(max_profit)
```

This code will correctly compute the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given promotion rules.
