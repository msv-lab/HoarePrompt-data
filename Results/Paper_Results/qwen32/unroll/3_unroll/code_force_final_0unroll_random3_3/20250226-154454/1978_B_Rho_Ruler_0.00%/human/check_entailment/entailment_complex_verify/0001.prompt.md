You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b), a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n`. It calculates a value based on these parameters and returns `True` if this calculated value is less than or equal to `n` times the maximum of `a` and `b`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

Bob wants to maximize his profit from selling `n` buns. He can choose an integer `k` where `0 <= k <= min(n, b)`. For the first `k` buns, he can sell them at decreasing prices starting from `b` down to `b - k + 1`. The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`. The goal is to find the value of `k` that maximizes the total profit.

### Program Analysis

The given program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum `k` that satisfies a condition. However, the condition checked in `func_1` is incorrect for maximizing profit. Let's break down the program:

1. **Binary Search Setup**:
   - `low` is initialized to 0.
   - `high` is initialized to `n`.
   - `ans` is initialized to -1.

2. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `low <= high`.
   - `mid` is calculated as the average of `low` and `high`.
   - The function `func_1(mid, a, b, n)` is called to check if the current `mid` (which represents `k`) is valid.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it means `mid` (or `k`) is valid, and `ans` is updated to `mid`. The search continues in the higher half by setting `low` to `mid + 1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, the search continues in the lower half by setting `high` to `mid - 1`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the total revenue if `k` buns are sold at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price.
   - It checks if the total revenue is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`. However, this condition does not help in finding the maximum profit because it does not compare different possible profits for different values of `k`.

### Correctness Analysis

The given program does not correctly determine the maximum profit because:
- The condition in `func_1` does not help in maximizing the profit.
- The program does not actually calculate the profit for each `k` and compare them to find the maximum.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Iterate over all possible values of `k` from 0 to `min(n, b)`.
2. For each `k`, calculate the total profit.
3. Keep track of the maximum profit found.

### Conclusion

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the maximum profit. The binary search and the condition in `func_1` are not suitable for this problem.

Correctness: **False**
