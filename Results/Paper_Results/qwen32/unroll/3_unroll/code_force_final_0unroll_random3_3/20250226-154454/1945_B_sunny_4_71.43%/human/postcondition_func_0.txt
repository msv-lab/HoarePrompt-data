The function reads a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. It then calculates and prints the sum of `A` and `B`, where `A` is `int(m / a) + 1` and `B` is `int(m / b) + 1`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged after processing each test case.
