You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Breakdown
The robot starts at (1, 1) and needs to reach (2, n). The robot can move in four directions initially, but then it must follow the arrow in the cell it lands in. The arrows can point left, right, up, or down, but no arrow points outside the grid. The goal is to determine if there is a path from (1, 1) to (2, n).

### Program Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads `t`, the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, the number of columns, and two strings `a` and `b` representing the arrows in the first and second rows, respectively.

2. **Immediate Check:**
   - The program first checks if the second last character in the second row (`b[-2]`) is not `>`. If it's not, it immediately prints 'NO'. This is because to reach (2, n), the robot must be able to move right from (2, n-1) to (2, n).

3. **Handling n == 1:**
   - If `n == 1`, the robot can't move to (2, n) because there's only one column. However, the program incorrectly prints 'YES' in this case. But since `n` is guaranteed to be even and at least 2, this case won't occur.

4. **Checking Even Columns:**
   - The program then checks if all even-indexed positions in the second row (`b[k]` for `k` in `range(0, n, 2)`) are `>`. If any of these positions are not `>`, it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - If `no_path` is still `True` after this check, it then checks if all odd-indexed positions in the first row (`a[k]` for `k` in `range(1, n - 1, 2)`) are `>`. If any of these positions are not `>`, it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - Finally, if `no_path` is still `True`, it prints 'YES', indicating that the robot can reach (2, n). Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Correctness Issues
- **Immediate Check:** The immediate check for `b[-2]` is correct because the robot must be able to move right from (2, n-1) to (2, n).
- **Even Columns Check:** The check for even-indexed positions in the second row is also correct because the robot needs to move right from these positions to eventually reach (2, n).
- **Odd Columns Check in First Row:** The check for odd-indexed positions in the first row is incorrect. The robot doesn't necessarily need to move right from these positions to reach (2, n). Instead, it could move down from (1, k) to (2, k) and then move right in the second row.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle all cases because the check for odd-indexed positions in the first row is incorrect. The robot can still reach (2, n) even if there are some `<` arrows in the odd-indexed positions of the first row, as long as the path can be constructed using the arrows in the second row.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**
