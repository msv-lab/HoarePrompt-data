The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it checks if it's possible to pair each '<' with a '>' in two strings of equal length, where the pairs are either non-overlapping within the same string or one character is in the first string and the paired character is in the second string. It outputs "YES" if such pairing is possible and "NO" otherwise.
