t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. The first row and the second row of the grid are strings of length n, consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'. There are no arrows pointing outside the grid.
