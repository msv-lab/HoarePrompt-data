In the provided code snippet, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. The loop variable `t` is used as the range parameter for the `range` function. To ensure that the loop executes, we need to focus on the variable `t` in the loop head.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop variable `t` is used in the `range` function, which means the loop will execute `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be at least 1.
3. The initial state provided is that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, which already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute.
4. The variables `n` and `a` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute based on the given state.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**
