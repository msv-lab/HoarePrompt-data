You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

    #State: a series of strings `r` for each test case, where each string `r` is constructed by the described process.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's examine the given Python program to see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap
We need to reconstruct a string `s` from its trace `a`. The trace `a` is an array of integers where `a_i` is the number of indices `j` (with `j < i`) such that `s_i = s_j`.

### Program Analysis
The program provided attempts to reconstruct the string `s` from its trace `a` as follows:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `a = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`: This is the string containing all lowercase Latin letters.
   - `b = [0] * 26`: This is a list that keeps track of the count of each letter used so far in the reconstructed string `s`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - `n = int(input())`: Reads the length of the string `s`.
   - `s = list(map(int, input().split()))`: Reads the trace `a` as a list of integers.
   - `r = ''`: Initializes an empty string `r` which will be the reconstructed string.

3. **Reconstructing the String**:
   - For each element `i` in the trace `s`:
     - `x = b.index(i)`: Finds the index `x` in `b` where the value is `i`. This means it finds the next available letter that has been used `i` times so far.
     - `r += a[x]`: Appends the letter at index `x` in the alphabet string `a` to `r`.
     - `b[x] += 1`: Increments the count of the letter at index `x` in `b`.

### Issues in the Program
The key issue with the program is in the line `x = b.index(i)`. The `index` method finds the first occurrence of the value `i` in the list `b`. However, this does not guarantee that the letter corresponding to `x` is the next available letter to use. The `index` method will always return the first occurrence, which may not be the correct letter to append to `r` given the trace `a`.

### Example
Consider the trace `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4]`. The program will incorrectly reconstruct the string because `b.index(i)` does not correctly determine the next available letter.

### Correct Approach
A correct approach would involve using a dictionary to keep track of the counts of each letter and then choosing the correct letter based on the trace.

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the next available letter to append to the reconstructed string based on the trace.

**Correctness: False**
