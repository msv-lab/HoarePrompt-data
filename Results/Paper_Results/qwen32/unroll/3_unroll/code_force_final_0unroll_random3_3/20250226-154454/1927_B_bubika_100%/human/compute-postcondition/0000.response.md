The code snippet provided assigns the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` to the variable `a`. This means that the variable `a` which was previously a list of integers is now reassigned to be a string containing all lowercase letters of the English alphabet. The other variables `t`, `n`, and the original list `a` (which is now overshadowed by the new `a`) remain unchanged in terms of their initial described properties.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that for the given trace, there exists a suitable string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z.**
