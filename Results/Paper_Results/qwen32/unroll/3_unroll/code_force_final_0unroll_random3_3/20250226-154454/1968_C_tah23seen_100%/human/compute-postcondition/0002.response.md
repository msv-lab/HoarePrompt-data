To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head. The loop condition is `i >= 0`.

Given:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \).
- `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \).
- The length of `arr` is \( n - 1 \).
- `ans` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is `10`.
- `i` is \( n - 2 \).

The loop condition is `i >= 0`. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be greater than or equal to 0.

Let's analyze the value of `i` right before the loop:
- `i` is initialized to \( n - 2 \).

For `i` to be greater than or equal to 0:
\[ n - 2 \geq 0 \]
\[ n \geq 2 \]

Since `n` is already given to be in the range \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \), the condition \( n \geq 2 \) is always satisfied. Therefore, `i` will always be greater than or equal to 0 as long as `n` is within the specified range.

No adjustments are needed to the state of `i` or `n` because they already satisfy the condition for the loop to execute the first time.

Thus, the state right before the loop can remain unchanged.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \), `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \), and the length of `arr` is \( n - 1 \); `ans` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is `10`; `i` is \( n - 2 \)**
