The code snippet initializes a list `ans` with `n` elements, each set to `10 ** 9`. The values of `arr` and `n` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, and the length of `arr` is n-1; `ans` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is `10 ** 9`.**
