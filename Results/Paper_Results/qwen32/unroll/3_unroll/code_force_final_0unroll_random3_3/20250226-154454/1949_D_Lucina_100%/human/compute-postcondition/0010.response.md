Postcondition: **`a` will contain the count of 'F' relationships for each node (including self-loops); `b` will contain the count of 'S' relationships for each node (including self-loops); `xx` will contain the initial empty string followed by the `n` lines of input; `sa` will contain the indices of nodes that have 'F' relationships but no 'S' relationships; `sb` will contain the indices of nodes that have 'S' relationships but no 'F' relationships; the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.**
