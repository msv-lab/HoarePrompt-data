n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. The next n lines describe the partial transition video plan where each line contains n characters. The j-th character of the i-th line corresponds to the transition video between the i-th and the j-th scenarios. It will be 'F' if the corresponding transition video will be funny, 'S' if the corresponding transition video will be scary, '?' if the corresponding transition video is still undecided, or '.' if i=j. It is guaranteed that the i-th character of the j-th line and the j-th character of the i-th line will be the same for all i and j. At most floor(n/2) transition videos will already be decided, meaning at most 2*floor(n/2) characters in the input will be 'F' or 'S'.
