Output State: **Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of array `a`, and `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`. The list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of array `a` remains unchanged. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**

In simple terms, the variable `n` is now assigned the integer value provided by the input, while the array `a` and its elements remain as they were described in the initial state.
