The code snippet reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was already assigned the length of the array from a previous input. The list `a` is now populated with `n` integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of array `a`; `a` is a list of `n` integers (`a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) where each `a_i` satisfies (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9).**
