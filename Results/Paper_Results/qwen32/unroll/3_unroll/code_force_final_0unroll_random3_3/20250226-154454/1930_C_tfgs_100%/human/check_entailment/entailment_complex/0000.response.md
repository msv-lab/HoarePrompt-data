### Reasoning:
1. **Initial Transformation**: The program first modifies the array `a` such that each element `a_i` is replaced by `a_i + i + 1`. This is in line with the problem statement where we need to insert `a_i + i` into the set `S`.

2. **Unique Elements**: The program then converts the modified array into a set to ensure all elements are unique, as sets do not allow duplicate values. This means that any duplicate values resulting from the transformation `a_i + i + 1` are removed.

3. **Sorting**: The program sorts the unique elements in descending order. This step is correct because the problem requires constructing array `b` which is `S` sorted in decreasing order.

4. **Handling Duplicates**: The program uses a `Counter` to keep track of the number of occurrences of each element in the original modified array. It then calculates how many additional elements need to be inserted to reach the required length `n`. These additional elements are inserted in a way that maintains the descending order.

5. **Final Construction**: The program constructs the final array `ans` by including all unique elements first and then adding the necessary additional elements to reach the length `n`. The additional elements are inserted in descending order, ensuring that the resulting array `b` is lexicographically as large as possible.

6. **Output**: The program prints the elements of `ans` separated by spaces, which is the required output format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the steps described in the problem statement. It handles the transformation, uniqueness, sorting, and additional element insertion correctly to produce the lexicographically largest array `b`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
