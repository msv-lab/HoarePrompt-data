Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem by modifying the input array `a` according to the rules specified: each element `a_i` is increased by its index `i + 1`, and then only unique values are considered to form the set `S`. The program then constructs the array `b` by sorting the unique values in `S` in descending order and filling any remaining positions with the largest possible values to ensure the array `b` has length `n`.

Let's break down the steps of the program:

1. **Modification of Array `a`:** Each element `a_i` is modified to `a_i + i + 1`. This step is correctly implemented.

2. **Handling Uniqueness:** The program converts the modified array to a set to remove duplicates. This is correct as the set `S` should only contain unique elements.

3. **Sorting and Construction of `b`:** The program sorts the unique elements in descending order. It then fills the remaining positions in `b` with values that are just less than the last added value to ensure the array `b` is as large as possible lexicographically.

4. **Edge Cases:** The program handles cases where there are fewer unique elements than `n` by filling the remaining positions with the largest possible values.

The logic and implementation of the program align with the problem requirements and the execution summary provided. The program correctly constructs the lexicographically largest array `b` as required.

Correctness: **True**
