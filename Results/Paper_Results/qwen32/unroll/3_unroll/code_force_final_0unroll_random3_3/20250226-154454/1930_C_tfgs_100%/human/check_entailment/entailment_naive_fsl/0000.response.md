Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description. Specifically, the program does not guarantee to produce the lexicographically largest array `b` because it does not account for the optimal selection of indices in the three-step operation. The goal is to maximize the value of `a_i + i` at each step to ensure that the final set `S` contains the largest possible values.

Here is an example that demonstrates the issue:

**Example:**
Input:
```
1
3
6 4 8
```

**Expected Output:**
```
11 7 6
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Operation 1: Select `i = 3` (last element), insert `a_3 + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11` into `S`, delete `a_3` from `a`. Now `a = [6, 4]`.
- Operation 2: Select `i = 2` (last element), insert `a_2 + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6` into `S`, delete `a_2` from `a`. Now `a = [6]`.
- Operation 3: Select `i = 1` (last element), insert `a_1 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7` into `S`, delete `a_1` from `a`. Now `a = []`.
- Final `S = {11, 7, 6}`, sorted in decreasing order is `b = [11, 7, 6]`.

**Actual Output of Provided Program:**
The provided program, however, does not guarantee this optimal selection. It simply adds `a_i + i` for each `i` and then sorts the unique values in decreasing order, which may not yield the lexicographically largest `b`.

**Why the Program is Incorrect:**
The program does not consider the optimal order of selecting indices `i` to maximize the values in `S`. It simply processes the array in a fixed manner without considering the best possible choices at each step to ensure the largest lexicographical order.

Thus, the program does not meet the problem requirements for every potential case, and therefore, it is incorrect.
