The code snippet provided initializes an empty list `ans`. None of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `counter`, `cur`, `cnt`) are modified by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5); `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order; `counter` is a Counter object that stores the frequency of each element in the modified list `a`; `cur` is 0; `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is an empty list.**
