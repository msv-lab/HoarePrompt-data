You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `n`, and for each test case, it prints the largest divisor of `x` that is greater than or equal to `n`, or the largest quotient `x // i` that is greater than or equal to `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided program is designed to find the maximum balance of a problemset by breaking up a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of the sub-problems equals `x`, and the balance is defined as the GCD of the difficulties of all sub-problems.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the integers `x` and `n`.
3. It then iterates through all possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the integer square root of `x`.
4. For each divisor `i`, it checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` or `n` is less than or equal to `i`. If either condition is true, it updates the answer `ans` to be the maximum of the current `ans` and `i` or `x // i`.
5. Finally, it prints the maximum balance `ans` for each test case.

The logic is correct because:
- It considers all possible divisors of `x` which could be the GCD of the sub-problems.
- It checks if the number of sub-problems `n` can be achieved with the current divisor `i` or its complement `x // i`.
- The GCD of the difficulties of the sub-problems will be maximized by choosing the largest possible divisor that satisfies the conditions.

Let's verify the example cases provided in the problem description:
1. For `x = 10` and `n = 3`, the divisors are `1, 2, 5, 10`. The valid divisors that satisfy `n <= x // i` or `n <= i` are `2` and `5`. The maximum of these is `2`.
2. For `x = 5` and `n = 5`, the only valid divisor is `1` because `n = 5` and `x // 1 = 5`. So, the maximum balance is `1`.
3. For `x = 420` and `n = 69`, the divisors are `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420`. The valid divisors that satisfy `n <= x // i` or `n <= i` are `6, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420`. The maximum of these is `6`.

In all these cases, the program correctly computes the maximum balance. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case based on the provided logic and examples.
