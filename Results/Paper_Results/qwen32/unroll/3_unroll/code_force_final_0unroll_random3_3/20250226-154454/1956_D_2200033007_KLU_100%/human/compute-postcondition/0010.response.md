Postcondition: **`i` is a non-negative integer representing the current step in the process of making stairs in the array `arr`, starting from the index `start_index`; `is_already_stairs` is `False` indicating that at least one `arr[start_index + j]` was not equal to `j` for `j` in `range(i + 1)`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0.**
