You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Input

    0

Output

    1 1
    1 1
    
Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `make_stairs` modifies the array `arr` by setting a sequence of elements starting from `start_index` to a specific pattern based on the value of `i`. It also appends tuples to the list `res` indicating the range of indices modified. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are the key problems:

1. **Incomplete Implementation of `make_stairs` Function**:
   - The `make_stairs` function is called with an argument `i` but does not use the `start_index` variable, which is defined in `func_2`. This leads to incorrect array manipulation and incorrect results.
   - The `make_stairs` function modifies the array `arr` directly, but it does not ensure that the array is correctly transformed into a staircase pattern as intended.

2. **Incorrect Use of `res_dict`**:
   - The `res_dict` dictionary is used for memoization in `func_1` but is not defined anywhere in the provided code. This will result in a `NameError` when the function is called.
   - The `res_dict` should be initialized before using it in `func_1`.

3. **Global Variables**:
   - The code uses global variables like `arr`, `res_dict`, and `res` without defining them within the functions or passing them as parameters. This is bad practice and can lead to undefined behavior.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where the array is already in an optimal state or where the array has only one element correctly. For example, if the array is already a staircase pattern, the code may still perform unnecessary operations.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The code does not print the output in the required format. It should print the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves.

6. **Logic Errors**:
   - The logic for determining the maximum sum and the sequence of operations is not fully correct. The recursive approach in `func_1` and `func_2` may not cover all possible cases and may not always produce the optimal solution.

Here is a specific example where the code does not work correctly:

**Example Input:**
```
3
1 3 9
```

**Expected Output:**
```
13 0
```

**Actual Output:**
- The code will likely fail due to the issues mentioned above, and it may not produce the correct output.

Given these issues, the code is not correct for all potential cases, and therefore, the correctness is **False**.
