### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its functions to determine if they correctly solve the problem.

#### Problem Breakdown:
- The goal is to maximize the sum of the array `arr` by performing operations where a subarray is replaced with its MEX value.
- The MEX (minimum excluded value) of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.
- The operations can be performed no more than 5 * 10^5 times, but the problem guarantees that the maximum sum can be achieved within this limit.
- The output should include the maximum sum and the sequence of operations that achieve this sum.

#### Functions Analysis:

1. **`func_1(start_index, end_index)`**:
   - This function calculates the maximum possible sum of the subarray `arr[start_index:end_index + 1]` after performing the allowed operations.
   - It uses memoization to store results of subproblems in `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The function considers three main cases:
     - The subarray is a single element.
     - The subarray can be split into two parts, and the maximum sum is calculated by considering the MEX of the split parts.
     - The maximum sum is achieved by including the first or last element of the subarray and recursively solving the remaining subarray.
   - The function returns the maximum sum for the subarray defined by `start_index` and `end_index`.

2. **`func_2(start_index, end_index)`**:
   - This function generates the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`.
   - It recursively determines the optimal operations by comparing the results of `func_1` for different subarrays.
   - If the maximum sum is achieved by setting the entire subarray to its MEX, it calls `make_stairs` to generate the necessary operations.
   - Otherwise, it splits the subarray and combines the operations from the subranges.

3. **`make_stairs(i)`**:
   - This function modifies the array `arr` to create a "staircase" pattern from `start_index` to `start_index + i`.
   - It checks if the subarray is already in the desired pattern and, if not, performs the necessary operations to achieve it.
   - The operations are stored in the list `res`.

#### Correctness Verification:

- **`func_1`** correctly calculates the maximum possible sum for any subarray using dynamic programming with memoization.
- **`func_2`** correctly generates the sequence of operations by leveraging the results from `func_1` and recursively determining the optimal splits.
- **`make_stairs`** correctly modifies the array to achieve the desired "staircase" pattern, which is necessary for maximizing the sum when the entire subarray is set to its MEX.

#### Conclusion:
The provided functions together correctly solve the problem by maximizing the sum of the array and generating the necessary operations. The use of memoization ensures efficient computation, and the recursive approach ensures that the optimal solution is found.

### Correctness: **True**
