The function `func_1` calculates and returns the maximum value based on the subarray defined by `start_index` and `end_index` in the array `arr`. It uses memoization with the dictionary `res_dict` to store and retrieve previously computed results for subarrays. The function handles three main cases: returning a cached result, returning the maximum of 1 and the single element in the subarray when `start_index` equals `end_index`, and computing the maximum value by considering different splits of the subarray and recursively calling itself.
