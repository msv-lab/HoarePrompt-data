Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) that maximizes the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

### Key Observations:
1. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.
2. The value of \( y \) should be chosen such that \( \gcd(x, y) \) is maximized and \( y \) is as large as possible, given the constraint \( y < x \).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program simply sets \( y \) to \( x // 2 \) for each test case and prints it. Let's evaluate if this approach always yields the maximum value for \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

1. **Choosing \( y = x // 2 \):**
   - When \( y = x // 2 \), \( y \) is the largest integer less than \( x \) that is a divisor of \( x \) if \( x \) is even.
   - However, if \( x \) is odd, \( x // 2 \) is not a divisor of \( x \), and the GCD will be smaller.
   - For example, if \( x = 7 \), \( y = 3 \) (since \( 7 // 2 = 3 \)), and \( \gcd(7, 3) = 1 \), so \( \gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 4 \).
   - But, the correct answer for \( x = 7 \) should be \( y = 6 \) because \( \gcd(7, 6) = 1 \), and \( \gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 7 \), which is the maximum possible value.

2. **General Case:**
   - The program does not consider other potential values of \( y \) that might yield a higher \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
   - For example, if \( x = 21 \), the program would output \( y = 10 \), but the correct answer is \( y = 18 \) because \( \gcd(21, 18) = 3 \), and \( \gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 21 \).

### Conclusion:
The program does not always provide the correct \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). It only considers \( y = x // 2 \), which is not guaranteed to be optimal in all cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
