Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always find the integer \( y \) (1 \le \( y \) < \( x \)) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized. The program simply returns \( x // 2 \) for each test case, which does not guarantee the maximum value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

Let's consider a counterexample:

For \( x = 10 \):
- The program returns \( y = 10 // 2 = 5 \).
- \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\).

However, another possible \( y \) is 9:
- \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\).

In this case, both \( y = 5 \) and \( y = 9 \) give the same maximum value, but let's consider another example where the difference is more apparent:

For \( x = 21 \):
- The program returns \( y = 21 // 2 = 10 \).
- \(\gcd(21, 10) + 10 = 1 + 10 = 11\).

However, another possible \( y \) is 18:
- \(\gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 3 + 18 = 21\).

Here, \( y = 18 \) gives a higher value than \( y = 10 \). Therefore, the program does not always find the correct \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
