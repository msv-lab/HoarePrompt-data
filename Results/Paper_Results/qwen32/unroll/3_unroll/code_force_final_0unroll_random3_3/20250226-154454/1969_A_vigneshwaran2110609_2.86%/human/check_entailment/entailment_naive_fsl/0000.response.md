Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. The code checks if `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` to determine if any two friends can come to the party, but this condition does not correctly identify pairs of friends who are each other's best friends.
2. The code prints `2` when the condition is met, but it does not handle cases where no such pair exists and more invitations are needed.
3. The code always prints `3` when no pair is found, which is not always the correct answer. For example, if all friends can be paired such that each friend is the best friend of another, the answer should be `2`, not `3`.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:
Input:
```
1
4
2 3 4 1
```
Expected Output:
```
2
```
Explanation:
Monocarp can invite friends 1 and 2. Friend 1's best friend is 2, and friend 2's best friend is 3, but since friend 2 is invited, friend 1 will come. Similarly, friend 2 will come because friend 1 is invited. Thus, only 2 invitations are needed.

However, the provided code will print `3` for this input, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all cases as per the problem description, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
