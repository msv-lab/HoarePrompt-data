Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers where each integer `p_i` is between 1 and `n` and `p_i` is not equal to `i`. The function returns the number of swaps required to sort the list `p` in ascending order using a specific swapping rule.**
