The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a` are related to the test cases inside the loop and do not affect whether the loop can execute or not.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The value of `i` before the loop starts is not relevant because it is initialized by the `range(t)` function in the loop head.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is not relevant before the loop starts**
