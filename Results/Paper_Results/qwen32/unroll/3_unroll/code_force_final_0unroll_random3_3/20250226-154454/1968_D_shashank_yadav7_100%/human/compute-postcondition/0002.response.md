Output State: **For each of the `t` test cases, the program will print either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the comparison of the maximum accumulated values `bm` and `sm` after processing the loop. The state of variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a` remains unchanged outside the context of the loop execution for each test case.**
