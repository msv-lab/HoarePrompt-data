t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four integers (n, k, P_B, P_S) such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^9, followed by a list p of n integers (1 <= p_i <= n) representing the permutation, and a list a of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) representing the array a. The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
