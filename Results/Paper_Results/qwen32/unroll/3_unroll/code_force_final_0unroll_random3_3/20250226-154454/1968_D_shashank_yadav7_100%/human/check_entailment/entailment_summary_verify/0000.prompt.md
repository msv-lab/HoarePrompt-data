You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

            sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
            sp += a[s]
            bp += a[b]
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:

        else:
            print('Draw')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, and lists `p` and `a`. For each test case, it calculates the maximum accumulated values for two entities, 'Bodya' and 'Sasha', and prints the name of the entity with the higher accumulated value, or 'Draw' if they are equal.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly implements the solution as per the problem description.

### Analysis of the Program

The program is supposed to simulate the "Permutation game" between Bodya and Sasha for `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads the following:
- `n`: length of the permutation
- `k`: number of turns
- `P_B`: Bodya's starting position
- `P_S`: Sasha's starting position
- `p`: permutation array
- `a`: array of scores

The program then calculates the scores for both players after `k` turns and determines the winner.

### Key Points to Check:
1. **Initialization**: The starting positions are decremented by 1 to convert them from 1-based to 0-based indexing.
2. **Score Calculation**: The initial scores are set based on the starting positions.
3. **Simulation of Moves**: The program simulates `k` turns, updating the positions and scores for both players.
4. **Comparison of Scores**: After `k` turns, the program compares the scores and prints the winner or "Draw" if the scores are equal.

### Potential Issues to Look For:
- **Correctness of Position Updates**: The program should correctly update the positions based on the permutation array.
- **Correctness of Score Updates**: The program should correctly accumulate the scores based on the current positions.
- **Handling of Large `k`**: The program should handle the case where `k` is very large efficiently.
- **Edge Cases**: Consider edge cases such as `k=1`, `P_B = P_S`, etc.

### Code Review:
- **Initialization**: `b -= 1` and `s -= 1` correctly convert the starting positions to 0-based indexing.
- **Score Calculation**: `bp` and `sp` are initialized with the scores at the starting positions.
- **Simulation of Moves**: The loop runs `k` times, updating the positions and scores:
  - `b = p[b] - 1` and `s = p[s] - 1` correctly update the positions.
  - `bp += a[b]` and `sp += a[s]` correctly accumulate the scores.
- **Comparison of Scores**: The final comparison is correct and prints the appropriate result.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **`k=1`**: The program correctly handles this case by only performing one iteration.
- **`P_B = P_S`**: If both start at the same position, the scores will be compared correctly after `k` turns.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. It handles the updates of positions and scores correctly and efficiently, even for large values of `k`. The edge cases considered also seem to be handled appropriately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases.
