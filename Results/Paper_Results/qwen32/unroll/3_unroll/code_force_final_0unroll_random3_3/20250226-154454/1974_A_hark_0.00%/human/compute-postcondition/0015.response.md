Postcondition: **`x` and `y` are integers where 0 <= `x` <= 99 and 0 <= `y` <= 99. At least one of `x` or `y` is 0. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the conditions remain the same. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the conditions remain the same. Otherwise, it is not the case that both `x` and `y` are greater than 0.**
