You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if a < b else b

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` processes a number of test cases specified by the user input `t` (where `1 <= t <= 10^4`). For each test case, it calls `func_2` to perform some unspecified processing. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return a value; instead, it outputs results based on the processing of each test case.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Recap:
- Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means it has 15 cells.
- We need to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons on the minimum number of screens.
- A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
- A 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.

### Analysis of the Program:
The provided program consists of three functions:
1. **func_1(a, b)**: This function returns the minimum of `a` and `b`. However, this function is not used anywhere in the program, so it is redundant.
2. **func_2()**: This function handles the logic for each test case.
3. **func_3()**: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_2()` for each test case.

Let's analyze `func_2()` in detail:
- It reads `x` and `y` values from the input.
- It then proceeds with different branches based on the values of `x` and `y`:
  - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it calculates the minimum screens required for `y` 2x2 icons (`bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`). It then adjusts the remaining cells needed for `x` 1x1 icons and calculates the additional screens required (`bxsfory1`). Finally, it prints the sum of the screens needed for `y` 2x2 icons and the screens needed for the remaining `x` 1x1 icons.
  - If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, it simply prints the number of screens required for `y` 2x2 icons.
  - If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, it prints the number of screens required for `x` 1x1 icons.
  - If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0.

### Issues and Corrections:
The logic in `func_2()` is incorrect for several reasons:
1. The calculation of `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. It should correctly account for the number of 2x2 icons placed and then calculate the remaining cells for 1x1 icons.
2. The logic for calculating `bxsfory1` is incorrect. It should calculate the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons and then determine the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
3. The program does not correctly handle the placement of 2x2 icons in a way that maximizes the use of the screen space.

### Correct Approach:
1. Place as many 2x2 icons as possible. Each 2x2 icon uses 4 cells.
2. Calculate the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.
3. Place 1x1 icons in the remaining cells.
4. Calculate the total number of screens required.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of `func_2()`:
```python
import math

def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    screens_for_y = math.ceil(y / 2)
    remaining_cells = 15 * screens_for_y - y * 4
    remaining_x = x - remaining_cells
    if remaining_x > 0:
        screens_for_x = math.ceil(remaining_x / 15)
    else:
        screens_for_x = 0
    print(screens_for_y + screens_for_x)

def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in `func_2()`. The corrected program is provided above.
