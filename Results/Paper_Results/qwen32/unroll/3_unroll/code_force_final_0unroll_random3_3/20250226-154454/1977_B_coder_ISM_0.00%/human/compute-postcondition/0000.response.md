Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x < 2^30.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to the integer value provided by the input. The constraints on `t` remain the same, and the information about `x` for each test case is still valid as it has not been modified by the provided code snippet.
