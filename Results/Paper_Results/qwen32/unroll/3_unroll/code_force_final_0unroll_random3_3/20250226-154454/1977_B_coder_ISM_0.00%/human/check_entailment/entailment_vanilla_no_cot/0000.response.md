Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to generate an array `a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}` that meets all the specified conditions. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Binary Representation**: The program initially converts the number `x` into a binary string. However, this binary representation does not consider the possibility of using `-1` in the array, which is critical to solving the problem.

2. **Condition Handling**: The program attempts to handle the condition that no two consecutive elements in the array can be non-zero, but it does so incorrectly. It tries to flip values and insert `-1` without a clear and correct strategy.

3. **Output Format**: The program outputs the array in a way that does not match the expected format. It should print the length of the array first, followed by the array itself.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program doesn't handle edge cases correctly, such as when `x` is a power of 2 or when `x` requires the use of `-1` to meet the conditions.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        a = []
        i = 0
        while x > 0:
            if x & 1:
                if i > 0 and a[-1] != 0:
                    a[-1] = -a[-1]
                    x += 2 ** i
                a.append(1)
            else:
                a.append(0)
            x >>= 1
            i += 1
        n = len(a)
        print(n)
        print(*a)

func()
```

This corrected version constructs the array by iterating through the bits of `x` and ensuring that the condition of no two consecutive non-zero elements is met by adjusting the array as necessary.
