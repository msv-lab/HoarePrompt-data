Reasoning: 

The provided program attempts to convert a given integer `x` into a binary-like representation using the digits 1, 0, and -1, with the additional constraint that no two non-zero digits can be adjacent. However, there are several issues with the program that make it incorrect based on the problem description and the provided example outputs.

1. **Binary Conversion**: The program first converts the integer `x` into its binary representation using the digits 1 and 0. This part is correct, but it doesn't account for the possibility of using -1 in the representation.

2. **Transformation Logic**: The logic for transforming the binary string to include -1 while ensuring no two non-zero digits are adjacent is flawed. The program tries to adjust the binary string by replacing consecutive 1s with a -1 followed by a 1, but it doesn't handle all cases correctly. For example, it doesn't correctly handle scenarios where multiple 1s are adjacent or when the transformation affects the length of the array.

3. **Output Formatting**: The program prints the array before and after the transformation, but it doesn't correctly format the output as specified. The length of the array and the array itself need to be printed on separate lines for each test case. The current implementation prints the array before the transformation and then the length and modified array, which is incorrect.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program doesn't handle edge cases correctly, such as when `x` is a power of 2 or when `x` requires the maximum length of 32.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The output does not match the expected format or the constraints provided in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
