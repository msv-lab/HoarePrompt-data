Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the constraints and requirements specified in the problem description. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Array Construction**:
   - The program initializes the array `s` by converting the binary representation of `x` into a list of '1's and '0's. This is incorrect because the problem description specifies that the array elements can be 1, 0, or -1, and that no two consecutive elements can be non-zero.
   - The program then attempts to modify the array to meet the constraints, but it does so in a way that does not guarantee correctness for all possible values of `x`.

2. **Handling Consecutive Non-Zero Elements**:
   - The program tries to replace consecutive '1's with '-1' and '0' to ensure no two consecutive elements are non-zero. However, this logic is flawed and does not always produce a valid array for all values of `x`.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs the length of the array and the array itself, but the array elements are not correctly adjusted to meet the problem constraints.

To illustrate the issue, consider the test case `x = 15`. The binary representation of 15 is `1111`, and the program might incorrectly handle this by converting it to an array of '1's and then attempting to adjust it. However, a valid array for `x = 15` should be `[-1, 0, -1, 0, 1]`, which satisfies all the conditions.

Here is an example of how the program might fail for `x = 15`:

- The initial array `s` would be `['1', '1', '1', '1']`.
- The program then attempts to adjust this array to avoid consecutive non-zero elements, but it might not produce a valid array like `[-1, 0, -1, 0, 1]`.

Thus, the program does not correctly generate the required array for all possible values of `x`, and therefore, it is incorrect.
