t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5) and a list of integers a of length n (0 ≤ a_i < n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid string s exists that corresponds to the given trace.
