The code snippet provided only reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means that `n` will take the value of the input provided. The initial state mentions that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and this precondition will still hold after the input is read. The other variables `t` and `p` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n], and all p_i are distinct.**
