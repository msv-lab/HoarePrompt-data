To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, we need to break down the code and understand how the variables and expressions are evaluated based on the initial state provided.

### Code Breakdown
The code snippet is as follows:
```python
print('\n'.join([str(sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in
    enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
```

### Initial State
- `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- For each test case, there are four integers `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4` (0 ≤ p1, p2, p3, p4 ≤ 200) representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, the code reads four integers `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4` from the input.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The `enumerate(map(int, input().split()))` part reads the four integers and pairs them with their respective indices (0 for `p1`, 1 for `p2`, 2 for `p3`, and 3 for `p4`).

3. **Calculating the Expression:**
   - For each of the four integers `x` (which are `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4`), the expression `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)` is calculated.
     - `x // 2` gives the number of complete pairs of `x` (each pair contributes 3 to the sum).
     - `x % 2` gives the remainder when `x` is divided by 2 (if there's an extra element, it contributes 1 to the sum if `i < 3`).
     - `i < 3` is a condition that checks if the current index is less than 3 (which means it's either `p1`, `p2`, or `p3`).

4. **Summing Up the Values:**
   - The results of the above expression for each `x` are summed up.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - The sum is then divided by 3 using integer division (`// 3`).

6. **Output:**
   - The result of the final calculation is converted to a string and added to a list.
   - After processing all test cases, the list of results is joined with newline characters (`\n`) and printed.

### Example Calculation
Let's consider an example to understand the calculation better:
- Suppose the input is:
  ```
  1
  3 2 1 0
  ```
- For the first test case:
  - `p1 = 3`, `p2 = 2`, `p3 = 1`, `p4 = 0`
  - Calculation for each `x`:
    - For `p1` (i=0, x=3): `3 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * (0 < 3) = 3 * 1 + 1 * 1 = 4`
    - For `p2` (i=1, x=2): `3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (1 < 3) = 3 * 1 + 0 * 1 = 3`
    - For `p3` (i=2, x=1): `3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (2 < 3) = 3 * 0 + 1 * 1 = 1`
    - For `p4` (i=3, x=0): `3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * (3 < 3) = 3 * 0 + 0 * 0 = 0`
  - Sum of these values: `4 + 3 + 1 + 0 = 8`
  - Final result after integer division by 3: `8 // 3 = 2`

### Final Output
Given the above example, the output would be:
Output: **2**

However, since the exact inputs are not provided, the output will be a series of results for each test case, each on a new line.

### General Output Format
Output: **result1\nresult2\n...\nresultt (where each resulti is the calculated value for the i-th test case)**

Since the exact inputs are not provided, the output will be in the form of the results for each test case, each separated by a newline character.
