Output State: **The output state consists of t lines of output for each test case string s. For each string, the output will be either 'NO' or 'YES' followed by additional information. If 'YES', it will specify the minimum number of splits needed (1 or 2) and the resulting substrings after the split. The value of t and the strings s remain unchanged from the initial state.**
