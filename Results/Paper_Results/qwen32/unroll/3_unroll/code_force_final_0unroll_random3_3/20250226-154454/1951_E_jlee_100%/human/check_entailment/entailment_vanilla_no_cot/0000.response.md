Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for partitioning a string into substrings that are not palindromes. Specifically, it fails to correctly identify and partition strings that can be split into more than two non-palindrome substrings. Let's analyze the issues and provide a corrected approach.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Handling Strings with Repeated Characters:**
   - The program incorrectly handles strings where the first and last characters are the same but the string is not a palindrome (e.g., "abacaba"). It assumes that if the first and last characters are the same and the string is not entirely made up of that character, it must be a palindrome, which is not necessarily true.
   
2. **Partitioning Logic:**
   - The program's logic for partitioning the string into more than two parts is flawed. It does not correctly identify valid partitions that can be formed by splitting the string into multiple non-palindrome substrings.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if the string can be partitioned into one or more non-palindrome substrings. Here's a corrected approach:

1. **Single Character Strings:**
   - If the string has only one character, it is a palindrome, so the answer is "NO".

2. **Check for Non-Palindrome Substrings:**
   - If the entire string is not a palindrome, then it can be partitioned into one substring (the entire string), and the answer is "YES".
   - If the entire string is a palindrome, try to find a valid partition by splitting the string into two or more non-palindrome substrings.

3. **Partitioning Strategy:**
   - Iterate through the string to find the first and last positions where the characters differ from the first character.
   - Use these positions to form the first and last substrings, ensuring they are not palindromes.
   - If the remaining middle part is also a palindrome, further split it into non-palindrome substrings.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        if not is_palindrome(s):
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(s)
            continue
        # Try to find a valid partition
        found = False
        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            if not is_palindrome(s[:i]):
                for j in range(i + 1, len(s) + 1):
                    if not is_palindrome(s[i:j]) and not is_palindrome(s[j:]):
                        print('YES')
                        print(3)
                        print(s[:i], s[i:j], s[j:])
                        found = True
                        break
                if found:
                    break
        if not found:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that we correctly identify and partition strings into non-palindrome substrings when possible.
