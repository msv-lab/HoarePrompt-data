Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Let's analyze why the code is incorrect with an example.

The function `func_1` is supposed to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. However, the current implementation does not achieve this goal.

### Issue with the Code:
1. **Incorrect Bitwise OR Maximization**: The code attempts to set each element of the array to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` which is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k`. This strategy does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the entire sequence.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Sum**: After setting the first `n-1` elements, the code adds the remaining sum `k` to the last element. This does not take into account the goal of maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

### Example to Demonstrate the Issue:
Consider the test case `n = 2` and `k = 3`.

- The correct output could be `1 2` because `1 | 2 = 3` and `3` in binary is `11`, which has 2 ones.
- However, the current code will set the first element to `(1 << 3.bit_length() - 1) - 1 = (1 << 2) - 1 = 3` and the second element to `3 - 3 = 0`. Thus, the output will be `3 0` and `3 | 0 = 3` which is correct in terms of sum but not optimal for maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR, you should distribute the sum `k` in such a way that the binary representation of the resulting sequence has the maximum number of 1s. One way to achieve this is to use the highest possible powers of 2 that sum up to `k`.

### Conclusion:
The current implementation does not guarantee the maximum number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
