In the given task, the for loop iterates over the range of `n`, which is one of the variables in the loop head. To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variable `n` because `i` is the loop variable that gets assigned values from the range function during each iteration and does not need to be pre-initialized.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `n`**: This variable determines how many times the loop will execute. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.
2. **Variable `i`**: This is the loop variable and does not need to be initialized before the loop starts. It will take values from 0 to `n-1` during each iteration of the loop.
3. **Variables `t`, `k`, and `nums`**: These are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. They are part of the program state but do not influence whether the loop starts or not.

Given the constraints, `n` is already stated to be in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, which means `n` is always greater than 0, ensuring the loop will execute at least once.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute based on the loop head variables. The state remains as provided.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of `n` zeros**
