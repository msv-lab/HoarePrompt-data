Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic for determining the prices and the number of stalls is flawed, and it does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. Here are some issues with the code:

1. The logic for calculating the prices (`Min` and `Max`) and the number of jewels Alice buys at each stall is incorrect. It does not ensure that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.
2. The condition `if Max == k and n * Min <= k` is not correctly implemented to handle the scenario where Alice buys jewels.
3. The decrement of `n` (`n -= Min * Max`) is incorrect. It should be based on the number of jewels bought at each stall multiplied by the price per jewel.
4. The loop condition `(n != 0 and k > 0 and (rep < 60) and (n >= k))` is not correctly handling all edge cases.
5. The program does not handle the scenario where it is impossible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        if k > n:
            print("NO")
            continue
        prices = []
        remaining = k
        for i in range(60):
            if remaining == 0:
                break
            price = 2 ** i
            if price > n:
                break
            count = min(remaining, n // price)
            prices.append(price)
            remaining -= count
            n -= count * price
        if remaining == 0:
            print("YES")
            print(len(prices))
            print(" ".join(map(str, prices)))
        else:
            print("NO")

func()
```

In this corrected version:
- We use powers of 2 as prices to maximize the number of stalls while ensuring that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
- We iterate up to 60 times, which is the maximum number of stalls allowed.
- We check if the remaining number of jewels to be bought is zero after each iteration.
- If we can't buy the remaining jewels with the current price, we move to the next price.
- If we successfully buy all `k` jewels, we print the prices; otherwise, we print "NO".
