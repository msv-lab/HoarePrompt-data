Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not generate a k-level permutation as described in the problem statement. The approach taken in the code is to alternate between the smallest and largest remaining numbers, which does not necessarily ensure that the sums of any k-length subarrays differ by no more than 1.

To construct a k-level permutation, a more strategic approach is required. One possible method is to interleave the smallest and largest numbers in a way that balances the sums of the k-length subarrays. Here is a corrected version of the program that should work:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        answer = []
        left = 1
        right = n
        toggle = True
        
        while left <= right:
            if toggle:
                for i in range(k // 2):
                    if left <= right:
                        answer.append(left)
                        left += 1
                for i in range(k // 2):
                    if left <= right:
                        answer.append(right)
                        right -= 1
            else:
                for i in range(k // 2):
                    if left <= right:
                        answer.append(right)
                        right -= 1
                for i in range(k // 2):
                    if left <= right:
                        answer.append(left)
                        left += 1
            toggle = not toggle
        
        print(*answer)

func()
```

This version of the program alternates between adding the smallest and largest numbers in a balanced way to ensure that the sums of any k-length subarrays differ by no more than 1.
