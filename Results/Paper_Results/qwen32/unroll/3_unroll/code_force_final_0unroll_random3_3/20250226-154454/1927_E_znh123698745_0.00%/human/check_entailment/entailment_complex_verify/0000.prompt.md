You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

    #State: For each test case, the output is a line containing the `answer` array constructed by alternating between picking elements from the start and end of the `array` initialized with integers from 1 to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it constructs and prints an array of size `n` by alternating between picking elements from the start and end of an initially sequential array from 1 to `n`. The value of `k` is provided but not used in the current implementation.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to construct a k-level permutation of length n.
- A permutation is k-level if, among all the sums of continuous segments of length k, any two sums differ by no more than 1.
- The program should handle multiple test cases.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program constructs a permutation by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining numbers. Here is the program for reference:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        array = list(range(1, n + 1))
        answer = [1]
        a = [1, -1]
        for i in range(1, n):
            if (-1) ** i == -1:
                answer.append(array[a[-1]])
                a[-1] -= 1
            else:
                answer.append(array[a[0]])
                a[0] += 1
        print(*answer)
```

#### Key Points:
1. **Initialization**: The permutation starts with the smallest number (1).
2. **Alternating Selection**: The program alternates between the smallest and largest remaining numbers.
   - For odd indices, it selects the largest remaining number.
   - For even indices, it selects the smallest remaining number.
3. **Output**: The constructed permutation is printed for each test case.

### Testing the Program:
We need to verify if the constructed permutation meets the k-level condition for all possible inputs.

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `n = 2, k = 2`
- Output: `2 1`
- Sums of segments of length k: `[2 + 1] = [3]`
- Condition: `max(s) - min(s) = 3 - 3 = 0 <= 1` (Satisfied)

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `n = 3, k = 2`
- Output: `1 3 2`
- Sums of segments of length k: `[1 + 3, 3 + 2] = [4, 5]`
- Condition: `max(s) - min(s) = 5 - 4 = 1 <= 1` (Satisfied)

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `n = 10, k = 4`
- Output: `1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6`
- Sums of segments of length k: `[1+8+4+10, 8+4+10+2, 4+10+2+7, 10+2+7+5, 2+7+5+9, 7+5+9+3, 5+9+3+6] = [23, 24, 23, 24, 23, 24, 23]`
- Condition: `max(s) - min(s) = 24 - 23 = 1 <= 1` (Satisfied)

#### Test Case 4:
- Input: `n = 13, k = 4`
- Output: `4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7`
- Sums of segments of length k: `[4+10+1+13, 10+1+13+5, 1+13+5+9, 13+5+9+2, 5+9+2+12, 9+2+12+6, 2+12+6+8, 12+6+8+3, 6+8+3+11, 8+3+11+7] = [38, 29, 28, 29, 26, 29, 28, 29, 28, 29]`
- Condition: `max(s) - min(s) = 29 - 26 = 3 > 1` (Not Satisfied)

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the case where `n = 13` and `k = 4` as the sums of segments of length k do not satisfy the k-level condition.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The program alternates between the smallest and largest remaining numbers, but this approach does not guarantee that the sums of all segments of length k will differ by no more than 1. The provided test case shows that the sums can differ by more than 1, thus violating the k-level condition.
