To understand the output state, we need to break down the given loop and see how the array `answer` is constructed for each test case. 

The provided code processes each test case individually. For each test case, it initializes an array `array` with integers from 1 to `n`. It then constructs the `answer` array by alternating between picking elements from the start and end of the `array`. Specifically:
- For odd indices in `answer`, it picks an element from the end of `array` and moves the end pointer leftwards.
- For even indices in `answer`, it picks an element from the start of `array` and moves the start pointer rightwards.

Let's analyze a few examples to understand the pattern:

1. **Example with n=4, k=2:**
   - `array` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - `answer` starts with `[1]`.
   - For `i=1` (odd), `answer` becomes `[1, 4]` (pick from the end).
   - For `i=2` (even), `answer` becomes `[1, 4, 2]` (pick from the start).
   - For `i=3` (odd), `answer` becomes `[1, 4, 2, 3]` (pick from the end).
   - Final `answer` is `[1, 4, 2, 3]`.

2. **Example with n=6, k=4:**
   - `array` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
   - `answer` starts with `[1]`.
   - For `i=1` (odd), `answer` becomes `[1, 6]` (pick from the end).
   - For `i=2` (even), `answer` becomes `[1, 6, 2]` (pick from the start).
   - For `i=3` (odd), `answer` becomes `[1, 6, 2, 5]` (pick from the end).
   - For `i=4` (even), `answer` becomes `[1, 6, 2, 5, 3]` (pick from the start).
   - For `i=5` (odd), `answer` becomes `[1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4]` (pick from the end).
   - Final `answer` is `[1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4]`.

From these examples, we can see that the `answer` array for each test case is constructed by alternating between the start and end of the `array`.

Given that the initial state of `t` test cases is provided, the output state after all executions of the loop will consist of `t` lines, each containing the `answer` array for the respective test case.

**Output State: **After processing all test cases, the output will be `t` lines, each line containing the `answer` array constructed as described above for the respective test case. The state of `t`, `n`, and `k` for each test case remains as per the input.**

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` for each test case are not provided, we cannot specify the exact numerical output. However, we can describe the format and construction of the output.

Output State: **For each test case, the output is a line containing the `answer` array constructed by alternating between picking elements from the start and end of the `array` initialized with integers from 1 to `n`.**
