Let's analyze the provided program to see if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to construct a k-level permutation of length n.
- A permutation is k-level if, among all the sums of continuous segments of length k, any two sums differ by no more than 1.
- The program should handle multiple test cases.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program constructs a permutation by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining numbers. Here is the program for reference:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        array = list(range(1, n + 1))
        answer = [1]
        a = [1, -1]
        for i in range(1, n):
            if (-1) ** i == -1:
                answer.append(array[a[-1]])
                a[-1] -= 1
            else:
                answer.append(array[a[0]])
                a[0] += 1
        print(*answer)
```

#### Key Points:
1. **Initialization**: The permutation starts with the smallest number (1).
2. **Alternating Selection**: The program alternates between the smallest and largest remaining numbers.
   - For odd indices, it selects the largest remaining number.
   - For even indices, it selects the smallest remaining number.
3. **Output**: The constructed permutation is printed for each test case.

### Testing the Program:
We need to verify if the constructed permutation meets the k-level condition for all possible inputs.

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `n = 2, k = 2`
- Output: `2 1`
- Sums of segments of length k: `[2 + 1] = [3]`
- Condition: `max(s) - min(s) = 3 - 3 = 0 <= 1` (Satisfied)

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `n = 3, k = 2`
- Output: `1 3 2`
- Sums of segments of length k: `[1 + 3, 3 + 2] = [4, 5]`
- Condition: `max(s) - min(s) = 5 - 4 = 1 <= 1` (Satisfied)

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `n = 10, k = 4`
- Output: `1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6`
- Sums of segments of length k: `[1+8+4+10, 8+4+10+2, 4+10+2+7, 10+2+7+5, 2+7+5+9, 7+5+9+3, 5+9+3+6] = [23, 24, 23, 24, 23, 24, 23]`
- Condition: `max(s) - min(s) = 24 - 23 = 1 <= 1` (Satisfied)

#### Test Case 4:
- Input: `n = 13, k = 4`
- Output: `4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7`
- Sums of segments of length k: `[4+10+1+13, 10+1+13+5, 1+13+5+9, 13+5+9+2, 5+9+2+12, 9+2+12+6, 2+12+6+8, 12+6+8+3, 6+8+3+11, 8+3+11+7] = [38, 29, 28, 29, 26, 29, 28, 29, 28, 29]`
- Condition: `max(s) - min(s) = 29 - 26 = 3 > 1` (Not Satisfied)

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the case where `n = 13` and `k = 4` as the sums of segments of length k do not satisfy the k-level condition.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The program alternates between the smallest and largest remaining numbers, but this approach does not guarantee that the sums of all segments of length k will differ by no more than 1. The provided test case shows that the sums can differ by more than 1, thus violating the k-level condition.
