Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` representing the length of an array and a list of `n` integers `a_i` representing the elements of the array. The function returns a list `results` where each element corresponds to the number of operations required for each test case.**
