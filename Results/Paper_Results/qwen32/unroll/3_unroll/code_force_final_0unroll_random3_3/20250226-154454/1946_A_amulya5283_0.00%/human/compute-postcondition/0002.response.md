Let's break down the code to understand how the state evolves with each iteration of the loop:

1. **Initialization**: The initial state includes a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, a list of tuples `test_cases` where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, and an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each test case:
     - The array `arr` is sorted.
     - The median index is determined as `n // 2`.
     - The current median is set to the element at the median index.
     - A heap is created from the second half of the sorted array (including the median if `n` is odd).
     - The heap is heapified.
     - A counter `operations` is initialized to 0.
     - While the smallest element in the heap is less than or equal to the current median:
       - The smallest element is popped from the heap.
       - The smallest element is incremented by 1 and pushed back into the heap.
       - The `operations` counter is incremented.
     - The number of operations is appended to the `results` list.

3. **Output State**:
   - After all iterations, the `results` list will contain the number of operations required for each test case to make the smallest element in the heap greater than the current median.

Given the initial state and the loop's behavior, the output state will be:

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the number of operations for each test case, and `t`, `test_cases` remain unchanged.**
