### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior based on the annotations and the problem description.

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and the arrays for each test case correctly.
   - This part of the code is accurate and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - This step is necessary to correctly identify the median.
   - The code correctly implements this step.

3. **Finding the Median**:
   - The median is identified as the element at the \(\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil\) position in the sorted array.
   - For an odd-length array, this is the middle element.
   - For an even-length array, this is the element at the \(\frac{n}{2}\) position (since Python uses 0-based indexing, this is correct).
   - The code correctly identifies the median.

4. **Heap Usage**:
   - The heap is initialized with elements starting from the median position.
   - This ensures that only the relevant elements (those that could affect the median) are considered.
   - The code correctly initializes the heap with `arr[median_index:]`.

5. **Incrementing Elements**:
   - The program repeatedly pops the smallest element from the heap, increments it by 1, and pushes it back into the heap until the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median.
   - This logic is intended to ensure that the median is increased in the minimum number of operations.
   - The code correctly implements this logic using a min-heap.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations:

- **State Before Function Call**:
  - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
  - `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the array `a`.
  - The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.

- **Inside Function `func_1`**:
  - The program correctly sorts each array.
  - It correctly identifies the median index and the current median.
  - It initializes a heap with elements starting from the median index.
  - It correctly increments the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median.
  - The number of operations is counted accurately.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The use of a heap ensures that the operations are performed efficiently. The annotations confirm that the program's behavior aligns with the problem description and the intended logic.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
