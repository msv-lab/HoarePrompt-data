The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function processes each test case to determine the number of operations needed to ensure that the smallest element in the second half of the sorted array is greater than the median. It returns a list of these operation counts corresponding to each test case.
