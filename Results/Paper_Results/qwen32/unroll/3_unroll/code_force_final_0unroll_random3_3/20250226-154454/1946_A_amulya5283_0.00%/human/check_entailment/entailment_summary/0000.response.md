Let's carefully analyze the provided Python program and its behavior as described by the execution summary to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Key Points of the Problem:
1. **Median Definition**: The median of an array is the middle element in the sorted array. If the number of elements is even, the median is the element at the index \(\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil\).
2. **Task**: Increase the median of the array by the minimum number of operations, where an operation consists of incrementing any element by 1.
3. **Input**: Multiple test cases, each with an array of integers.
4. **Output**: For each test case, output the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Sorting**: The program sorts the array to find the median.
2. **Median Index**: It calculates the median index as `n // 2`.
3. **Heap Operations**: The program uses a min-heap to efficiently find and increment the smallest elements in the second half of the sorted array.
4. **Incrementing Elements**: It keeps incrementing the smallest element in the heap (which is part of the second half of the sorted array) until it becomes greater than the current median.

### Correctness Verification:
- **Sorting**: Sorting the array is necessary to correctly identify the median.
- **Heap Usage**: The heap is used to efficiently manage the smallest elements in the second half of the sorted array.
- **Incrementing Logic**: The logic of incrementing the smallest element until it exceeds the median is correct and minimizes the number of operations.

### Example Walkthrough:
Consider the first test case from the problem statement:
- **Input**: `3`, `[2, 2, 8]`
- **Sorted Array**: `[2, 2, 8]`
- **Median Index**: `3 // 2 = 1`
- **Current Median**: `2`
- **Heap**: `[2, 8]`
- **Operations**:
  - Increment the smallest element `2` in the heap to `3`: `[3, 8]`
- **New Median**: `3` (from `[2, 3, 8]`)
- **Result**: `1` operation

This matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The use of sorting and a heap ensures that the solution is both correct and efficient.

**Correctness: True**
