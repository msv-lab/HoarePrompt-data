### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array for multiple test cases. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The program first sorts the array. This is necessary because the median is defined as the middle element (or the average of the two middle elements for even-sized arrays) of the sorted array.

2. **Identifying the Median**: The median index is determined as `n // 2`. For an odd-sized array, this is the middle element. For an even-sized array, this is the lower of the two middle elements. The program correctly identifies the median value as `arr[median_index]`.

3. **Heap Construction**: The program constructs a min-heap from the elements starting from the median index. This heap is used to efficiently get and update the smallest element among the potential median candidates.

4. **Increasing the Median**: The program enters a loop where it repeatedly extracts the smallest element from the heap, increments it by 1, and pushes it back into the heap. This operation is counted as one "operation". The loop continues until the smallest element in the heap (which represents the smallest candidate for the new median) is greater than the current median.

5. **Counting Operations**: The number of operations required to increase the median is counted and stored in the `operations` variable for each test case.

6. **Result Compilation**: The results for all test cases are compiled into a list and returned.

### Verification:

- **Correctness of Median Calculation**: The program correctly identifies the median as the element at index `n // 2` in the sorted array.
- **Efficiency of Heap Operations**: Using a heap to manage the potential median candidates ensures that the smallest candidate can be efficiently retrieved and updated.
- **Counting Operations**: The program correctly counts the number of operations required to ensure that the smallest candidate for the new median is greater than the current median.
- **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program handles multiple test cases by iterating over the `test_cases` list and processing each test case independently.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It efficiently handles the constraints and provides the correct number of operations for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
