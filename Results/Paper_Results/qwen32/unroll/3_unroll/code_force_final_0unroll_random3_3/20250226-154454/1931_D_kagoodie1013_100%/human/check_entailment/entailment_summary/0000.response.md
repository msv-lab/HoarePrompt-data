### Reasoning:

The program is designed to find the number of beautiful pairs in an array based on the given conditions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and whether it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it extracts the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by the array `arr` of `n` integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the counts of pairs of residues `(num % x, num % y)`.
   - It iterates through each number `num` in the array `arr`:
     - It calculates `r_x` as `-num % x` and `r_y` as `num % y`.
     - It increments the count of beautiful pairs by the number of previous elements that have the residue pair `(r_x, r_y)`.
     - It updates the `residue_map` to include the current number's residue pair `(num % x, num % y)`.

3. **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
   - The key to counting beautiful pairs is understanding the residue conditions:
     - For `a_i + a_j` to be divisible by `x`, `(a_i % x) + (a_j % x) ≡ 0 (mod x)`, which means `(a_i % x) ≡ -a_j % x (mod x)`.
     - For `a_i - a_j` to be divisible by `y`, `(a_i % y) - (a_j % y) ≡ 0 (mod y)`, which means `(a_i % y) ≡ a_j % y (mod y)`.
   - The program correctly uses `-num % x` as the residue to find pairs that satisfy the first condition and `num % y` to find pairs that satisfy the second condition.
   - The dictionary `residue_map` keeps track of how many times each residue pair `(num % x, num % y)` has been seen, allowing the program to efficiently count the number of beautiful pairs.

4. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs based on the given conditions. It efficiently uses a dictionary to keep track of residue pairs and counts the pairs in a single pass through the array for each test case.

### Correctness: **True**
