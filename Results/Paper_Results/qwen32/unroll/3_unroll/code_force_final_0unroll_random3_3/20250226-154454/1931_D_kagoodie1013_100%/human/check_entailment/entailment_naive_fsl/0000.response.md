Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given problem description. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the input in a single read operation and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case to extract `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes a `count` variable to zero and a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of pairs of residues.
   - It iterates through each number in the array `arr`:
     - For each number `num`, it calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y`:
       - `r_x` is calculated as `-num % x`. This is equivalent to finding the residue of `-num` modulo `x`. The use of `-num % x` ensures that the residue is adjusted to be non-negative.
       - `r_y` is calculated as `num % y`.
     - It then checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` exists in `residue_map`. If it does, it adds the count of that pair to the `count` variable.
     - It updates the `residue_map` with the current pair `(num % x, num % y)`.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program outputs the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

The logic used in the program is sound and correctly identifies beautiful pairs based on the problem description. The use of residues ensures that the conditions `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y` are met. The program efficiently handles the constraints provided, and there are no obvious edge cases that it fails to address.

Since the program correctly handles the given examples and there are no apparent issues with the logic, we can conclude that the program is correct.
