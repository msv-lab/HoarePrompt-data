Let's carefully analyze the program and its annotations to verify its correctness based on the problem description. The key part to verify is whether the logic for calculating the residues and the counting of beautiful pairs is correct.

### Problem Recap
A pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) (1 \(\le\) i < j \(\le\) n) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

### Analysis of the Program
The program uses residues to efficiently count the number of beautiful pairs. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the input in one go and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case to extract `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes `count` to zero and `residue_map` to keep track of pairs of residues.
   - For each number `num` in the array `arr`:
     - It calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y`:
       - `r_x` is calculated as `-num % x`. This is meant to ensure that the residue is non-negative.
       - `r_y` is calculated as `num % y`.
     - It then checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` exists in `residue_map`. If it does, it adds the count of that pair to the `count` variable.
     - It updates the `residue_map` with the current pair `(num % x, num % y)`.

### Verification Using Annotations
The annotations confirm that the program processes each test case correctly and maintains the state of `residue_map` and `count` as expected. However, let's verify the correctness of the residue calculations:

1. **Residue Calculation:**
   - For `r_x = -num % x`, it is intended to ensure that the residue is non-negative. The correct way to achieve this would be to use `(x - num % x) % x` to ensure it is always between 0 and \(x-1\).
   - For `r_y = num % y`, this is straightforward and correct.

### Correctness of the Program
The issue arises with the calculation of `r_x`. The expression `-num % x` does not correctly compute the residue of `-num` modulo `x` in the range [0, \(x-1\)]. Instead, it can result in negative values or incorrect residues.

### Example to Illustrate the Issue
Consider `x = 5` and `num = 3`:
- `-num % x` would be `-3 % 5`, which is 2 in Python (since Python's modulo operation ensures a non-negative result).
- However, the correct residue for `-3` modulo `5` in the range [0, 4] is actually `2` (since \(-3 \equiv 2 \pmod{5}\)).

But if `num = 2`:
- `-num % x` would be `-2 % 5`, which is 3 in Python.
- The correct residue for `-2` modulo `5` in the range [0, 4] is actually `3` (since \(-2 \equiv 3 \pmod{5}\)).

However, the issue arises when `num = 0`:
- `-num % x` would be `0 % 5`, which is 0.
- This is correct, but the general formula `-num % x` is not robust for all values of `num`.

### Correct Formula
The correct formula to ensure the residue is always in the range [0, \(x-1\)] is:
\[ r_x = (x - (num \% x)) \% x \]

### Conclusion
The program is incorrect due to the incorrect residue calculation for `r_x`. The correct calculation should ensure that the residue is always non-negative and within the range [0, \(x-1\)].

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
