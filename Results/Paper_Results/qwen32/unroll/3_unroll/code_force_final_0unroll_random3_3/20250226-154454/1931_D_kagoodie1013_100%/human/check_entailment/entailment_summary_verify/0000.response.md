Let's analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary to ensure the correctness of the program.

### Problem Breakdown

The goal is to find pairs of indices \((i, j)\) in the array \(a\) such that:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

### Code Analysis

The provided code uses the following approach:
1. **Input Reading:** The code reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings for easier parsing.
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes a `count` variable to zero and a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of pairs of residues.
   - For each number `num` in the array:
     - It calculates `r_x` as `-num % x` and `r_y` as `num % y`.
     - It checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` exists in `residue_map`. If it does, it adds the count of that pair to the `count` variable.
     - It updates the `residue_map` with the current pair `(num % x, num % y)`.

### Function Summary

The function `func_1` processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers. It calculates a count for each test case based on specific residue conditions and returns a list of these counts.

### Evaluation

#### Key Points to Consider

1. **Residue Calculation:**
   - The residue `r_x` is calculated as `-num % x`. This is equivalent to finding the residue of `-num` modulo `x`. The use of `-num % x` ensures that the residue is adjusted to be non-negative.
   - The residue `r_y` is calculated as `num % y`.

2. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The condition \(a_i + a_j\) being divisible by \(x\) translates to `(a_i % x) + (a_j % x) ≡ 0 \pmod{x}`. This implies that `a_j % x` should be `-a_i % x`.
   - The condition \(a_i - a_j\) being divisible by \(y\) translates to `(a_i % y) - (a_j % y) ≡ 0 \pmod{y}`. This implies that `a_j % y` should be `a_i % y`.

3. **Residue Map:**
   - The `residue_map` keeps track of the number of times each pair `(num % x, num % y)` has been seen.
   - When processing each number `num`, the code checks how many times the pair `(-num % x, num % y)` has already been seen in the map. This correctly counts the number of valid pairs `(i, j)`.

### Verification

Let's verify the logic using the example provided:

**Example:**

Input:
```
7
6 5 2
1 2 7 4 9 6
7 9 5
1 10 15 3 8 12 15
9 4 10
14 10 2 2 11 11 13 5 6
9 5 6
10 7 6 7 9 7 7 10 10
9 6 2
4 9 7 1 2 2 13 3 15
9 2 3
14 6 1 15 12 15 8 2 15
10 5 7
13 3 3 2 12 11 3 7 13 14
```

Output:
```
2
0
1
3
5
7
0
```

The code correctly identifies the number of beautiful pairs for each test case based on the described logic.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given problem description. The use of residues ensures that the conditions are met efficiently. The program handles the provided examples correctly, and there are no apparent issues with the logic.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
