The loop head in the provided for loop statement contains the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. These are the only variables we can adjust to ensure the loop can execute. According to the code, the loop will execute if there is at least one tuple in the `test_cases` list. Therefore, we need to ensure that `test_cases` contains at least one tuple with the required structure.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n); `results` is an empty list**
