### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code to determine if it meets the problem requirements:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - **Input**: Reads a positive integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's.
    - **Process**:
        - It initializes a list `S` with a single element `[0, 0]`.
        - It iterates through the string `a` and updates the list `S` to keep track of the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's encountered so far. For example, if the string is `101`, `S` will be `[[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 2]]`.
        - It then iterates through possible positions `i` to place the road (from `0` to `n-1`).
        - For each position `i`, it calculates:
            - `left`: The number of '0's to the left of the road.
            - `lsum`: The total number of houses to the left of the road.
            - `right`: The number of '1's to the right of the road.
            - `rsum`: The total number of houses to the right of the road.
        - It checks if the number of '0's to the left meets the condition (at least half of the left side should prefer the left side) and the number of '1's to the right meets the condition (at least half of the right side should prefer the right side).
        - If both conditions are met, it updates `ans` to the current position `i` if it is closer to the middle of the village or if it is the first valid position found.
    - **Output**: Prints the position `ans` where the road should be laid.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
    - **Process**: Reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
    - **Output**: No explicit output, but `func_1` prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis:

- The code correctly calculates and checks the conditions for each possible position of the road.
- It ensures that the road is placed as close to the middle of the village as possible among all valid positions.
- It handles multiple test cases as required.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
