### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its function summary to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word such that the sum of the positions of its letters in the alphabet equals a given integer `n`.
- The letters are indexed from 1 to 26 (e.g., 'a' = 1, 'b' = 2, ..., 'z' = 26).
- The output should be the lexicographically smallest word for each test case.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `lex`.
3. It attempts to construct a list `arr` of three elements that sum to `lex`:
   - It checks if `lex` is less than or equal to 26 and appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
   - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - Otherwise, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - It appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
4. It sorts the array `arr` to ensure the smallest lexicographical order.
5. It converts each element of `arr` to the corresponding letter by adding 96 (incorrect, should be 97) and prints the result.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Values**:
   - The program incorrectly handles the values by appending 1 or 26 based on the value of `lex`. This does not guarantee the smallest lexicographical order.
   - For example, if `lex` is 24, the program might incorrectly assign values like [1, 26, -1], which is invalid.

2. **Incorrect ASCII Offset**:
   - The program uses `chr(arr[k] + 96)`, which should be `chr(arr[k] + 97)` to correctly convert from 1-based index to ASCII 'a'.

3. **Sorting the Array**:
   - Sorting the array `arr` after assigning values does not ensure the smallest lexicographical order because it does not consider the constraints of the problem properly.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, the program should:
1. Start by assigning the smallest possible value to the first letter.
2. Assign the smallest possible value to the second letter.
3. Assign the remaining value to the third letter.
4. Ensure that each letter is between 1 and 26.
5. Convert each value to the corresponding letter using the correct ASCII offset.

#### Example Fix:
Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Start with the smallest possible values for the first two letters
        first = max(1, lex - 52)  # Ensure the remaining value for the third letter is at least 1
        second = max(1, lex - first - 26)  # Ensure the remaining value for the third letter is at least 1
        third = lex - first - second
        # Ensure all values are between 1 and 26
        first = min(first, 26)
        second = min(second, 26)
        third = min(third, 26)
        # Print the result
        print(chr(first + 96), chr(second + 96), chr(third + 96), sep='')

# Example usage
# func()
```

#### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the original program is incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
