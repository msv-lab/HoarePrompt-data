Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads an integer `lex` which represents the encoded sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet. The program then tries to determine the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded to the given sum.

However, the logic in the program is flawed. The algorithm incorrectly handles the distribution of the sum across the three letters. Specifically, the program does not correctly ensure that the smallest possible letters are used first, which is necessary to achieve the lexicographically smallest word.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the issues:
1. **Incorrect Distribution Logic**: The program incorrectly uses a fixed threshold (26) to distribute the sum across the first two letters. This does not guarantee that the smallest possible letters are chosen first.
2. **Sorting the Letters**: The program sorts the letters after assigning values to them, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results if the initial assignment does not follow the lexicographical order.

A correct approach would be to start with the smallest possible letter ('a') and incrementally increase the letters while ensuring the sum matches the given encoded value.

Given the issues with the current logic, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
