To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `cases`. The loop will execute if `cases` is greater than 0.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78.
- `cases` is an input integer.

The loop will execute if `cases` is at least 1. The values of `t` and `n` do not directly affect whether the loop will execute, but they are part of the state. Since `i` is the loop variable and is initialized automatically by the `range` function, we do not need to adjust its initial state manually.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `cases` is greater than 0. We can set `cases` to 1 as the minimum value that ensures the loop will execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `cases` is at least 1, `i` is initialized by the range function**.

However, since we are only adjusting the state of objects in the loop head and `i` is automatically initialized, the final adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `cases` is at least 1**.
