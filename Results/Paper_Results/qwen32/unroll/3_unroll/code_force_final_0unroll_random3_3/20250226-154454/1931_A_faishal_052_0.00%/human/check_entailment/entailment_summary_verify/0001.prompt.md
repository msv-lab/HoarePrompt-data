You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex <= 26:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            else:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `cases` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `lex` and processes it to produce three characters as output. The output for each test case consists of three characters derived from the values in a sorted array `arr` after processing `lex`. The values of `cases` and `lex` remain unchanged after the function execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding
The task is to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word (composed of lowercase Latin letters) that sums up to a given integer `n` when the positions of the letters in the alphabet are summed. For example, "cat" would be encoded as 24 because 'c' is 3, 'a' is 1, and 't' is 20.

### Program Analysis
The provided program takes multiple test cases and for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and then attempts to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums to `n`.

Here are the steps in the program:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
3. It then tries to construct a list `arr` of three elements that sum to `n`:
   - It first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 26 and appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `n`. This logic is flawed.
   - It then checks if `n` is less than 52 and appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `n`. This logic is also flawed.
   - It appends the remaining value of `n` to `arr`.
4. It sorts the array `arr` to ensure the smallest lexicographical order.
5. It converts each element of `arr` to the corresponding letter by adding 96 (which should be 96 but the correct offset is 97 to convert from 1-based to ASCII 'a') and prints the result.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Handling of Values**:
   - The logic for handling values less than or equal to 26 and less than 52 is incorrect. It should always try to minimize the value of the first letter, then the second, and finally the third.
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where the sum of the first two letters is less than 26.
   
2. **Incorrect ASCII Offset**:
   - The program uses `chr(arr[k] + 96)`, which is incorrect. The ASCII value for 'a' is 97, not 96. It should be `chr(arr[k] + 97)`.

3. **Sorting the Array**:
   - Sorting the array `arr` after assigning values does not guarantee the smallest lexicographical order because it does not consider the constraints of the problem properly.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, we should:
1. Start by assigning the smallest possible value to the first letter.
2. Assign the smallest possible value to the second letter.
3. Assign the remaining value to the third letter.
4. Ensure that each letter is between 1 and 26.
5. Convert each value to the corresponding letter using the correct ASCII offset.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
