### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary in detail to determine its correctness.

#### Program Analysis

The program aims to find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have been encoded as a given integer `n`, where `n` is the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet.

Here is the provided program:
```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex <= 26:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            else:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
        print()
```

#### Issues in the Program

1. **Logic for Distributing the Sum**:
   - The program incorrectly handles the distribution of the sum `lex` into three parts.
   - It first tries to append `1` or `26` to the list `arr` and then appends the remaining value of `lex`.
   - This approach does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word. For example, if `lex` is 24, the program might output "aav" but it could also output "aaa" which is lexicographically smaller.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the list `arr` after distribution, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.
   - The sorting step can disrupt the order which is crucial for finding the lexicographically smallest word.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly, especially when the sum `lex` is close to the maximum possible value (78).

#### Correct Approach

To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should start with the smallest possible letters and incrementally increase them while ensuring the sum matches `lex`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Start with the smallest letters
        a = b = c = 1
        # Distribute the remaining sum
        remaining = lex - 3
        # Increment the letters in the order a, b, c
        if remaining > 0:
            a += min(remaining, 25)
            remaining -= min(remaining, 25)
            if remaining > 0:
                b += min(remaining, 25)
                remaining -= min(remaining, 25)
                if remaining > 0:
                    c += remaining
        print(chr(a + 96), chr(b + 96), chr(c + 96))

func()
```

#### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly find the lexicographically smallest word for all cases. The logic for distributing the sum and the unnecessary sorting step are the main issues.

### Final Answer
Final: **False**.

### Explanation
The provided program does not correctly distribute the sum `lex` into three parts to form the lexicographically smallest word. It incorrectly handles the distribution and sorts the parts, which can lead to incorrect results. The corrected approach ensures that the letters are incremented in the correct order to maintain the lexicographical order.
