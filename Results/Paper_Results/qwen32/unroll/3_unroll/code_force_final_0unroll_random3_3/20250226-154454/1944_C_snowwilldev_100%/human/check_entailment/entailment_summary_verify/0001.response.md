### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not correctly simulate the strategic interaction between Alice and Bob. The program's current logic simply finds the first number with a count of 1 or 0 in the array `a`, which does not consider the optimal moves by both players.

Let's break down the strategic interaction:

1. **Alice's Goal**: Maximize the MEX of the array `c`. This means she wants to include as many unique elements as possible in `c`.
2. **Bob's Goal**: Minimize the MEX of the array `c`. This means he wants to prevent Alice from including unique elements.

Given this, the optimal strategy involves considering the frequency of elements and the choices that both players make. The provided program does not account for these strategic choices.

To confirm, let's revisit the provided function summary and the logic:

- **Function Summary**: The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` and a list of `N` integers from the input. It then determines and returns the smallest integer `i` such that either the integer `i` does not appear in the list, or `i` appears exactly once in the list and there are already at least two other integers that each appear exactly once.
  
This summary does not reflect the strategic interaction between Alice and Bob. It simply finds the first integer with a count of 1 or 0, which is not the correct approach for determining the MEX under optimal play.

### Counterexample Analysis:

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation of the Correct Output:**
- Alice can pick any number, say 0.
- Bob can pick any number, say 1.
- Alice can pick the next number, say 2.
- Bob can pick the next number, say 3.
- Alice can pick the last number, 4.
- The final array `c` is `[0, 2, 4]` (or any permutation), and the MEX is 1.

The program, however, would return 0 because the count of 0 is 1, which is incorrect based on the optimal play described.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly simulate the strategic interaction between Alice and Bob and therefore does not compute the correct MEX score.

**Final: False**
