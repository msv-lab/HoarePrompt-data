The given loop iterates over each element in the list `a` and increments the count of each element in the `cnt` dictionary. After the loop completes, `cnt` will contain the frequency of each integer in the list `a`.

Since `a` is a list of `N` integers where each element is in the range `[0, N)`, `cnt` will have keys corresponding to these integers, and the values will be the number of times each integer appears in `a`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of `N` integers (0 ≤ `a_i` < `N`), `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer value `0` and contains the frequency of each integer in the list `a`.**
