The provided Python code snippet only contains the assignment `not_c = True`. This means the variable `not_c` is being set to the boolean value `True`. None of the other variables (`arr`, `set_`, `A`, or the first element of `set_`) are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by t pairs of lines where the first line of each pair contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile; `set_` is a sorted list containing unique elements from `arr`; `A` is False; the first element of `set_` is 1; `not_c` is True.**
