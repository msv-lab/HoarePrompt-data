You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by t pairs of lines where the first line of each pair contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1(arr):
    A = False
    set_ = list(set(arr))
    set_.sort()
    if (set_[0] != 1) :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns 'Alice'
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by t pairs of lines where the first line of each pair contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile; `set_` is a sorted list containing unique elements from `arr`; `A` is False; the first element of `set_` is 1.
    not_c = True
    for i in range(1, len(set_)):
        if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
            not_c = False
            break
        
        A = not A
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by t pairs of lines where the first line of each pair contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile; `set_` is a sorted list containing unique elements from `arr`; `A` is True if the number of elements in `set_` (excluding the first element) is odd, otherwise False; `not_c` is True if all elements in `set_` are consecutive, otherwise False.
    if not_c :
        A = not A
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of lines where the first line of each pair contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile; `set_` is a sorted list containing unique elements from `arr`; `A` is False if the number of elements in `set_` (excluding the first element) is odd, otherwise True; `not_c` is True if all elements in `set_` are consecutive, otherwise False. If `not_c` is True, then `A` is set to the negation of its original value.
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
    #The program returns 'Alice' if the final value of A is True, otherwise it returns 'Bob'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The first element `t` in `arr` represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the next pair of lines contains an integer `n` representing the number of piles, and the following line contains `n` integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The function returns 'Alice' if either the first condition is met (which is not explicitly described in the provided output details) or if a final value `A` is True. Otherwise, it returns 'Bob'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'Alice'

Case_2: The program returns 'Alice' if the final value of A is True, otherwise it returns 'Bob'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
