You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a permutation p of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The function can interactively query up to 3n times per test case by providing indices a, b, c, and d (0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n) to receive a comparison result of (p_a | p_b) versus (p_c | p_d). The goal is to determine any two indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized among all pairs (0 ≤ i, j < n). The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        maxi = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                maxi = i
        
        arr = [0]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                arr = [i]
            elif res == '=':
                arr.append(i)
        
        mini = arr[0]
        
        for item in arr[1:]:
            print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '>':
                mini = item
        
        print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)
        
    #State: the indices `maxi` and `mini` are printed such that `p_maxi ⊕ p_mini` is maximized.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns two indices `i` and `j` such that the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized among all pairs `(0 ≤ i, j < n)` for a given permutation `p` of the set `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`. The function can interactively query up to `3n` times per test case by providing indices `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` to receive a comparison result of `(p_a | p_b)` versus `(p_c | p_d)`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
