You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

    #State: a series of printed values, each representing the final `ans` for a test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `ans` that represents the maximum number of vertices Bessie can reach, considering the constraints and the chosen vertices. The final state of the program is a series of printed values, each corresponding to the result of a test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
- We have a regular polygon with `n` sides.
- Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices.
- We can choose up to `y` more vertices.
- The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using these vertices.

### Key Observations:
1. **Vertices and Triangles**: To form a triangle, we need 3 vertices. If we have `k` chosen vertices, the maximum number of triangles we can form is `k - 2` (this comes from the fact that each additional vertex can form a new triangle with two existing vertices).
2. **Non-Intersecting Diagonals**: The problem specifies non-intersecting diagonals, which means that the vertices should be chosen in such a way that the diagonals do not cross each other.
3. **Constraints on `y`**: The additional vertices we can choose are limited by `y`, and the problem specifies `0 <= y <= n - x`.

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the program step by step:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by the list of `x` vertices.
2. **Sorting**: The list of chosen vertices is sorted.
3. **Initial Triangle Count**: The initial count of triangles is set to `x + y - 2`.
4. **Handling Adjacent Vertices**: The program checks for gaps between consecutive vertices. If the gap is 2, it adds 1 to the triangle count. If the gap is even, it stores the half of the gap in a temporary list.
5. **Handling Circular Gaps**: The program also checks the gap between the first and the last vertex in a circular manner.
6. **Sorting Gaps**: The list of gaps is sorted.
7. **Maximizing Triangles**: The program iterates through the sorted gaps and tries to fill them by using the additional vertices (`y`). For each gap, it adds the number of triangles that can be formed and reduces `y` accordingly.
8. **Final Adjustment**: Finally, it adds any remaining `y` vertices to the triangle count and ensures the result does not exceed `n - 2`.

### Potential Issues:
- **Handling Gaps**: The program assumes that gaps can be filled optimally by using the additional vertices, but it does not consider more complex scenarios where multiple gaps might be filled simultaneously.
- **Circular Gaps**: The handling of circular gaps seems correct, but it should be double-checked.
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not explicitly handle edge cases where `y` is very small or `x` is very large.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to follow a logical approach to maximize the number of triangles, but it might not handle all edge cases optimally. Specifically, the way gaps are handled and filled might not always yield the maximum number of triangles in all scenarios.

Therefore, based on the provided analysis, the correctness of the program is questionable.

**Correctness: False**

However, it's worth noting that the program passes the provided sample cases, so it might be correct for those specific scenarios. A more rigorous analysis or additional test cases would be necessary to confirm its correctness in all possible scenarios.
