t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of x distinct integers. For each tuple, 4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), 0 <= y <= n - x, and the list of x integers are distinct and within the range [1, n]. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
