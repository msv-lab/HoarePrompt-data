You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `ans` that represents the maximum number of vertices Bessie can reach, considering the constraints and the chosen vertices. The final state of the program is a series of printed values, each corresponding to the result of a test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: Let's analyze the provided code and see if it handles all edge cases and potential scenarios as described in the problem statement.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Vertices and Diagonals**: The code attempts to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces by adding up to `y` vertices to the `x` vertices already chosen.
2. **Triangle Formation**: The code seems to be calculating potential triangles based on the gaps between chosen vertices.
3. **Edge Cases**: We need to check if the code handles edge cases such as:
   - Minimum and maximum values for `n`, `x`, and `y`.
   - Cases where all vertices are chosen (`x + y = n`).
   - Cases where no additional vertices are allowed (`y = 0`).
   - Cases where vertices are chosen such that they form a single large polygon without any triangles.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Gap Calculation**: The code calculates gaps between chosen vertices and tries to add vertices to maximize triangles. However, it seems to miss some cases where additional vertices can form more triangles.
2. **Circular Nature**: The code does not fully account for the circular nature of the polygon. For example, if vertices are chosen such that they form a large gap that can be split into multiple triangles, the code might not handle this correctly.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
6 3 2
1 3 5
```
- **Explanation**: Here, Bessie has chosen vertices 1, 3, and 5. We can add up to 2 more vertices to maximize the number of triangles.
- **Expected Output**: 5 (by choosing vertices 2 and 4, we can form 5 triangles).
- **Actual Output**: The code might output 3 or 4, depending on how it handles the gaps and additional vertices.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly, especially when it comes to maximizing the number of triangles by strategically adding vertices. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
