The only variable in the loop head is `result`. The loop will execute if `results` is a non-empty iterable. Therefore, we need to ensure that `results` contains at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given the provided state:
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
- `input` remains unchanged as the content read from standard input.
- `data` remains unchanged as a list where each element is a line from the input content.
- `t` remains unchanged as an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `idx` is `2 * t + 1`.
- `results` holds the value returned by `func_1(test_cases)`.

To ensure the loop executes, `results` must be a list with at least one element. The state of `test_cases`, `input`, `data`, `t`, and `idx` do not affect the execution of the for loop directly. However, since `results` is derived from `test_cases` via `func_1(test_cases)`, we need to ensure that `func_1(test_cases)` returns a non-empty list.

For the sake of this task, we will assume that `func_1(test_cases)` is designed to return a list of results corresponding to each test case in `test_cases`. Therefore, to ensure `results` is non-empty, `test_cases` must also be non-empty.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `input` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `idx` is `2 * t + 1`, `results` is a list with at least one element**.

However, since we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and `results` is the only object in the loop head, we can simplify this to:

State: **`results` is a list with at least one element**.
