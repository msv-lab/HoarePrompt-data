test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n (an integer representing the size of the array), x (an integer representing one of Polycarp's favorite integers), y (an integer representing the other favorite integer), and arr (a list of integers representing the elements of the array). It is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each element a_i in arr.
