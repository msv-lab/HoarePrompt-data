The provided code snippet `input = sys.stdin.read` does not change any of the variables in the initial state. It simply reads input from standard input and assigns it to the variable `input`. However, since the input is not processed or assigned to any of the existing variables (`test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`), the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer representing the length of the array), `x` (an integer representing one of Polycarp's favorite integers), `y` (an integer representing the other favorite integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers representing the elements of the array); `input` is the content read from standard input.**
