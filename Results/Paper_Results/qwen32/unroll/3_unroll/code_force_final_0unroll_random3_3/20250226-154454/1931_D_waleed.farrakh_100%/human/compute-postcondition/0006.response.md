Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. Each tuple represents the parsed data for one test case. `input` remains unchanged as the content read from standard input. `data` remains unchanged as a list where each element is a line from the input content. `t` remains unchanged as an integer representing the number of test cases. `idx` is now `2 * t + 1`, reflecting the position after processing all test cases.**
