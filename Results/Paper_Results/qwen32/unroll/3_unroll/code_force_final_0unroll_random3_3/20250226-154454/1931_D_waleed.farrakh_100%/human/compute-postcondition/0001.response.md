The code reads from standard input and splits the content into lines, storing the result in the variable `data`. The initial state mentions `test_cases` and `input`, but these are not directly modified by the provided code snippet. The only change is that `data` is now assigned the value of `input().splitlines()`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer representing the length of the array), `x` (an integer representing one of Polycarp's favorite integers), `y` (an integer representing the other favorite integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers representing the elements of the array); `input` is the content read from standard input; `data` is a list where each element is a line from the input content.**
