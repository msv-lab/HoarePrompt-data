### Reasoning:

The problem requires identifying "beautiful pairs" in an array, where a pair (i, j) is considered beautiful if:
1. `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
2. `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

Let's break down the provided functions and verify if they meet the problem's requirements.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: This function processes a list of test cases and calculates the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.
- **Approach**:
  - For each test case, it initializes an empty dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(rx, ry)`.
  - For each element `a` in the array, it calculates:
    - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x`: This computes the adjusted remainder of `a` when divided by `x`. The adjustment ensures the remainder is non-negative.
    - `ry = a % y`: This computes the remainder of `a` when divided by `y`.
  - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq` and adds the count to the total count of beautiful pairs.
  - It then updates the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in the `freq` dictionary.
- **Output**: Returns a list of counts of beautiful pairs for each test case.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: This function reads input from standard input, parses it into test cases, and uses `func_1` to compute the results.
- **Approach**:
  - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
  - It stores each test case as a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` in the `test_cases` list.
  - It calls `func_1` with `test_cases` and prints the results.

### Verification:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function correctly calculates the adjusted remainder `rx` to ensure non-negativity.
  - It correctly checks for previously seen pairs `(rx, ry)` and updates the count of beautiful pairs.
  - It updates the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` correctly.
- **Function `func_2`**:
  - The function correctly reads and parses the input.
  - It correctly processes each test case using `func_1` and prints the results.

### Conclusion:
Both functions work together to solve the problem as described. They correctly identify and count beautiful pairs in the array for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
