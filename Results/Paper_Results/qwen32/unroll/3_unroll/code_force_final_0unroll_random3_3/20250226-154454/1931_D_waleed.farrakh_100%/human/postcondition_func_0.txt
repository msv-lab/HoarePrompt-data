The function `func_1` processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of an array size `n`, two favorite integers `x` and `y`, and an array `arr`. For each test case, it calculates the count of previously seen pairs `(rx, ry)` for each element in the array, where `rx` is the adjusted remainder of the element when divided by `x`, and `ry` is the remainder of the element when divided by `y`. The function returns a list of these counts, one for each test case.
