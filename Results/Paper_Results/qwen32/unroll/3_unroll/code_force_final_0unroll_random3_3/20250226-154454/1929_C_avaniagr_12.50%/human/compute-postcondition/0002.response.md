To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop affects the variables `k`, `x`, and `a` in each iteration. The loop does not modify the value of `t` (the number of iterations), but it does read new values for `k`, `x`, and `a` in each iteration from the input.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what happens in each iteration:

1. **Input Reading**: In each iteration, new values for `k`, `x`, and `a` are read from the input.
2. **Condition Checking**:
   - If `x < k - 1`:
     - If `a >= x + 1`, print 'YES'.
     - Otherwise, print 'NO'.
   - If `x == k - 1`:
     - If `a >= x + 3`, print 'YES'.
     - Otherwise, print 'NO'.
   - If `x > k - 1`:
     - Initialize `z` to 0.
     - For `i` from 0 to `x` (inclusive), update `z` using the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`.
     - If `a >= z`, print 'YES'.
     - Otherwise, print 'NO'.

Since the loop reads new values for `k`, `x`, and `a` in each iteration, the final values of `k`, `x`, and `a` after all iterations will be the values read in the last iteration. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is the loop counter.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations will be the state of `t`, along with the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` from the last iteration.

Output State: **t is the same as the initial t, k, x, and a are the values read in the last iteration.**
