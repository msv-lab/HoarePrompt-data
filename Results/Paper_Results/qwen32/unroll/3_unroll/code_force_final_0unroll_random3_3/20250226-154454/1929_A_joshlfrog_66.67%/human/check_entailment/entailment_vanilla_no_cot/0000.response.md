Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array. The beauty is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, which maximizes the beauty when the array is sorted in either ascending or descending order.

The program incorrectly calculates the beauty as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which is not the same as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

To solve the problem correctly, the program should sort the array and then compute the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        nums.sort()  # Sort the array
        beauty = 0
        for i in range(1, l):
            beauty += nums[i] - nums[i - 1]
        print(beauty)
```

This program sorts the array and then calculates the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, which is the correct approach.
