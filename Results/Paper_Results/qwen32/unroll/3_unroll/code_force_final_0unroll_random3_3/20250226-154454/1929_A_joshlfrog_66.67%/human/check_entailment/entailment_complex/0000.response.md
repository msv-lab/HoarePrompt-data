Reasoning:  
The given problem asks for the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array optimally. The beauty can be maximized by arranging the array in either ascending or descending order. In both cases, the beauty is equivalent to the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.

The provided program calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in each array, which indeed gives the maximum possible beauty as described. For each test case, it reads the array, finds the maximum and minimum values, and prints their difference.

The annotated program correctly describes the steps taken by the function. It initializes `x` to 0 and `y` to a large number, then iterates through each element of the array to find the maximum (`x`) and minimum (`y`) values. Finally, it prints the difference `x - y`, which is the maximum beauty for that test case.

Therefore, the program is correct for the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
