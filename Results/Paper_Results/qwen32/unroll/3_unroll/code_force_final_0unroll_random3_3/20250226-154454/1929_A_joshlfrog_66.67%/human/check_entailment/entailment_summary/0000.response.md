Reasoning:  
The provided program calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array for each test case. However, this does not align with the problem description, which requires calculating the maximum beauty of the array based on the sum of differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array to maximize this sum.

The maximum beauty can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending or descending order. In either case, the beauty will be the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, which simplifies to the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array when the array is sorted. However, the current program does not sort the array; it merely finds the maximum and minimum values and computes their difference, which is not the intended approach.

The given program's logic is flawed because it does not consider the order of elements in the array. The correct approach involves sorting the array and then calculating the beauty as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
