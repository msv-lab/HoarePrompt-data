### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Structure Representation**:
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to represent the tree structure, where each node points to a list of its neighbors. This is a common and effective way to represent a graph or tree in Python.

2. **Recursive Distance Calculation (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is a recursive function that calculates the distances from the starting node to all other nodes in the tree.
   - If a node is a leaf (i.e., it has only one neighbor, which is its parent), it returns a distance of 0.
   - For non-leaf nodes, it recursively calculates the distances to all its children (excluding the parent) and adds 1 to each distance.

3. **Leaf Node Identification**:
   - The program identifies all leaf nodes in the tree and stores them in a deque called `leaves`. However, this deque is not used in the current implementation of the game logic. This part of the code seems redundant for the given problem.

4. **Game Logic**:
   - The game logic is implemented in `func_2`. It reads the input, constructs the tree, and determines the winner based on the distances calculated by `func_1`.
   - If any of the distances from the starting node to other nodes is odd, Ron wins. Otherwise, Hermione wins. This is because if there is an odd distance, Ron can force a win by making the first move to a node that is an odd distance away, ensuring that he always has a move when the number of remaining moves is odd.

5. **Execution States and Output**:
   - The provided execution states and output match the expected behavior of the program. For the given example, the starting node is 1, and the distances to other nodes are calculated. Since there is at least one odd distance (from node 1 to node 2, node 3), Ron wins.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules and the structure of the tree. The redundant identification of leaf nodes does not affect the correctness of the game logic.

**Correctness: True**
