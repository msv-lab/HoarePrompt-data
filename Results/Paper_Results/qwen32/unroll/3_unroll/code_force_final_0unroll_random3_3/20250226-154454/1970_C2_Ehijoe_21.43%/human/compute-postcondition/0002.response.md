The code snippet provided sets the variable `empty` to `True`. This change affects only the `empty` variable, and all other variables retain their initial values. 

Output State: **`nodes` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing neighboring nodes, `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n, `n` is 5, `t` is 3, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True.**
