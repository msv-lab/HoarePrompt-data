### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Construction**: 
   - `func_2` reads the number of nodes `n` and the number of rounds `t` (which is always 1 in this problem).
   - It then reads `n-1` lines of edges to construct the tree using a dictionary `nodes` where each key is a node and the value is a list of its neighbors.

2. **Leaf Nodes Identification**:
   - The function identifies leaf nodes (nodes with only one neighbor) and stores them in a deque `leaves`. However, this part of the code is not used further in the function and is redundant for this problem.

3. **Game Logic**:
   - The function reads the starting node `start` for the game.
   - It then calls `func_1` to calculate all possible distances from the starting node to all other nodes in the tree.
   - `func_1` is a recursive function that traverses the tree and calculates the distances from the starting node to all reachable nodes. It returns a list of these distances.
   - After obtaining the distances, `func_2` checks if any of the distances are odd. If at least one distance is odd, it means Ron can make the last move and thus wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.

4. **Optimal Play**:
   - The game involves two players making optimal moves. The key observation here is that if the maximum distance from the starting node to any leaf is odd, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins. This is because Ron makes the first move, and if the total number of moves (which is the distance to the farthest leaf) is odd, Ron will make the last move.

5. **Output**:
   - Based on the above logic, the function prints "Ron" if any distance is odd and "Hermione" otherwise.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the distances calculated from the starting node. Since the program follows the optimal strategy for both players and correctly identifies the winner, it is correct.

**Correctness: True**
