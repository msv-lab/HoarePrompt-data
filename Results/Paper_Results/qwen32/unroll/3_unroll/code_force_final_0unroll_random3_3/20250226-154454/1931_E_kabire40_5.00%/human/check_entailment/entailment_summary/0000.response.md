### Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules and logic as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Reversing Digits**:
   - The program reverses the digits of each number and checks if the length of the reversed number is the same as the original. If it is, it appends the original number to `rev_res`. If not, it appends the reversed number to `rev_val`. This part is somewhat correct but not optimal and does not fully consider the optimal moves for Anna and Sasha.

2. **Sorting and Constructing Result**:
   - The program sorts the reversed values and then constructs a string by alternating between appending reversed and non-reversed numbers. This is not how the game rules specify Sasha's optimal move. Sasha's move involves concatenating any two numbers in any order, not necessarily alternating between reversed and non-reversed numbers.

3. **Winning Condition**:
   - The final comparison checks if the constructed number is greater than `10^m` to determine the winner. However, the way the number is constructed does not reflect the optimal strategy for Sasha to win.

4. **Optimal Play**:
   - The game requires both players to play optimally. The current program does not consider strategic moves for Sasha to concatenate numbers in a way that maximizes the resulting number. Similarly, it does not consider strategic reversals by Anna to minimize the final number.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly simulate the game and does not determine the winner based on optimal play for both players. It fails to implement the rules correctly, especially Sasha's turn where he can concatenate numbers in any order to maximize the result.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
