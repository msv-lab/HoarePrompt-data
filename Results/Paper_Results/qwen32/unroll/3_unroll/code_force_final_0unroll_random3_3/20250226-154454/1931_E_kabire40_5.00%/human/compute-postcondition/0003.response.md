Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `m`, and a list of `n` integers. It reverses the integers, sorts them, and then constructs a result string by alternating between appending the reversed and non-reversed integers. It then compares this result string with `10` raised to the power of `m`. Depending on the comparison, it prints either 'Sasha' or 'Anna'.**
