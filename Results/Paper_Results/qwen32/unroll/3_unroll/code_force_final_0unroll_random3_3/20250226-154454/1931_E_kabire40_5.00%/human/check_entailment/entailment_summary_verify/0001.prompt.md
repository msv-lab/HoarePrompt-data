You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

- Program:
def func():
    for y in range(int(input())):
        rev_val = []
        rev_res = ''
        (list_len, max_power) = input().split()
        operational_list = input().split()
        for x in operational_list:
            x_rev = int(x[::-1])
            if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
                rev_res = rev_res + x
            else:
                rev_val.append(x[::-1])
        rev_val.sort()
        for x in range(len(rev_val)):
            if x % 2 == 0:
                val_in = int(rev_val[x])
                rev_res += str(val_in)
            else:
                val_in = rev_val[x]
                rev_res += val_in[::-1]
        if 10 ** int(max_power) < int(rev_res):
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Anna')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `m`, and a list of `n` integers. It reverses the integers, sorts them, and then constructs a result string by alternating between appending the reversed and non-reversed integers. It then compares this result string with `10` raised to the power of `m`. Depending on the comparison, it prints either 'Sasha' or 'Anna'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. **Anna's Move**: She reverses the digits of a chosen number.
2. **Sasha's Move**: He concatenates two numbers in any order and removes them from the list.
3. **Winning Condition**: Sasha wins if the final number is not less than \(10^m\).

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the parameter `m`.
   - It then reads the list of integers.

2. **Reversing the Digits**:
   - The program reverses the digits of each number in the list.
   - If the reversed number has the same length as the original number, it is directly concatenated to `rev_res`.
   - Otherwise, it is added to `rev_val`.

3. **Sorting and Concatenation**:
   - The program sorts `rev_val` (which contains the reversed numbers with different lengths).
   - It then concatenates the numbers in `rev_val` in a specific order: if the index is even, it adds the number as is; if the index is odd, it reverses it again.
   - This step is problematic because it doesn't consider the optimal strategy for Sasha and Anna. It simply concatenates numbers in a fixed pattern, which may not lead to the optimal result for Sasha.

4. **Winning Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if the final concatenated number is greater than or equal to \(10^m\).
   - If it is, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not implement the optimal strategy for Sasha and Anna.
- The concatenation logic does not take into account the best way to form a number that is not less than \(10^m\).
- The program assumes a fixed pattern for concatenation, which may not be optimal.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program does not guarantee that it will determine the correct winner based on optimal play from both Sasha and Anna.

**Correctness: False**

The program needs to be revised to correctly simulate the optimal moves of both players and determine the winner accurately.
