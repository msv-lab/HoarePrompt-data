Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. For each test case, it calculates a value `k` based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` and prints either `-1` or the calculated value of `k`. The function does not return any value explicitly; it outputs the result for each test case directly.**
