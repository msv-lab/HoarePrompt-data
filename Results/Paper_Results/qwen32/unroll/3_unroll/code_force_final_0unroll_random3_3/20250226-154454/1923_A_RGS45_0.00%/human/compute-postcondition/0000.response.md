Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, and the second line contains a list of `n` integers `a_i` where each `a_i` is either 0 or 1. There is at least one 1 in each test case's list.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the input integer, but the other variables (`n`, `a_i`) remain unchanged as they will be assigned values in subsequent code that is not provided here. The constraints and conditions on `t`, `n`, and `a_i` remain valid.
