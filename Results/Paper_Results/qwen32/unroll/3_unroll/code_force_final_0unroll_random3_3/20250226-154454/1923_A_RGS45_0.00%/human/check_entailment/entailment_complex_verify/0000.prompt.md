You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = str(input(''))
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and the second line contains a list of n integers a_i where each a_i is either 0 or 1. There is at least one 1 in each test case's list.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = str(input(''))
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: The output state consists of `t` lines, each containing the count of '0's in the sub-string between the first and last '1' for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` do not retain their values after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` binary integers (each being either 0 or 1, with at least one 1 in each list). For each test case, it calculates and prints the count of '0's in the sub-string between the first and last '1' in the list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads `n` (the number of cells) and the string `arr` representing the cells.
   - The string `arr` is read using `str(input(''))`. However, the input is supposed to be a sequence of integers (0s and 1s) separated by spaces. The correct way to read this input would be to use `list(map(int, input().split()))`.

2. **Finding Positions of Chips**:
   - The program finds the first occurrence of '1' in the string `arr` using `arr.find('1')`. This gives the index of the first chip.
   - It then finds the last occurrence of '1' by reversing the string and finding the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr[::-1]`. This gives the index of the last chip from the end of the string, which is `n - y - 1` in the original string.

3. **Counting Free Cells**:
   - The program slices the string between the first and last chip positions using `z = arr[x:n - y]` and counts the number of '0's in this slice using `z.count('0')`.
   - However, this approach does not correctly calculate the minimum number of moves required. The correct approach is to consider the positions of all chips and calculate the cost of moving them towards each other.

### Test Case Analysis:
Let's consider the first example from the problem statement:
```
5
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```
- The program reads `arr` as `"0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0"`.
- `x = arr.find('1')` will be `1` (index of the first '1').
- `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` will be `2` (index of the first '1' in the reversed string, which corresponds to index `8 - 2 - 1 = 5` in the original string).
- `z = arr[x:n - y]` will be `"1 1 1 0 1 1"`.
- `z.count('0')` will be `1`, but the correct answer is `1` (which is correct in this case, but this is not a general solution).

However, consider another test case:
```
6
0 1 0 1 0 1
```
- The program will read `arr` as `"0 1 0 1 0 1"`.
- `x = arr.find('1')` will be `1`.
- `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` will be `1` (index of the first '1' in the reversed string, which corresponds to index `6 - 1 - 1 = 4` in the original string).
- `z = arr[x:n - y]` will be `"1 0 1 0"`.
- `z.count('0')` will be `2`, but the correct answer is `2` (which is correct in this case, but this is not a general solution).

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you should:
1. Identify the positions of all chips in the array.
2. Calculate the cost of moving all chips to each possible position where they can form a contiguous block.
3. Find the position with the minimum cost.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        chip_positions = [i for i in range(n) if arr[i] == 1]
        min_moves = float('inf')
        for i in range(len(chip_positions)):
            moves = sum(abs(chip_positions[j] - chip_positions[i]) for j in range(len(chip_positions)))
            min_moves = min(min_moves, moves)
        print(min_moves // 2)

func()
```

This corrected program reads the input correctly, identifies the positions of all chips, and calculates the minimum number of moves required to form a single block of chips.
