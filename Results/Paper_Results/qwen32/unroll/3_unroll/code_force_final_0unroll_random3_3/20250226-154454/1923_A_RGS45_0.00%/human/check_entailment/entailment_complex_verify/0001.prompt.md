You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = str(input(''))
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and the second line contains a list of n integers a_i where each a_i is either 0 or 1. There is at least one 1 in each test case's list.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = str(input(''))
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: The output state consists of `t` lines, each containing the count of '0's in the sub-string between the first and last '1' for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` do not retain their values after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` binary integers (each being either 0 or 1, with at least one 1 in each list). For each test case, it calculates and prints the count of '0's in the sub-string between the first and last '1' in the list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Understanding
The goal is to move chips so that they form a continuous block with no free cells between them. The minimum number of operations required should be calculated.

### Program Analysis
The provided program reads input for multiple test cases. For each test case, it:
1. Reads the number of cells `n`.
2. Reads the configuration of the cells as a string `arr`.
3. Finds the position of the first chip (`x`).
4. Finds the position of the last chip (`y` from the end, which is equivalent to `n - y - 1` from the start).
5. Constructs a substring `z` from the first chip to the last chip.
6. Counts the number of free cells (`'0'`) in this substring and prints the count.

### Issues with the Program
1. **Incorrect Indexing for Last Chip**: The line `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` finds the index of the last chip from the end of the string, but it does not correctly convert it to the index from the start of the string. It should be `n - y - 1`.
2. **Substring Construction**: The line `z = arr[x:n - y]` is not correct. It should be `z = arr[x:n - y]` corrected to `z = arr[x:n - y + 1]` to include the last chip.
3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where the chips are already in a continuous block correctly. The logic should ensure that the count of free cells is only calculated when necessary.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Identify the range of indices that contain chips.
2. Count the number of free cells within this range.

### Correct Program Implementation
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        first_chip = arr.index(1)
        last_chip = len(arr) - 1 - arr[::-1].index(1)
        block = arr[first_chip:last_chip + 1]
        free_cells = block.count(0)
        print(free_cells)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion
The original program is incorrect due to improper handling of indices and incorrect substring construction. Thus, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem.
