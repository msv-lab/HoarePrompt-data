To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's break down the code step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `N` is the first integer read from the input.
   - `nums` is a list of integers read from the input line, with an additional `-1` appended to it.
   - `s` is initialized to `0`.
   - `e` is initialized to `0`.
   - `num` is initialized to the first element of `nums`.
   - `arr` is initialized to an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over the range `N + 1`, meaning it will run `N + 1` times.
   - In each iteration `i`, the loop checks if `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`.
     - If `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, it appends a tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to `arr` and updates `s` to `i`.
   - Regardless of the condition, `num` is updated to `nums[i]` at the end of each iteration.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `arr` will contain tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`, along with their starting and ending indices.
   - The variable `s` will hold the index of the start of the last segment.
   - The variable `num` will hold the last number in `nums`.

Let's assume an example input to illustrate the process:
- Suppose `N` is `3` and `nums` is `[2, 2, 3, 3, -1]`.
- The loop will iterate 4 times (for `i` from `0` to `3`).

**Iteration Details**:
- **Iteration 0**:
  - `num` is `2` (from `nums[0]`).
  - `nums[0]` is `2`, so no tuple is appended to `arr`.
  - `num` is updated to `2`.

- **Iteration 1**:
  - `num` is `2`.
  - `nums[1]` is `2`, so no tuple is appended to `arr`.
  - `num` is updated to `2`.

- **Iteration 2**:
  - `num` is `2`.
  - `nums[2]` is `3`, so `(1 + 0, 2, 2)` is appended to `arr` → `arr` becomes `[(1, 2, 2)]`.
  - `s` is updated to `2`.
  - `num` is updated to `3`.

- **Iteration 3**:
  - `num` is `3`.
  - `nums[3]` is `3`, so no tuple is appended to `arr`.
  - `num` is updated to `3`.

- **Iteration 4**:
  - `num` is `3`.
  - `nums[4]` is `-1`, so `(1 + 2, 4, 3)` is appended to `arr` → `arr` becomes `[(1, 2, 2), (3, 4, 3)]`.
  - `s` is updated to `4`.
  - `num` is updated to `-1`.

**Final State**:
- `arr` will be `[(1, 2, 2), (3, 4, 3)]`.
- `s` will be `4`.
- `num` will be `-1`.

Output State: **`arr` is `[(1, 2, 2), (3, 4, 3)]`, `s` is `4`, `num` is `-1`.**
