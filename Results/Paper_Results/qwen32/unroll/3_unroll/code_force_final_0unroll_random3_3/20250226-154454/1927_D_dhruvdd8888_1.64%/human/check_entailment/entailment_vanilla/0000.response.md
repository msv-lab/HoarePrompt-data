Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Breakdown
The problem requires us to process multiple test cases, each consisting of an array of integers and a series of queries. Each query asks us to find two different indices within a specified range such that the elements at these indices are not equal. If no such pair exists, we should return -1 -1.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `N`, the array itself, and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then processes each query to find the required indices or determine that no such pair exists.

2. **Preprocessing the Array:**
   - The program creates a list `arr` that contains tuples representing contiguous segments of the array where all elements are the same. Each tuple contains the start index, end index, and the value of the segment.
   - This preprocessing step is crucial for efficiently handling the queries.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment in `arr` that starts at or after the left boundary of the query range.
   - It then checks the conditions to determine if a valid pair of indices can be found:
     - If the start of the segment is greater than `l`, it checks if there is a previous segment that can provide the required pair.
     - If the end of the segment is greater than or equal to `r`, it checks if a valid pair can be found within the segment.
     - If the end of the segment is less than `N`, it checks the next segment.
     - If none of these conditions are met, it outputs -1 -1.

### Issues in the Program
- **Handling Edge Cases:** The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, when the query range contains only one segment, the program might incorrectly return -1 -1.
- **Incorrect Index Handling:** The program does not correctly handle the indices when the query range is small or when the segments are at the boundaries of the array.
- **Inefficient Query Handling:** The program uses a binary search to find the segment but does not correctly handle the logic for finding the valid pair within the segment or across segments.

### Correctness
Given the issues identified in the program, it does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. The logic for handling queries and finding valid pairs needs to be more robust and correctly implemented.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
