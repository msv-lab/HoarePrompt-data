The code assigns the value of `len(arr) - 1` to the variable `LA`. Given that `arr` is `[(1, 2, 2), (3, 4, 3)]`, the length of `arr` is 2. Therefore, `LA` is assigned the value `2 - 1`, which is `1`.

The values of `arr`, `s`, and `num` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` is `[(1, 2, 2), (3, 4, 3)]`, `s` is `4`, `num` is `-1`, `LA` is `1`**.
