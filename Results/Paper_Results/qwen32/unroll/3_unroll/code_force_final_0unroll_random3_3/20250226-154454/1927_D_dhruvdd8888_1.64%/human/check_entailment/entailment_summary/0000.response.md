### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is intended to solve the problem by processing each test case individually. For each test case, it first compresses the array into segments of consecutive identical elements and stores these segments in a list called `arr`. Each segment is represented as a tuple containing the start index, the end index, and the value of the elements in the segment.

For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment that starts within the query range. It then checks the boundaries of this segment and the neighboring segments to determine if there are two distinct elements within the query range. If such a pair exists, it prints their indices; otherwise, it prints `-1 -1`.

However, there are several issues with the program that make it incorrect:

1. **Handling of Queries**: The program skips processing queries when `tc > 5` and `ppp == 23`. This is likely a debugging leftover and does not contribute to the correct solution.

2. **Logic for Finding Pairs**: The logic for finding indices of two different elements within the query range is flawed. Specifically:
   - The program checks if the segment starts within the range and then checks the boundaries of the segment and the neighboring segments. However, this approach does not guarantee that the found indices will always correspond to different elements.
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where the segment found by `bisect_left` does not contain the start of the query range or where the segment ends within the query range but no different element is found.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, it might incorrectly return `-1 -1` for ranges where a pair of different elements exists.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified in the reasoning, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct output for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
