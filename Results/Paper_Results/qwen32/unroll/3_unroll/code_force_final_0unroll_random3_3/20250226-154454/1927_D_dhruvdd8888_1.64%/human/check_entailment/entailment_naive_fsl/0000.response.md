Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided code does not correctly handle the problem as described. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Query Handling**:
   - The code has a conditional block `if tc > 5:` that skips processing most queries. This means that the code does not handle the queries as required for most test cases.
   - Specifically, the code only processes queries for the 24th test case (`if ppp == 23:`), and for other test cases, it just continues without processing the queries.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Different Elements**:
   - The logic for finding the indices `i` and `j` such that `a_i != a_j` within the range `[l, r]` is flawed.
   - The code uses `bisect_left` to find a segment in `arr` that starts at or before `l`, but it does not correctly check if there are two different elements within the range `[l, r]`.
   - The code does not handle the case where there are multiple segments within the range `[l, r]` and there might be different elements in different segments.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where the array segment `[l, r]` contains only one unique element.
   - The code does not correctly handle cases where the array segment `[l, r]` contains multiple unique elements.

### Example of Incorrectness:

Consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

The correct output should be:
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

However, the provided code will not produce the correct output because it skips processing most queries due to the `if tc > 5:` condition. For the 24th test case, it might work, but for other test cases, it will not process the queries correctly.

### Conclusion:

The code is incorrect because it does not handle queries correctly for most test cases and does not implement the logic to find two different elements within the specified range `[l, r]` properly.
