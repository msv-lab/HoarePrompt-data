Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a`, and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, there are `q` queries, where each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` representing the boundaries of the query. The function returns the sum of the elements in the array `a` from index `l` to `r` for each query.**
