You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    #State: The output state consists of a series of responses for each test case. For each string `s`, the program determines if it's possible to split the string into two parts such that the first part is not equal to the second part, or if the string is already unique or symmetrical in a specific way. The responses are printed line by line, indicating whether it's possible ('YES') or not ('NO') to make such a split, and if possible, the number of splits and the resulting parts of the string. The state of the variables `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `done`, `x`, `count`, and `count2` will vary based on each test case but will not persist beyond the current iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a string of lowercase Latin characters. For each string, it determines if it's possible to split the string into two parts such that the first part is not equal to the second part. If such a split is possible, it outputs 'YES', the number of splits (either 1 or 2), and the resulting parts of the string. If no such split is possible, it outputs 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the logic of the provided program and compare it with the requirements of the problem.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Partition the string** into substrings such that **each substring is not a palindrome**.
2. **Output**: 
   - "YES" if such a partition exists, followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves.
   - "NO" if no such partition exists.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Single Character Strings**:
   - The program correctly identifies that any single character string is a palindrome and outputs "NO".

2. **Strings with Different First and Last Characters**:
   - If the first and last characters of the string are different, the string itself is not a palindrome, so the program outputs "YES" with the string as a single part.
   - This is correct because a string with different first and last characters cannot be a palindrome.

3. **Strings with All Same Characters**:
   - If all characters in the string are the same, the program outputs "NO" because any substring of such a string is a palindrome.
   - This is correct.

4. **Strings with One Different Character**:
   - If all but one character in the string are the same, the program checks if the middle character (if the string length is odd) is different from the others. If it is, it outputs "NO".
   - If the middle character is the same, or the string length is even, it outputs "YES" with the string as a single part.
   - This logic is correct because if the string is of the form `aaaaXaaaa`, where `X` is the different character, the string itself is not a palindrome.

5. **General Case**:
   - The program checks for the first position `j` where `s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]`. If such a position is found, it means the string is not a palindrome, and the program outputs "YES" with the string as a single part.
   - If no such position is found, the program looks for the first character that is different from the first character `x` and keeps track of the positions. It then tries to split the string into two parts such that neither part is a palindrome.
   - If it finds such a split, it outputs "YES" with the two parts.

### Potential Issues:
- The logic for splitting the string into two parts when necessary is somewhat complex and could have edge cases that aren't fully covered.
- The program does not handle the case where the string is a palindrome and cannot be split into non-palindromic parts correctly in all cases.
- For example, a string like `"abccba"` should output "NO" because no matter how you split it, one of the parts will be a palindrome.

### Correctness:
Given the potential issues with the general case handling, especially the edge cases of palindromic strings, the program may not correctly handle all scenarios as required.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases, particularly for strings that are palindromes and cannot be split into non-palindromic parts.
