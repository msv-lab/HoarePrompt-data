### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to determine if it is correct.

**Problem Analysis:**
- Bob starts with a rectangle of size `a x b`.
- He can cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
- The two resulting rectangles should be used to form a new rectangle that is different from the original rectangle.
- Two rectangles are considered the same if one can be obtained by rotating the other.

**Key Observations:**
- If either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle. This is because:
  - If `a` is even, he can cut the rectangle into two `a/2 x b` rectangles.
  - If `b` is even, he can cut the rectangle into two `a x b/2` rectangles.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, then any cut will result in two rectangles of size `a x (b-1)/2` or `(a-1)/2 x b`, and these cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

**Program Analysis:**
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b`.
- It checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If so, it prints "Yes", indicating that another rectangle can be formed.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints "No".

**Conclusion:**
- The logic in the program correctly determines whether another rectangle can be formed based on the observations above.
- The program handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness: **True**
