Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, and for each of the `t` test cases, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is now assigned the value of the integer input, which is between 1 and 10^4, inclusive. The conditions for the test cases involving `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
