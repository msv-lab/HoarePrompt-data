You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then outputs 'Yes' if either `a` or `b` (or both) is even, and 'No' if both `a` and `b` are odd. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged after the function executes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly determines whether Bob can form another rectangle from the given rectangle by checking if either dimension (a or b) is even. If either dimension is even, it is possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a different rectangle. If both dimensions are odd, it is not possible to form a different rectangle.

The logic in the code is sound and handles all edge cases:
- If `a` is even, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles of dimensions `a/2 x b` and `a/2 x b`, which can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.
- If `b` is even, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles of dimensions `a x b/2` and `a x b/2`, which can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, the only possible cuts result in two `1 x b` or `a x 1` rectangles, which cannot form a different rectangle when rearranged.

The provided examples in the problem statement are also correctly handled by the program, and there are no edge cases that the program fails to address. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
