The function `func_1` reads a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, processes it, and prints the length of the longest substring that can be formed by replacing question marks with any lowercase Latin letters such that the substring reads the same forwards and backwards. If no such substring exists, it prints 0.
