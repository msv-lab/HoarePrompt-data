To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand what the loop does for each test case and what the final state of the program will be.

The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates the total cost based on the given conditions and prints the result. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are re-assigned in each iteration but do not affect the state outside the loop. The variable `t` is used to control the number of iterations and remains unchanged throughout the execution.

Here's a breakdown of what the loop does:
- If `b` (the price of the first bun) is less than or equal to `a` (the usual price of a bun), the total cost is simply `n * a` because there's no discount.
- If the difference `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the total cost is calculated using the formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.
- Otherwise, the total cost is the sum of two parts: the sum of the first `b - a` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, plus `a * n` for the remaining buns.

Given that the loop only prints the result for each test case and does not store any results or modify any variables outside the loop, the output state will be the sequence of printed results for each test case.

Output State: **The output state is a sequence of integers, each representing the total cost for the corresponding test case, printed one per line.**
