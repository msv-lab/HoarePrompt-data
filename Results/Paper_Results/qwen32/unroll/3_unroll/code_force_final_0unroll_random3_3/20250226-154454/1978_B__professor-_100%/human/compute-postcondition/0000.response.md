Output State: **`t` is an input integer, each test case consists of three integers n, a, and b (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9) where n is the number of buns, a is the usual price of a bun, and b is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price. There are t such test cases.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the input integer, representing the number of test cases. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case remain as described in the initial state.
