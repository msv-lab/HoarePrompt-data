You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        k = abs(n - m)
        if k & k - 1 == 0:
            print(k)
        elif k % 2 != 0:
            print(1)
        else:
            l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            f = k - q
            while f & f - 1 != 0:
                l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')
                p = len(l)
                q = 2 ** (p - 1)
                f = f - q
            print(f)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a number of test cases, each consisting of two distinct non-negative integers. For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference between the two integers and then determines the output based on specific conditions: if the difference is a power of 2, it outputs the difference; if the difference is odd, it outputs 1; otherwise, it outputs the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the difference.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
Given two distinct non-negative integers \( x \) and \( y \), we need to find the length of the longest common subsegment of the sequences \( a \) and \( b \), where:
- \( a_n = n \oplus x \)
- \( b_n = n \oplus y \)

The sequences are infinite, and the subsegment must be contiguous in both sequences.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program uses the following approach:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers \( x \) and \( y \).
3. It calculates \( k = |x - y| \).
4. Based on the value of \( k \), it determines the length of the longest common subsegment:
   - If \( k \) is a power of 2 (i.e., \( k \& (k - 1) == 0 \)), it prints \( k \).
   - If \( k \) is odd, it prints 1.
   - If \( k \) is even but not a power of 2, it enters a loop to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \) and subtracts it from \( k \) repeatedly until \( k \) becomes a power of 2, and then prints \( k \).

### Correctness Check:
Let's verify the logic:
1. **When \( k \) is a power of 2**:
   - If \( k \) is a power of 2, the sequences \( a \) and \( b \) will have a common subsegment of length \( k \). This is because the bitwise XOR operation will produce a repeating pattern that aligns every \( k \) elements, given that \( x \) and \( y \) differ by exactly \( k \) (a power of 2).
   - The condition `k & (k - 1) == 0` correctly identifies powers of 2.

2. **When \( k \) is odd**:
   - If \( k \) is odd, the sequences \( a \) and \( b \) will not have a common subsegment longer than 1. This is because the bitwise XOR of consecutive numbers with an odd difference will not align in a way that produces a longer common subsegment.
   - The condition `k % 2 != 0` correctly identifies odd numbers.

3. **When \( k \) is even but not a power of 2**:
   - If \( k \) is even but not a power of 2, the sequences \( a \) and \( b \) will have a common subsegment of length equal to the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \). This is because the bitwise XOR operation will produce a repeating pattern that aligns every \( 2^m \) elements, where \( 2^m \) is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \).
   - The loop in the program correctly finds this largest power of 2 by repeatedly subtracting the largest power of 2 less than or equal to the current value of \( k \) until \( k \) becomes a power of 2.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the length of the longest common subsegment based on the properties of the bitwise XOR operation and the differences between \( x \) and \( y \).

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
