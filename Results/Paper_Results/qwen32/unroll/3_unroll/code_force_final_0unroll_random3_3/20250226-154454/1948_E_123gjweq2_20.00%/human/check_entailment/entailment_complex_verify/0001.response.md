### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the provided program and the annotated version to evaluate its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to assign distinct integers to vertices and then partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.
- The edge condition for connecting two vertices \(i\) and \(j\) is \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
- The output should include the assignment of integers to vertices, the number of cliques, and the partition of vertices into cliques.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Array Assignment:**
   - `arr` is supposed to store the values assigned to each vertex.
   - `cliquess` is supposed to store the clique number for each vertex.
   - The number of cliques is calculated using `ceil(n / k)`, which is an upper bound but not necessarily the minimum.

2. **Function `func_1(n, k)`:**
   - `cliques = ceil(n / k)`: This calculates the number of cliques. It's a reasonable upper bound but not necessarily optimal.
   - `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized as lists of zeros.
   - The function then calls `make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)` for each clique.

3. **Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`:**
   - `small_element = left + 1`: The smallest element in the current segment.
   - `big_element = right + 1`: The largest element in the current segment.
   - The function fills the segment `[left, right]` with values from `small_element` to `big_element` and assigns the same clique number to all elements in this segment.

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Edge Condition Not Checked:**
   - The program does not explicitly check the edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) for every pair of vertices. It simply assigns values and cliques in a way that is supposed to minimize the number of cliques, but this is not guaranteed to be correct.
   
2. **Optimal Clique Partitioning:**
   - The program does not guarantee the minimum number of cliques. It simply divides the vertices into `ceil(n / k)` cliques, which may not be optimal.

3. **Global Variables:**
   - The arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are used globally within the `make_array` function, which can lead to issues if the function is called multiple times or if the program is expanded.

#### Annotated Code Review:

- **Function `func_1(n, k)`:**
  - The state annotations suggest that `arr` should be filled with consecutive integers and `cliquess` should be filled with clique identifiers. However, the annotations incorrectly state that `cliquess` remains unchanged as all zeros, which is incorrect because `make_array` modifies `cliquess`.

- **Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`:**
  - The annotations correctly describe how `arr` and `cliquess` are modified within the segment `[left, right]`. However, the annotations do not reflect the actual behavior of the program, which is to fill `arr` with consecutive integers and `cliquess` with the clique identifier.

#### Conclusion:

Given the issues mentioned, the program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure that the edge condition is satisfied for all pairs of vertices and does not guarantee the minimum number of cliques. The annotations also incorrectly describe the behavior of the program in some parts.

**Final: False**

The program is incorrect based on the provided analysis and annotated code review.
