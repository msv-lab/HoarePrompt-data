Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summaries to ensure it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
The goal is to find the optimal position `i` to place the road such that:
- At least half of the residents on each side of the road are satisfied with their choice of living on that side.
- The position `i` should be as close to the middle of the village as possible.
- If there are multiple such positions, the smallest one should be chosen.

### Program Analysis:

#### `func_1()` Breakdown:
1. **Input Reading**: Reads the number of houses `n` and the string `a` representing the preferences of the residents.
2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: Constructs a list `S` where `S[i]` is a tuple `(x, y)` representing the number of '0's and '1's in the first `i` houses.
   - `S[0]` is initialized as `[0, 0]`.
   - For each character `s` in `a`, the counts of '0's and '1's are updated accordingly.
3. **Finding the Optimal Position**:
   - Iterates over all possible positions `i` from `0` to `n`.
   - For each position `i`, calculates the number of '0's (`left`) and '1's (`right`) on the left and right sides of the road, respectively.
   - Checks if the conditions are met: at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
     - This is done by checking if `left * 2 >= i` (equivalent to `left >= ceil(i / 2)`) and `right * 2 >= n - i` (equivalent to `right >= ceil((n - i) / 2)`).
   - If the conditions are met and the current position is closer to the middle of the village than the previously found position, it updates the answer.
4. **Output**: Prints the optimal position `i`.

#### `func_2()` Breakdown:
- Handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1()` for each one.

### Function Summary:
- `func_2()`: The function `func_2` repeatedly calls `func_1` a number of times specified by user input and performs no other actions. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

### Correctness Check:
1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum array `S` is correctly built to keep track of the counts of '0's and '1's.
2. **Condition Check**: The conditions to check if at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied are correctly implemented using the logic `left * 2 >= i` and `right * 2 >= n - i`.
3. **Optimal Position Selection**: The program correctly selects the position `i` that is closest to the middle of the village, and in case of a tie, it selects the smaller one.
4. **Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2()` correctly handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1()`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position for the road based on the given problem statement. It handles all edge cases and constraints appropriately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
