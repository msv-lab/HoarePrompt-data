### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the optimal position to place a road that divides the village into two sides such that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with their side of the village. The solution involves iterating through all possible positions for the road and checking if the conditions are met, then selecting the position that is closest to the middle of the village.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` is the number of houses.
   - `a` is the string representing the preferences of the residents.
   - `S` is a list that keeps track of cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to each house.
   
2. **Building the Prefix Sum Array**:
   - The function iterates through each character in `a`.
   - It updates the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's and appends them to `S`.
   
3. **Finding the Optimal Position**:
   - The function iterates through all possible positions `i` where the road can be placed (from 0 to `n`).
   - For each position `i`, it calculates:
     - `left`, the number of '0's on the left side of the road.
     - `lsum`, the number of houses on the left side of the road.
     - `right`, the number of '1's on the right side of the road.
     - `rsum`, the number of houses on the right side of the road.
   - It checks if the conditions are met:
     - `left * 2 >= lsum` (at least half of the residents on the left side want to live on the left).
     - `right * 2 >= rsum` (at least half of the residents on the right side want to live on the right).
   - If the conditions are met, it checks if the current position `i` is closer to the middle of the village than the previously found position `ans`.
   - If it is, it updates `ans` to `i`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the optimal position `ans`.

#### Analysis of `func_2`:
- This function handles multiple test cases.
- It reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Correctness:

The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It correctly calculates the prefix sums of '0's and '1's, checks the conditions for each possible position of the road, and finds the optimal position that is closest to the middle of the village. The code handles multiple test cases as described.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
