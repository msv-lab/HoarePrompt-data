The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs `-1`. The initial state provides information about various variables and their properties, but the `print` statement itself does not depend on any of these variables. It directly outputs the integer `-1`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
   - `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n.
   - `arr` is a list of integers read from input.
   - `flag` is True.
   - `ans` is the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in `arr`.
   - `val` is the last unique element counted in the loop.
   - `cnt` is the length of the last sequence of identical elements in `arr`.
   - `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.
   - Since `flag` is True, all elements in `arr` are the same.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The `print(-1)` statement is executed.
   - This statement does not depend on any of the variables defined in the initial state. It simply prints the integer `-1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is `-1`.

Output: **-1**
