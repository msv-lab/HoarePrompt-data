Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- An array is considered "beautiful" if, by repeatedly choosing an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le |a| - 1 \)) such that \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \) and replacing \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \), we can make all elements of the array the same.
- We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a given "beautiful" array to make it stop being "beautiful". If it's impossible, we should return -1.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads the size of the array and the array itself.
   
2. **Checking if the Array is Uniform**:
   - The variable `flag` is used to check if all elements in the array are the same.
   - If any two consecutive elements are different, `flag` is set to `False` and the loop breaks.
   
3. **Finding the Minimum Length of Subarrays**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to infinity.
   - It then iterates over the array to find the minimum length of contiguous subarrays that have the same value.
   - The minimum length of such subarrays is stored in `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - If `flag` is `True` (meaning the array is uniform), the program outputs `-1` because a uniform array will always remain beautiful no matter how many elements are removed.
   - Otherwise, it outputs the minimum length of subarrays (`ans`), which is supposed to be the minimum number of elements to remove to break the "beautiful" property.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Elements to Remove**:
  - The program calculates the minimum length of contiguous subarrays with the same value, but this doesn't necessarily give the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
  - Consider the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`. The minimum length of contiguous subarrays with the same value is 3, but removing 3 elements (e.g., the middle 3's) doesn't make the array non-beautiful. Instead, removing 3 elements (e.g., the first three 3's) does.
- **Logic for Non-Uniform Arrays**:
  - The logic for non-uniform arrays is flawed. The program should consider more complex scenarios to determine the minimum number of elements to remove.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
