### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initial Check**:
   - The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same by iterating through the array and setting `flag` to `False` if it finds any two consecutive elements that are different.
   - If `flag` remains `True` after the loop, it means all elements are the same, and the program correctly outputs `-1` because an array of identical elements will always be beautiful regardless of how many elements are removed.

2. **Finding Minimum Consecutive Identical Elements**:
   - If the array is not entirely composed of the same element, the program then finds the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in the array.
   - It does this by iterating through the array, counting the length of consecutive identical elements (`cnt`), and updating `ans` (which is initially set to `Infinity`) with the minimum count found.
   - After the loop, it performs a final check to ensure the last sequence of identical elements is considered.

3. **Output**:
   - If `flag` is `True`, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the value of `ans`, which is the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.

### Issues in the Program:

- **Logic Error in Minimum Count Calculation**:
  - The logic for calculating the minimum length of consecutive identical elements is flawed. The program does not correctly handle scenarios where the minimum sequence is at the end of the array or when there are multiple sequences of the same minimum length.
  - Specifically, the current implementation might not correctly identify the minimum sequence length if the array ends with the longest sequence of identical elements.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove in all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **False**
