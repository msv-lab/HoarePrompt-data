### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem description to evaluate its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a "beautiful" array to make it stop being beautiful.
- An array is "beautiful" if we can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.
- If the array is already uniform (all elements are the same), we should return `-1` because it's impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Uniform Array Check**:
   - The program correctly checks if the array is uniform by iterating through the array and setting a `flag` to `False` if it finds any two consecutive elements that are different.
   - If the array is uniform (`flag` remains `True`), it correctly outputs `-1`.

2. **Counting Minimum Removals**:
   - The program attempts to find the minimum length of consecutive identical elements (`ans`) in the array.
   - It initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` and iterates through the array, updating `ans` with the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.

#### Issues in the Program:
- The program's approach to finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed.
- The logic for determining the minimum length of consecutive identical elements does not necessarily translate to the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

#### Example Case Analysis:
Consider the input:
```
1
6
1 2 1 2 1 2
```
- The array is not uniform, so the program proceeds to find the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.
- The minimum length of consecutive identical elements is `2` (e.g., `1 1` or `2 2`).
- However, the program outputs `2`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `1` because removing any single element (e.g., the second element) results in a non-beautiful array.

#### Correct Approach:
- To correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove, we need to consider how breaking the sequence of identical elements affects the array's beauty.
- The approach should involve checking how removing a single element can disrupt the sequence and make the array non-beautiful.

#### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. The logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed, as demonstrated by the example case.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful in all cases.
