Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of sticks and their corresponding exponents. It calculates and prints the number of ways to choose three sticks such that their lengths are the same, considering the lengths as powers of 2 based on the exponents. If there are fewer than three sticks, it outputs 0.**
