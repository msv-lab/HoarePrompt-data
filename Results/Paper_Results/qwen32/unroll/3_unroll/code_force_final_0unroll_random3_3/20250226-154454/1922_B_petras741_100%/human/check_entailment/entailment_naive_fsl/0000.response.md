Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle. The current implementation seems to be counting combinations of sticks based on their lengths but does not check the triangle inequality condition, which is crucial for forming a non-degenerate triangle.

The triangle inequality theorem states that for any three lengths to form a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. This condition is not checked in the provided code.

Let's consider an example to demonstrate this:

**Input:**
```
1
4
3 2 1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```
Explanation: The valid combinations are (3, 2, 1) and (3, 3, 2).

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
2
```
This specific example works by chance, but let's consider another case:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```
Explanation: The only valid combination is (2, 3, 4), since 2 + 3 > 4, 2 + 4 > 3, and 3 + 4 > 2.

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
4
```
The program incorrectly counts all combinations of three sticks without checking the triangle inequality condition.

To fix the program, we need to iterate through all combinations of three sticks and check if they satisfy the triangle inequality condition. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import combinations

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lengths = [2**x for x in a]
        count = 0
        for combo in combinations(lengths, 3):
            if combo[0] + combo[1] > combo[2] and combo[0] + combo[2] > combo[1] and combo[1] + combo[2] > combo[0]:
                count += 1
        print(count)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected program uses the `combinations` function from the `itertools` module to generate all possible combinations of three stick lengths and checks if they satisfy the triangle inequality condition. If they do, it increments the count. This ensures that the program correctly identifies all valid combinations of sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle.
