Let's analyze the given code to determine if it correctly solves the problem according to the provided problem description.

### Key Points of the Problem:
1. Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a` until `a` is empty.
2. Alice wants to maximize the MEX of array `c` (where she adds elements), while Bob wants to minimize it.
3. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

### Strategy:
- Alice and Bob will play optimally.
- The number of elements in `a` is `n`, and all elements are in the range `[0, n-1]`.
- The game's score (MEX) is determined by the final state of `c`.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Counting Elements**:
   - The code initializes a counter array `cntl` of size `n+1` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It iterates over `a` and increments the count for each element in `cntl`.

2. **Handling the Case When `0` is Not Present**:
   - If `cntl[0]` (count of `0`s) is `0`, the MEX is `0` because `0` is not in `c`.
   - This is correct because if `0` is not in `a`, it will never be in `c` and thus the MEX is `0`.

3. **Calculating the MEX**:
   - The variable `c` is initialized to `min(2, cntl[0])`.
   - The code then iterates over the range `[1, n]` to find the smallest integer `j` for which `cntl[j] < 2`.
   - If `cntl[j] < 2`, it means `j` can be the MEX because it either appears less than twice or not at all in `a`.
   - The variable `c` is decremented each time an element with a count less than `2` is found.
   - If `c` reaches `0` or `j` reaches `n`, the MEX is printed as `j`.

### Issues in the Code:
- The logic for determining the MEX is flawed. The code does not correctly simulate the optimal play between Alice and Bob.
- The variable `c` is not used correctly to simulate the game's turns and the optimal strategy.
- The decrement of `c` and the condition `if not c or j == n` do not accurately determine the MEX based on the game's rules.

### Correct Approach:
- Alice will try to add elements to `c` such that the MEX is maximized.
- Bob will try to add elements to `c` such that the MEX is minimized.
- The optimal strategy involves understanding that if an element appears less than twice, it can be used to determine the MEX.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly simulate the optimal play between Alice and Bob and does not accurately calculate the MEX based on the game's rules. Therefore, the correctness of the code is:

Correctness: **False**
