The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. For each test case, it determines and prints the smallest index `j` such that there are fewer than two occurrences of any index from `0` to `j` in the list `a`. If all indices from `0` to `n` have at least two occurrences, it prints `n`.
