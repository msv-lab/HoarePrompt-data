To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it accurately computes the MEX of the array `c` after both players, Alice and Bob, have played optimally.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the problem and the program:

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Game Rules**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the final array `c`.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of the final array `c`.
   - The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array `c`.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice will pick elements to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will pick elements to minimize the MEX.
   - Since Alice starts, she can ensure that the MEX is as high as possible by strategically choosing elements.
   - Bob will counter by picking elements that prevent Alice from achieving a higher MEX.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - If `0` is not present in `a`, the MEX is `0` because `0` is the smallest non-negative integer.
   - If `0` is present, Alice can ensure that `0` is in `c` by picking it on her first turn.
   - The MEX will be the smallest integer that is not present in `c` after all elements are picked.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows a logic that seems to be based on the above observations:
1. **Counting Elements**:
   - It counts the occurrences of each element in `a` using `cntl`.
2. **Checking for `0`**:
   - If `0` is not present (`cntl[0] == 0`), it prints `0` as the MEX.
3. **Determining MEX**:
   - If `0` is present, it calculates a value `c` which seems to represent how many elements Alice can ensure are in `c` (up to `2`).
   - It then iterates through the elements from `1` to `n` and checks if the count of each element is less than `2`.
   - If an element count is less than `2`, it decrements `c` and checks if `c` is `0` or if the current element is `n`. If so, it prints the current element as the MEX.

### Issues in the Program:
The logic in the program to determine the MEX is flawed. Specifically:
- The variable `c` is used in a way that doesn't correctly simulate the optimal play between Alice and Bob.
- The decrementing of `c` and the conditions to break the loop do not accurately reflect the game dynamics and the MEX calculation.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve:
- Counting the occurrences of each element.
- Determining the smallest integer that is not present in `a` after accounting for the optimal play by Alice and Bob.
- This can be simplified by realizing that the MEX is essentially the smallest integer with an odd count in `a` (since Alice and Bob will cancel out pairs of elements).

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the program's logic, it does not correctly determine the MEX of the final array `c` after optimal play.

Correctness: **False**
