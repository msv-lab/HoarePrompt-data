Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty for all cases. The logic in the code does not ensure that the array is optimally split into subsequences `s` and `t` to minimize the penalty `p(s) + p(t)`. The code seems to attempt to keep track of the smallest elements seen so far and increments the penalty when it encounters an element that is larger than both smallest elements seen so far, but this approach does not guarantee an optimal split.

To better illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
4
1 3 2 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
One optimal split could be `s = [1, 3, 4]` and `t = [2]`. Here, `p(s) = 2` (since 1 < 3 and 3 < 4) and `p(t) = 0` (since `t` has only one element). Thus, the total penalty is `2 + 0 = 2`.

**Program Output:**
The provided program will output `1` for this test case, which is incorrect.

This example shows that the program does not always find the optimal split to minimize the penalty, hence the program is incorrect.
