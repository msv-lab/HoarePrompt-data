Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly. It processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, the function returns a value based on the elements in the list `a`. Specifically, it determines the number of elements in `a` that are unique and returns this count for each test case.**
