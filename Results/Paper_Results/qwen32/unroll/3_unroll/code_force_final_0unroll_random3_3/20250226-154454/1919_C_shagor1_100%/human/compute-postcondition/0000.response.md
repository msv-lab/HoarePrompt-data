The provided code snippet is `pass`, which is a no-operation statement in Python. It does not change any variables or states in the program. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
