Reasoning:  
The given program is supposed to output a set of points in an \( n \times n \) grid that maximizes the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of points. However, the current implementation does not achieve this goal for all values of \( n \).

For \( n = 2 \), the program correctly outputs the points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\), which results in a set \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\). This is optimal for \( n = 2 \).

For \( n = 3 \), the program outputs \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((3, 3)\). The set \(\mathcal{H}\) in this case is \(\{0, 1, 2, 4\}\), but a better arrangement would be \((2, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((3, 1)\), which results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\). Thus, the program does not produce the optimal solution for \( n = 3 \).

For \( n = 4 \), the program outputs \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), and \((4, 4)\). The set \(\mathcal{H}\) in this case is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6\}\), but a better arrangement would be \((1, 1)\), \((1, 3)\), \((4, 3)\), and \((4, 4)\), which results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\).

For \( n = 5 \), the program outputs \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), and \((5, 5)\). The set \(\mathcal{H}\) in this case does not cover all possible distinct Manhattan distances optimally.

For \( n = 6 \), the program outputs \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\), and \((6, 6)\). Again, the set \(\mathcal{H}\) does not cover all possible distinct Manhattan distances optimally.

The program seems to follow a pattern that is not optimal for maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \( n > 2 \). A correct implementation would need to strategically place points to achieve the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances.

Correctness: **False**
