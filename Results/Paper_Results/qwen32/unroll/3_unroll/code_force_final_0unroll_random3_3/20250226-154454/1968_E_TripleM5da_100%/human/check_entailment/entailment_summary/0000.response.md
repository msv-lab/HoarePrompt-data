Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells chosen on an `n x n` grid. The program starts by placing the first two cells at `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, which is correct for obtaining a distance of 1. However, for `n > 2`, the program places the remaining cells along the diagonal `(i, i)`. This placement does not maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances.

For example, when `n = 3`, the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
3 3
```
The set of Manhattan distances for these points is `{0, 1, 4}`, which has a size of 3. However, as shown in the problem statement, a better arrangement would be:
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```
This arrangement gives the set of Manhattan distances `{0, 1, 2, 3}`, which has a size of 4.

For larger `n`, the placement strategy `(i, i)` for `i >= 3` does not explore other possible placements that could yield more distinct distances. Therefore, the program does not guarantee the maximum size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Correctness: **False**
