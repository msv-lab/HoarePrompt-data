### Reasoning:
To determine if the program is correct, we need to verify that it accurately follows the logic required by the problem description. The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move. The goal is to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

The key observation is that for Nikita to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, the number of moves to add cubes must be exactly `m` more than the number of moves to remove cubes. If we let `a` be the number of moves to add cubes and `r` be the number of moves to remove cubes, then we have:
- \( a + r = n \) (total moves)
- \( a - r = m \) (net cubes added)

By adding these two equations, we get:
\[ 2a = n + m \]
\[ a = \frac{n + m}{2} \]

For `a` to be an integer, \( n + m \) must be even. This means \( n - m \) must also be even (since the parity of \( n + m \) and \( n - m \) is the same). Additionally, \( n \) must be at least \( m \) because the number of moves to add cubes cannot be negative.

The provided program checks if `n - m` is even and non-negative, which aligns with the derived condition. If these conditions are satisfied, it prints "Yes", otherwise "No".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Correctness: **True**
