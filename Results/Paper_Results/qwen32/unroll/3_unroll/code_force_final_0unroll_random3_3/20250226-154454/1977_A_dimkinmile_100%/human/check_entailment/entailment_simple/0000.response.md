### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove exactly one cube. 

The key observation is that the difference between `n` and `m` must be even and non-negative for it to be possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. Here's why:
- If `n - m` is even, it means that the total number of additions and subtractions must balance out to end up with exactly `m` cubes. This is because each addition and subtraction changes the count by 1, and an even difference means an even number of such operations.
- If `n - m` is non-negative, it means that the number of moves `n` is sufficient to reach `m` cubes, as we can't remove more cubes than we add initially (starting from 0).

The function `func_1()` correctly implements this logic by checking if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "Yes", otherwise, it prints "No".
