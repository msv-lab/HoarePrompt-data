The code reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The values of `n` and `m` are updated based on the input, while `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers as read from the input, where 1 <= n, m <= 100.**
