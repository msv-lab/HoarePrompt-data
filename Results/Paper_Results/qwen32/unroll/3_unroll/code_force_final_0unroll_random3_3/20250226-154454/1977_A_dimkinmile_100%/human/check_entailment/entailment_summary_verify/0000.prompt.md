You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input for each of `t` test cases. For each test case, it prints 'Yes' if the difference `n - m` is even and non-negative; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: Let's analyze the provided program and the problem description.

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move. We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` in the program is not fully accurate. Here's why:

1. **Case 1: n < m**
   - If `n < m`, Nikita can only add cubes. Since `n` moves are not enough to reach `m` cubes, the correct answer should be "No".
   - The condition `n - m >= 0` will be false in this case, so it will correctly print "No".

2. **Case 2: n >= m**
   - If `n >= m`, Nikita can add cubes up to `n` times. The difference `n - m` represents the number of surplus moves after reaching `m` cubes. If `n - m` is even, it means Nikita can add and remove cubes in pairs to end up with exactly `m` cubes.
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` will be true in this case, so it will correctly print "Yes".

However, the condition does not fully cover the scenario where `n` is odd and `m` is 0. In this case, Nikita can add and remove cubes in pairs, but since `n` is odd, one move will be left, which means the final number of cubes will be 1, not 0. Therefore, the correct answer should be "No".

**Counterexample:**
- Input: `1 0 1`
  - Expected Output: `No`
  - Actual Output: `Yes` (because `(1 - 0) % 2 == 0` and `1 - 0 >= 0`)

Thus, the program is incorrect for the case where `n` is odd and `m` is 0.
