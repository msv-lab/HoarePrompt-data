Let's evaluate the program based on the provided problem description, code, and function summary.

### Problem Description Recap
Nikita can perform one of two operations:
1. Add exactly 1 cube to the tower.
2. Remove exactly 1 cube from the tower.

The goal is to determine if, after `n` moves, the tower can have exactly `m` cubes.

### Key Observations
1. **Parity of Moves**: Since each move changes the parity of the number of cubes, the number of moves `n` and the final number of cubes `m` must have the same parity (both even or both odd).
2. **Minimum Moves Required**: The number of moves `n` must be at least `m` because you can't remove more cubes than you have initially (starting from 0 cubes).

### Program Analysis
The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`. It then checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Verification of Conditions
1. **Parity Condition**: `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that `n` and `m` have the same parity.
2. **Minimum Moves Condition**: `n - m >= 0` ensures that the number of moves `n` is at least the number of cubes `m`.

### Function Summary Recap
The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input for each test case. It prints 'Yes' if the difference `n - m` is even and non-negative; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the parity and minimum moves conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Evaluation
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly checks both the parity condition and the minimum moves condition to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.

**Reasoning:** The program correctly checks both the parity condition and the minimum moves condition to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.
**Final:** **True**
