The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. This output is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, and `m` as described in the initial state. The conditions provided in the initial state (such as the range of `t`, `n`, and `m`, and the condition on `n - m`) do not affect the content of the `print` statement.

Thus, the `print` statement will simply output the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
