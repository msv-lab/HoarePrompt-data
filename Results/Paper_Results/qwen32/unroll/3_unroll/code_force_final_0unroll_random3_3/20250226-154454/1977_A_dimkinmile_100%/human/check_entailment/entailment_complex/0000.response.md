### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove one cube. The key insight is that the difference between the number of moves (`n`) and the number of cubes (`m`) at the end must be even and non-negative. This is because:

- If `n - m` is even, it means the number of additions and subtractions must balance out in such a way that the net effect is a valid sequence of moves.
- If `n - m` is non-negative, it means the number of moves is sufficient to reach `m` cubes (since you can't have a negative number of moves).

The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`. It then checks if `n - m` is even and non-negative. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Correctness:
Given the logic explained above, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It correctly determines if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves by checking if `n - m` is even and non-negative. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
