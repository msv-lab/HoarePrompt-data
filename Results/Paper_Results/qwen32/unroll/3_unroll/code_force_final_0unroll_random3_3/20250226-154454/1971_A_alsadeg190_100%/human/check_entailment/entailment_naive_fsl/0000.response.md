Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`. It correctly identifies the minimum and maximum of the two integers and prints them in the required order. The logic used in the code is straightforward and handles all the edge cases mentioned in the problem description. For example, when `x` and `y` are equal, it correctly prints the same number twice, as seen in the test cases `3 3` and `0 0`. There are no potential cases where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description.
