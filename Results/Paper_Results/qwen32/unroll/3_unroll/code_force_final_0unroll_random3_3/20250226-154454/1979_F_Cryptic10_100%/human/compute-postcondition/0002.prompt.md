Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func()` is designed to interactively determine a Hamiltonian path in a graph. The graph starts as a complete undirected graph with `n` vertices (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and then has exactly (n - 2) edges removed. The function can make at most `n` queries of the form "? d" to gather information about the graph's structure, where `d` is an integer (0 ≤ d ≤ n - 1). The function should output a Hamiltonian path in the format "! v_1 v_2 ... v_n" after processing the queries. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The lambda function `q` is defined to perform queries but has not been called.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    vx, ops = set(i for i in range(1, int(input()) + 1)), []
    while len(vx) > 2:
        v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
        vx.remove(v1)
        if v2 > 0:
            ops += [(v1, v2)]
        else:
            v3, _ = q(0)
            vx.remove(v3)
            ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]
    p1, p2 = list(vx), []
    for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
        (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)
    print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
