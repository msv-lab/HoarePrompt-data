The provided code snippet defines a lambda function `q` that takes an integer `d` and performs two actions:
1. It prints a query string in the format "? d" to the standard output.
2. It reads a line of input from the standard input, splits it into integers, and returns them as a map object.

Since the function `q` is defined but not called, the state of the program does not change in terms of any variable assignments or computations. The function `func()`, which is mentioned in the initial state, is not executed, and no queries are made to the graph.

Output State: **The function `func()` is designed to interactively determine a Hamiltonian path in a graph. The graph starts as a complete undirected graph with `n` vertices (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and then has exactly (n - 2) edges removed. The function can make at most `n` queries of the form "? d" to gather information about the graph's structure, where `d` is an integer (0 ≤ d ≤ n - 1). The function should output a Hamiltonian path in the format "! v_1 v_2 ... v_n" after processing the queries. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The lambda function `q` is defined to perform queries but has not been called.**
