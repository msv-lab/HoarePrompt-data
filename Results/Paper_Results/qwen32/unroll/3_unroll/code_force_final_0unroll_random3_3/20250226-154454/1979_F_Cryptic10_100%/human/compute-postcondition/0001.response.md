In the given task, the for loop is iterating over a range determined by the integer input. The loop head contains the variable `_` and the range function, which depends on the input value. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value that determines the number of iterations.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
2. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable that is not used in the loop body, so it does not need to be adjusted.
3. The range function depends on the integer value obtained from `int(input())`. This value determines how many times the loop will execute.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to provide an input value that is a positive integer. Since the problem statement does not specify a particular number of test cases, we can assume that the input will be a positive integer that represents the number of test cases.

State: **The input to the function must be a positive integer representing the number of test cases.**

Since the problem does not provide any specific initial state for other variables or objects involved in the loop body, we only need to adjust the input to ensure the loop can execute the correct number of times.
