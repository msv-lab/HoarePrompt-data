Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program aims to find the minimum number of elements to remove so that the array stops being beautiful, but the logic implemented does not achieve this goal.

Here's the breakdown of the issues:
1. The program calculates the minimum length of any contiguous subarray that contains only the first element of the array `a`. This does not directly help in determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
2. The program checks if all elements in the array are the same and outputs `-1` in that case, which is correct. However, the approach to finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed.
3. The program does not consider all possible scenarios for making the array non-beautiful. It only looks at contiguous subarrays starting with the first element, which is not sufficient to find the optimal solution.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should consider different strategies for making the array non-beautiful, such as removing elements to break the pattern of the operation described in the problem.

Correctness: **False**
