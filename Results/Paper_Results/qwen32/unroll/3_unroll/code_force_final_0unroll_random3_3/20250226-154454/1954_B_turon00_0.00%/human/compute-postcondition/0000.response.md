The code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4. After executing the code, `t` will hold the specific integer value that was input, and the other conditions about `n` and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= n, the array a is beautiful, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
