Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program attempts to find the minimum sequence of consecutive identical elements and then outputs the length of that sequence, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

The task is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array no longer beautiful. The current program does not consider the condition that allows the array to remain beautiful (i.e., the possibility to replace an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\)) and does not correctly calculate the minimum number of removals required.

Here's a brief outline of what the correct approach should be:
1. Identify the longest subsequence of elements that can be made uniform by the given operation.
2. Calculate the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break this subsequence.

The given solution does not implement this logic and thus is incorrect.
