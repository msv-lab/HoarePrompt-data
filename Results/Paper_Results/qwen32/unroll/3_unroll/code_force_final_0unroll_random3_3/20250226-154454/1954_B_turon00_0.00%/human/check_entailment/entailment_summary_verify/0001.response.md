Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful.
- A beautiful array can be transformed into a uniform array using a specific operation.
- If all elements are the same, it is impossible to make it non-beautiful, so the answer should be `-1`.
- Otherwise, we need to find the smallest contiguous segment of identical elements that, if removed, would break the ability to transform the array into a uniform array.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads multiple test cases and processes each array as follows:
1. It checks if all elements are the same by converting the array to a set and checking its length. If the length of the set is 1, it prints `-1`.
2. If the array is not uniform, it tries to find the minimum length of contiguous subarrays that contain only the first element of the array.

### Function Summary:
The function summary states that the program determines the minimum length of any contiguous subarray that contains only the first element of the array `a`. If all elements in the array are the same, it outputs `-1`.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Uniform Array**: The program correctly identifies if the array is uniform and outputs `-1`.
2. **Non-Uniform Array**: The program tries to find the minimum length of contiguous subarrays that contain only the first element. However, this approach does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

### Flaws in the Program:
- The program only considers contiguous subarrays that contain only the first element. This is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
- The problem requires finding the smallest contiguous segment of identical elements that, if removed, would break the ability to transform the array into a uniform array. This could involve any segment of identical elements, not just those starting with the first element.

### Example:
Consider the test case:
```
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
The program will find the minimum length of contiguous subarrays that contain only the first element (`1`), which is `1`. However, removing a single `1` does not make the array non-beautiful. The correct answer is `1`, but the program's logic to determine this is flawed.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the smallest segment of identical elements that, if removed, would break the ability to transform the array into a uniform array. This involves checking all segments of identical elements and determining the minimum number of elements to remove.

### Conclusion:
Given the program's logic, it does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful for all cases. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **False**
