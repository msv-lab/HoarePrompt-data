The only variable in the loop head of the provided `for` loop is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python idiom for a loop variable that we do not plan to use. The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will execute `t` times. The state before the loop starts should ensure that `t` is a valid integer within the specified range (1 <= t <= 10^4).

Since the loop head does not involve any other variables that need to be explicitly adjusted, and the loop variable `_` is not used within the loop body, we only need to ensure that `t` is correctly set.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
