To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, let's analyze the code step-by-step:

1. **Outer Loop (`for _ in range(t)`):**
   - This loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, a new integer `n` is read.

2. **Inner Loop (`for i in range(1, n + 1)`):**
   - This loop runs `n` times for each test case.
   - It calculates `sum` and `r` based on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
   - If the condition is true, `r` is set to `i` and `sum` is incremented by `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
   - Otherwise, `sum` is incremented by `i * n`.

3. **Printing the Result:**
   - After the inner loop, `sum` and `n + r` are printed.
   - Another loop (`for j in range(1, n + r + 1)`) runs to print additional information.

4. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - `r` is updated to the last `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true.
   - `sum` accumulates values based on the condition.

5. **Output Format:**
   - For each test case, the output consists of:
     - `sum` and `n + r` printed on a single line.
     - `n + r` lines of additional information.

Given the nature of the loop and the calculations, the final output state will consist of the results for all test cases concatenated.

**Output State:** **The output state consists of `t` blocks, where each block contains:**
- The first line of each block is `sum` and `n + r` for that test case.
- The following `n + r` lines describe the matrix operations, with each line starting with either `1` or `2` followed by the row index and the row values from `1` to `n`.

Since the specific values of `t` and `n` for each test case are not provided, we cannot compute exact numerical values for `sum` and `r`. However, the format and structure of the output are clear.
