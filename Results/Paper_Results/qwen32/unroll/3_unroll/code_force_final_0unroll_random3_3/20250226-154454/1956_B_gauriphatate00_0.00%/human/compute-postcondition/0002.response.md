The code snippet provided initializes a variable `idx` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `n`, `a`, `input`, and `data` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of cards each player receives, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `input` is `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `idx` is 0.**
