The code snippet provided initializes an empty list called `results`. No other variables are modified. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of cards each player receives, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `input` is `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `idx` is 1, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `results` is an empty list.**
