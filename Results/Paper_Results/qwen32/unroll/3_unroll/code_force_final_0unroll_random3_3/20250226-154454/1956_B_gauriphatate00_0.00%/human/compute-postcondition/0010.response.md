Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of cards each player receives, and a parameter `a`, which is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times. The function returns a list indicating the distribution of cards to players such that each player receives `n` cards. If such a distribution is not possible, it returns an error message indicating the impossibility.**
