Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
- **Objective**: Determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally, given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
- **Game Rules**:
  - Each player has `n` cards.
  - Each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice in the deck.
  - Players take turns placing cards on the table.
  - A player earns a point if the card they place matches an already placed card.
  - Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

### Program Analysis
The program consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1(n, a)`**: This function calculates the maximum number of points you can get given `n` and your list of cards `a`.
2. **`func_2()`**: This function reads input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### `func_1(n, a)` Analysis
- **Logic**:
  - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each card in your hand.
  - It calculates the number of pairs in your hand (`pairs`), i.e., cards that appear exactly twice.
  - It returns the minimum of `pairs` and `n // 2`. This is because:
    - You can score at most `pairs` points if all your pairs match cards already on the table.
    - Nene will always try to minimize your points, so you can score at most `n // 2` points (since there are `n` turns for each player).

### `func_2()` Analysis
- **Logic**:
  - It reads multiple test cases from standard input.
  - For each test case, it calls `func_1` and stores the result.
  - It prints the results for all test cases.

### Correctness Evaluation
- **Logic Validity**:
  - The logic in `func_1` seems correct. The key insight is that the maximum points you can get is limited by the number of pairs you have and the fact that there are `n` turns for each player.
  - The function correctly calculates the number of pairs and ensures that the result does not exceed `n // 2`.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - **No Pairs**: If there are no pairs in your hand, the function correctly returns `0`.
  - **All Pairs**: If all cards in your hand are pairs, the function returns `n // 2`, which is the maximum possible points you can get.
  - **Mixed Cases**: If some cards are pairs and some are not, the function correctly returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for all potential cases. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where the program would fail to produce the correct result.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**.
