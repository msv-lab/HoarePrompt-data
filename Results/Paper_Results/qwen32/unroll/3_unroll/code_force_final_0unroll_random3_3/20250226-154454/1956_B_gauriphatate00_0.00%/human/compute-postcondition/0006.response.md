The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted, the only variable we need to consider is `t`.

The loop will execute `t` times. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `input`, `data`, `idx`, and `results`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of cards each player receives, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `input` is `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `idx` is 1, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list**
