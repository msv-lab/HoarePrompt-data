Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program attempts to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue, but it does not correctly account for the cost of moving past people who are already in positions that Kirill wants to reach. Specifically, the program does not properly handle the cost of moving past people between `j` and `i` when swapping positions, and it does not ensure that Kirill ends up in one of the first `m` positions with the minimum cost.

The logic in the program is flawed, and it does not guarantee the correct minimum cost for Kirill to reach one of the first `m` positions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
