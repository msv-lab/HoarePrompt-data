Reasoning:  
The provided program logic is almost correct but there is a typo in the output string for the "STAIR" condition. The program is supposed to print "STAIR" when the condition `a < b < c` is met, but it mistakenly prints "STAIRS" instead. This typo makes the program incorrect according to the problem description, which specifies that the output strings should be "STAIR", "PEAK", and "NONE" without any variations.

Correctness: **False**
