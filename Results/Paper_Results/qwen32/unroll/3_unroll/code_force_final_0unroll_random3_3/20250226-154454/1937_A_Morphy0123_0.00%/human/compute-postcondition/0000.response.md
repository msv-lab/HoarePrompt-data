Output State: **The function accepts no arguments but reads input from standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) representing the length of the array `a`. `n_cases` is assigned the value of the first integer read from the input.**

In simpler terms, the variable `n_cases` now holds the number of test cases `t` read from the input. The other details about the input format remain unchanged.
