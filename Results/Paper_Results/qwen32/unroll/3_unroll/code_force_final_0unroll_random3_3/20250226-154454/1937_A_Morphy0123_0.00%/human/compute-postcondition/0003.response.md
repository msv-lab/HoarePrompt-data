Functionality: **The function reads input from standard input, which includes multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each of the next `t` lines, the function reads a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) representing the length of an array `a`. The function does not accept any arguments directly. The function returns nothing explicitly, but it is implied that it processes each `n` and could potentially output results based on the processing of each test case.**
