You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

Output

    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) where a_i is the number of stones in the i-th pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The game described is a variant of the Nim game, where players remove a positive integer number of stones from each non-empty pile, with the constraint that the number of stones removed from each pile must be the same. The player who cannot make a move loses. The key to solving this problem lies in the observation that the game state can be analyzed using the concept of the Nim-sum (XOR-sum of the pile sizes).

However, the problem can be simplified by observing the following:
- If there is at least one pile with exactly 1 stone, Alice will always lose if both play optimally. This is because Bob can always mirror Alice's moves until Alice is forced to take the last stone from the pile of 1.
- If there are no piles with exactly 1 stone, Alice will always win. This is because she can always make a move that leaves Bob in a losing position.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to determine the winner based on the above observations:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        e = set(l)
        m = len(l)
        if 1 in l:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the number of piles `n`.
   - It reads the list of stones in each pile `l`.
   - It creates a set `e` from the list `l`. This set is not used anywhere in the program, so it is redundant.
   - It checks if `1` is in the list `l`.
   - If `1` is in `l`, it prints "Bob".
   - Otherwise, it prints "Alice".

### Correctness:
The program correctly identifies the winner based on the presence of a pile with exactly 1 stone. If there is at least one pile with 1 stone, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This matches the simplified winning condition derived from the problem analysis.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
