The code snippet assigns the value `n - 1` to the variable `right`. The value of `n` is the length of the list `arr`, which is specified to be between 2 and 100. The other variables (`t`, `arr`, `new_arr`, and `left`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; for each of the t test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `new_arr` is an empty list; `left` is 0; `right` is `n - 1`.**
