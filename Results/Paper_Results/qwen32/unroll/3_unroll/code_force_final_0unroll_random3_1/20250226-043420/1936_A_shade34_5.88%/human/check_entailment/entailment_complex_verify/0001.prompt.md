You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

    #State: mak2 is the index of the largest element in the permutation p, and mak is the index of the smallest among the largest elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a permutation `p` of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. For each test case, it outputs two indices: the index of the largest element in the permutation and the index of the smallest element among those that are the largest.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized. The XOR operation between two numbers is maximized when the numbers have the most differing bits. The program uses a series of queries to gather information about the permutation \(p\) and then determines the indices based on the responses.

### Program Explanation
1. **Initialization**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the value of \(n\).
   - `mak` is initialized to 0, which is the first index we consider as a candidate for the index with the maximum value in the permutation.

2. **First Loop**:
   - The program iterates from 1 to \(n-1\) and compares the bitwise OR of the element at `mak` with itself (`p_mak | p_mak`) to the bitwise OR of the element at the current index `i` with itself (`p_i | p_i`).
   - If the result of the comparison is `<`, it means `p_i` is greater than `p_mak`, so `mak` is updated to `i`.
   - This loop aims to find the index `mak` such that `p_mak` is the maximum element in the permutation.

3. **Second Loop**:
   - The program initializes `mak2` to `mak` and `pans` to an empty list.
   - It iterates over all indices from 0 to \(n-1\) and compares the bitwise OR of `p_mak` with itself to the bitwise OR of the element at the current index `i` with `p_mak2`.
   - If the result is `<`, it means `p_i` is greater than `p_mak`, so `mak` is updated to `i` and `pans` is reset to `[i]`.
   - If the result is `=`, it means `p_i` is equal to `p_mak`, so `i` is added to `pans`.
   - This loop collects all indices that have the maximum value in the permutation into the list `pans`.

4. **Third Loop**:
   - The program resets `mak` to 0.
   - It iterates over the indices in `pans` and compares the bitwise OR of the element at `pans[mak]` with itself to the bitwise OR of the element at the current index `i` in `pans` with itself.
   - If the result is `>`, it means `p_ans[mak]` is greater than `p_ans[i]`, so `mak` is updated to `i`.
   - This loop is intended to find the index `mak` such that `p_ans[mak]` is the maximum element among the indices in `pans`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result as `! mak2 mak`, which should be two indices such that their XOR is maximized.

### Issues in the Program
- **Incorrect Handling of `mak2`**: The variable `mak2` is set to `mak` at the beginning of the second loop, but it is not used correctly. The program should keep track of the indices that have the maximum value and then find the pair with the maximum XOR among them.
- **Incorrect Comparison Logic**: The comparison logic in the third loop is incorrect. The goal is to find the pair of indices with the maximum XOR, not to find the maximum element among the indices in `pans`.

### Correctness
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the pair of indices with the maximum XOR. The logic for finding the maximum XOR pair is flawed, and the program does not ensure that it finds the correct pair within the allowed number of queries.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
