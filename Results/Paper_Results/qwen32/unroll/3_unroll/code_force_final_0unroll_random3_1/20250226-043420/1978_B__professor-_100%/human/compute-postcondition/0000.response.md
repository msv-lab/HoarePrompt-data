The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Given the initial state, `t` was already defined as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. After executing the code, `t` will be updated to the value provided by the input, which is still within the same range. The other variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, read from input; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.**
