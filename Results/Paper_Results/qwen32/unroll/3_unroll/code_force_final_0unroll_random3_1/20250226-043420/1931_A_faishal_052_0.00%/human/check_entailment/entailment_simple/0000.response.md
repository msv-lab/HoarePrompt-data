### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to decode an encoded integer back into the lexicographically smallest three-letter word. The program reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads an integer `n` (the encoded word). It then attempts to determine the three letters by distributing the integer value across three positions, ensuring the smallest possible lexicographical order.

However, there are several issues in the given program that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Distribution Logic**: The program incorrectly handles the distribution of the integer `lex` across the three positions. It uses a hardcoded approach for the first two positions and then assigns the remaining value to the third position. This approach does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word.

2. **Sorting**: After assigning values to the array `arr`, the program sorts it. Sorting is unnecessary and incorrect because it disrupts the intended distribution of values to achieve the smallest lexicographical order.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when the integer `lex` is exactly 3 or 78. The current logic may not produce the correct result in these cases.

### Correctness:

Given the issues mentioned above, the provided program is not correct. Therefore, the answer is:

**Correctness: False**
