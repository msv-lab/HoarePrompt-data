Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded sum. Let's analyze the program and find a case where it fails.

The program constructs the word by first determining the values of the first two letters and then setting the third letter to the remaining value. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. If the encoded sum (`lex`) is less than or equal to 26, it assigns 1 to the first two letters and the remaining value to the third letter.
2. If the encoded sum is less than 52 but greater than 26, it assigns 26 to the first letter, 1 to the second letter, and the remaining value to the third letter.
3. If the encoded sum is 52 or greater, it assigns 26 to the first two letters and the remaining value to the third letter.

After determining the values, it sorts the list of values and converts them to characters.

Let's consider a test case where the encoded sum is 28. The correct lexicographically smallest word should be "aab" (1 + 1 + 26). However, the program will produce "abc" (1 + 2 + 25) because it always assigns 26 to the first letter if the sum is 52 or greater after considering the first two letters.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown for the test case with `lex = 28`:

1. The program assigns 26 to the first letter, 1 to the second letter, and the remaining value (28 - 27 = 1) to the third letter.
2. The list `[26, 1, 1]` is sorted to `[1, 1, 26]`.
3. The characters are `['a', 'a', 'z']`, resulting in the word "aaz".

Thus, the program does not always produce the correct lexicographically smallest word. A correct approach should involve assigning the smallest possible values to the first two letters while ensuring the sum of all three letters equals the encoded sum.
