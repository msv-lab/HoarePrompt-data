Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that corresponds to a given encoded sum. The encoded sum is the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet. For example, the word "cat" encodes to 24 (3 + 1 + 20). The goal is to find the smallest possible word (in lexicographical order) that could result in this sum.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`cases`).
   - For each test case, it reads an integer (`lex`), which represents the encoded sum.

2. **Generating the Word:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
   - It then enters a loop that runs twice to fill the first two positions of the word:
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 1 to `arr` (representing 'a') and reduces `lex` by 1.
     - If `lex` is greater than 26 but less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` (representing 'z') and reduces `lex` by 26.
     - Otherwise, it also appends 26 to `arr` (representing 'z') and reduces `lex` by 26.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr` (representing the third letter).

3. **Sorting and Printing:**
   - The program sorts the list `arr` to ensure the letters are in lexicographical order.
   - It then converts each number in `arr` to its corresponding letter (by adding 96 to the number and converting it to a character) and prints them.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Handling of Values:**
  - The program's logic for handling values of `lex` is flawed. For example, if `lex` is 78, the correct word should be "rzz" (18 + 26 + 26), but the program will incorrectly handle the values and may not produce the correct result.
- **Logic for Lexicographical Order:**
  - The sorting step is not needed if the program correctly generates the letters in the first place. The goal is to generate the smallest possible letters first, which is not guaranteed by this approach.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle the smallest possible sum (3, corresponding to "aaa") correctly.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
