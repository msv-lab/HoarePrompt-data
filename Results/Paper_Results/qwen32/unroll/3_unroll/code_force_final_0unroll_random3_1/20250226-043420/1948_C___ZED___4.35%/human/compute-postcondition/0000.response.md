In the provided code snippet, the for loop iterates based on the integer value `t` which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `i` and the function `input()`. Since `t` is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) before the loop starts, the only variable we can adjust in the loop head is `i`.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1, which it already is according to the problem statement. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts, so we do not need to adjust its value before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state does not need to be modified further as per the loop head's requirements.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` will be 0 when the loop starts**
