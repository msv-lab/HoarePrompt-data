You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    #State: - The output state consists of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions mentioned above.
    #   - The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are modified during each iteration of the loop, but the final output state is determined by the printed results for each test case.
    #
    #Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the output state will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each test case.
    #
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two strings of equal even length containing '<' and/or '>' characters. For each test case, it determines whether it's possible to match each '>' in the second string with a '<' in the first string such that each pair of matched characters are facing each other. The function outputs 'YES' if such a matching is possible for a test case and 'NO' otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. **Handling of the last column in the second row:**
   ```python
   if b[-2] != '>':
       print('NO')
   ```
   The code checks if the second-to-last arrow in the second row is not pointing to the right (`>`). If it's not, the robot cannot reach the final cell (2, n). However, this check is insufficient because the robot can potentially reach the final cell even if the second-to-last arrow in the second row is not pointing to the right, depending on the arrows in the first row and the overall grid configuration.

2. **Handling of the first column:**
   ```python
   elif n == 1:
       print('YES')
   ```
   This condition is incorrect because `n` is guaranteed to be at least 2 (as per the problem statement). Hence, this condition will never be true.

3. **Checking alternating columns in the second row:**
   ```python
   no_path = True
   for k in range(0, n, 2):
       if b[k] != '>':
           no_path = False
   ```
   This loop checks if all even-indexed columns in the second row have arrows pointing to the right. If not, `no_path` is set to `False`. However, this check is not sufficient because the robot can move up or down between rows, and the arrows in the first row can affect the robot's ability to reach the final cell.

4. **Checking alternating columns in the first row:**
   ```python
   if not no_path:
       no_path = True
       for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
           print(k)
           if a[k] != '>':
               no_path = False
   ```
   This loop checks if all odd-indexed columns in the first row have arrows pointing to the right. If not, `no_path` is set to `False`. Similar to the previous check, this is not sufficient because the robot can move up or down between rows, and the arrows in the second row can affect the robot's ability to reach the final cell.

5. **Printing the result:**
   ```python
   if no_path:
       print('YES')
   else:
       print('NO')
   ```
   The final result is printed based on the `no_path` flag. However, the logic leading to the setting of `no_path` is incorrect, as discussed above.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the robot's movement based on the arrows in both rows and ensure that it can reach the final cell (2, n). The current logic does not account for all possible paths and configurations, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
4
><<>
><<>
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

In this example, the robot can start at (1, 1), move to (2, 1), then to (2, 2), then to (1, 2), then to (1, 3), then to (2, 3), and finally to (2, 4). However, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" because it does not correctly simulate the robot's movement.
