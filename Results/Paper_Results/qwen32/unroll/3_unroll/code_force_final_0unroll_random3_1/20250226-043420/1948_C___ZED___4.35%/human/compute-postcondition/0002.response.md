For each test case, it accepts two strings of equal even length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of a grid. The function returns the number of pairs of arrows that can be matched between the two rows such that each pair consists of one '<' and one '>' facing each other.**
