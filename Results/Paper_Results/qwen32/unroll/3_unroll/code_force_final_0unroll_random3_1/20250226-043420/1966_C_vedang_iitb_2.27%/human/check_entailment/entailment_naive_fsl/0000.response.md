Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the provided problem description. The program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which do not directly address the game rules or provide a correct implementation to determine the winner.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function appears to be trying to calculate some differences between the sorted unique elements of the list `a`. However, it does not seem to be directly related to the game logic. The purpose of this function is unclear and it does not contribute to determining the winner.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function attempts to determine the winner based on the number of piles `n` and the stones in the piles `a`. However, the logic implemented in this function does not correctly simulate the game or follow the rules provided in the problem description.

Let's consider a specific test case to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

**Test Case:**
```
Input:
1
3
1 2 3

Expected Output:
Alice
```

**Explanation of the Test Case:**
- Alice can choose `k=1` on her first turn, reducing the piles to `[0, 1, 2]`.
- Bob then chooses `k=1`, reducing the piles to `[0, 0, 1]`.
- Alice chooses `k=1`, reducing the piles to `[0, 0, 0]`.
- Bob cannot make a move, so Alice wins.

However, the provided function `func_2` does not correctly handle this scenario. The function `func_2` seems to be using some form of recursive logic that does not accurately simulate the game rules, particularly the optimal moves for both players.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine the winner for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
