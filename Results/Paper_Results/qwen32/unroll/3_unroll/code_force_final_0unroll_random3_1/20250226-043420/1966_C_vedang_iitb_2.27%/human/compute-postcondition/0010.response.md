Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of piles such that `n == len(a)`, `n` is not equal to 1 and `n` is not equal to 2. `winNext` is the value returned by `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`. The current value of `winNext` is either 2 or (1 and the first element of `a` is not 1).**
