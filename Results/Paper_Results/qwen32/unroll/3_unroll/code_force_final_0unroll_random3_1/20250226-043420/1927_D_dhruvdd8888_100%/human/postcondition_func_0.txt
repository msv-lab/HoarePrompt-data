The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array and a set of queries. For each query, it determines and prints a pair of indices based on the segments of identical numbers within the array. Specifically, for each query defined by boundaries `l` and `r`, it identifies the segment of identical numbers within the specified range and returns the start and end indices of that segment, or `-1 -1` if no such segment exists.
