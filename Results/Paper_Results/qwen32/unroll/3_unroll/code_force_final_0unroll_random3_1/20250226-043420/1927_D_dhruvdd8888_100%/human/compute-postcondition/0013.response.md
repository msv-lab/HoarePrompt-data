Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a`, followed by `n` integers which are the elements of the array `a`. It also receives an integer `q` representing the number of queries, and for each query, it receives two integers `l` and `r` representing the boundaries of the query. The function returns the result of each query, which is not specified in the provided details but generally would involve some computation or retrieval based on the array `a` and the query boundaries `l` and `r`.**
