Let's break down the program and see if it correctly addresses the problem requirements.

### Problem Understanding:
For each query, we need to find two indices `i` and `j` within the range `[l, r]` such that `a[i] != a[j]`. If no such pair exists, we should return `-1 -1`.

### Program Analysis:
The program processes each test case by first reading the array and then processing each query. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `N`, the array elements `nums`, and the number of queries `q`.

2. **Compressing the Array:**
   - The program uses a list `arr` to store segments of the array where all elements are the same. Each segment is represented as a tuple `(start, end, value)`.
   - The program iterates through the array and identifies these segments. For example, if the array is `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`, the segments would be `[(1, 2, 1), (3, 3, 2), (4, 5, 1)]`.

3. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query `(l, r)`, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment that starts within the range `[l, r]`.
   - The program then checks if there is a valid pair of indices within the range `[l, r]` that satisfy the condition `a[i] != a[j]`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Segment Handling:**
   - The program incorrectly handles segments and does not correctly identify if a valid pair exists within the range `[l, r]`.
   - The conditions for printing `-1 -1` are not correctly defined. For example, if a segment starts after `l` and ends before `r`, it should not necessarily print `-1 -1`.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the range `[l, r]` contains only one segment correctly.
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where the segment ends exactly at `r`.

### Correctness:
Given the issues outlined above, the program does not correctly handle all cases and may produce incorrect results for certain inputs.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly identify valid pairs of indices for all queries and may incorrectly return `-1 -1` in scenarios where a valid pair exists.
