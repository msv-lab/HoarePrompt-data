Reasoning: 

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by first preprocessing the array to identify segments of identical numbers. It then uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to efficiently find the relevant segment for each query. However, there are several issues with the logic that make the implementation incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Segments**: The code tries to find a segment of identical numbers within the given range `[l, r]` and returns the start and end indices of that segment. However, the problem requires finding two different elements within the range, not just a segment of identical numbers.

2. **Logic Errors**:
    - The code does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple segments within the range `[l, r]`. It only checks the first segment found and does not ensure that the indices `i` and `j` correspond to different elements.
    - The conditions to print `-1 -1` are not correctly defined. For example, if the segment starts after `l`, it does not necessarily mean that no valid pair exists.
    - The code does not correctly handle the case where the segment ends before `r` and there might be another segment with a different element.

3. **Edge Cases**:
    - The code does not handle cases where the array has only one unique element or where all elements in the queried range are the same.
    - The code does not correctly handle the case where `l == r`, although the problem description specifies `1 ≤ l < r ≤ n`, so this might not be a concern based on the input constraints.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
