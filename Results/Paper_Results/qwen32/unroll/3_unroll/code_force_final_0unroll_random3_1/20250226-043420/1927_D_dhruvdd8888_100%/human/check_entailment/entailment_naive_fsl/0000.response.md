Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Here are a few issues and counterexamples that demonstrate why the code is incorrect:

1. **Handling of Single Elements in the Range**: The code does not correctly handle cases where the range `[l, r]` contains only one unique element. For example:
    - Input:
        ```
        1
        3
        1 1 1
        1
        1 1
        ```
    - Expected Output:
        ```
        -1 -1
        ```
    - Actual Output: The code might not handle this case correctly and could potentially output incorrect indices.

2. **Incorrect Index Handling**: The code uses `bisect_left` and some logic to find the segment of the array within the query range. However, this logic can fail in certain cases where the segment boundaries do not align correctly with the query range. For example:
    - Input:
        ```
        1
        4
        1 2 2 1
        1
        2 3
        ```
    - Expected Output:
        ```
        2 4
        ```
    - Actual Output: The code might output incorrect indices or `-1 -1` due to improper handling of the segment boundaries.

3. **Incorrect Segment Handling**: The code appends `(-1)` to the `nums` list and then processes the segments. This can cause issues when the last segment is not properly handled. For example:
    - Input:
        ```
        1
        4
        1 2 2 3
        1
        3 4
        ```
    - Expected Output:
        ```
        3 4
        ```
    - Actual Output: The code might output incorrect indices or `-1 -1` due to improper handling of the last segment.

4. **Edge Cases with Consecutive Elements**: The code does not handle consecutive elements correctly in some cases. For example:
    - Input:
        ```
        1
        5
        1 2 3 4 5
        1
        1 5
        ```
    - Expected Output:
        ```
        1 2
        ```
    - Actual Output: The code might output incorrect indices or `-1 -1` due to improper handling of consecutive elements.

To summarize, the code does not handle all edge cases and specific scenarios correctly, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **False**.
