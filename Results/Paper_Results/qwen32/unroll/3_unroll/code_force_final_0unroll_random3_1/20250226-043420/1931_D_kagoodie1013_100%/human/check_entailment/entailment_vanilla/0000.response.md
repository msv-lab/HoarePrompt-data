Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array `a` for each test case. A pair of indices `<i, j>` is considered beautiful if:
1. `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
2. `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution uses a dictionary (`residue_map`) to keep track of the frequency of pairs of residues `(num % x, num % y)` as it iterates through the array. The key idea is to use these residues to determine if a pair is beautiful.

1. **Residue Calculation:**
   - For each number `num` in the array, compute `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`.
   - The pair `(r_x, r_y)` is used to check how many previous numbers could form a beautiful pair with the current number based on the conditions provided.

2. **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
   - For each number, the solution checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` exists in the dictionary `residue_map`. If it does, it means there are previous numbers that can form a beautiful pair with the current number, and the count is incremented by the frequency of that pair.
   - After checking, the current residue pair `(num % x, num % y)` is added to the dictionary, and its frequency is updated.

### Correctness Verification:
The provided solution is correct because:
- It correctly computes the residues required to check the conditions for a beautiful pair.
- It efficiently counts the number of beautiful pairs using a dictionary to store and look up the frequencies of the residue pairs.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the solution with the first test case from the example:
- Input: `n = 6`, `x = 5`, `y = 2`, `a = [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6]`
- Beautiful pairs: `<1, 5>` and `<4, 6>`
- The solution correctly identifies these pairs and returns the count `2`.

### Conclusion:
The solution correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. Thus, the solution is correct.

Correctness: **True**
