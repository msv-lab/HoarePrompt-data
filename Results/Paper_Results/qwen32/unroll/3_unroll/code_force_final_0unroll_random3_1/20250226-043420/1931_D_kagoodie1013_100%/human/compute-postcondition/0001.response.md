In the given task, the for loop iterates over `test_cases`, which is a list of test cases. Each test case is a tuple containing four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one such tuple.

The state of `results` being an empty list does not affect whether the loop will execute, as it is not part of the loop head. Therefore, we only need to ensure that `test_cases` contains at least one test case.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a tuple containing three integers (n, x, y) and a list of integers a, and `test_cases` must contain at least one such tuple; `results` is an empty list.**

This ensures that the for loop will execute at least once.
