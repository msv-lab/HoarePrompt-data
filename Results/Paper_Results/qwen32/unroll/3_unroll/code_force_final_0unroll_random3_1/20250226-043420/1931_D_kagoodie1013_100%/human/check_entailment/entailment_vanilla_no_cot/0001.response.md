Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find pairs of indices \( \langle i, j \rangle \) in an array \( a \) such that:
  - \( a_i + a_j \) is divisible by \( x \),
  - \( a_i - a_j \) is divisible by \( y \).
- The task is to count how many such pairs exist for each test case.

### Key Observations:
- For \( a_i + a_j \) to be divisible by \( x \), \( (a_i \mod x) + (a_j \mod x) \equiv 0 \mod x \).
- For \( a_i - a_j \) to be divisible by \( y \), \( (a_i \mod y) - (a_j \mod y) \equiv 0 \mod y \), which simplifies to \( a_i \equiv a_j \mod y \).

### Approach in the Code:
- The code uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the count of pairs of residues \((a_i \mod x, a_i \mod y)\).
- For each element in the array, it calculates the required residues:
  - \( r_x = -a_i \mod x \) (which is equivalent to \((x - a_i \mod x) \mod x\))
  - \( r_y = a_i \mod y \)
- It then looks up how many pairs with residues \((r_x, r_y)\) have been seen so far in `residue_map` and adds this count to the total.
- Finally, it updates the `residue_map` with the current element's residues.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The logic for counting pairs based on residues is correct.
- The use of \(-a_i \mod x\) to find pairs where \( a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \mod x \) is also correct, as it ensures that the sum of residues is zero modulo \( x \).
- The program correctly handles multiple test cases and efficiently counts the number of beautiful pairs using a single pass through the array for each test case.
- The use of a dictionary to keep track of the residues ensures that the solution is efficient, with a time complexity of \( O(n) \) per test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as per the given constraints and requirements.

Correctness: **True**
