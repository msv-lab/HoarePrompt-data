Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to ensure the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find pairs of indices \((i, j)\) such that:
1. \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\)
2. \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\)

This can be rephrased using modular arithmetic as:
1. \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\)
2. \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\)

### Program Analysis

The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of pairs of residues \((r_x, r_y)\) where:
- \(r_x = -a_i \mod x\)
- \(r_y = a_i \mod y\)

For each number in the array, it calculates \(r_x\) and \(r_y\) and checks how many times the pair \((r_x, r_y)\) has been seen before. This count is added to the total count of beautiful pairs. The dictionary is then updated with the current number's residues.

### Annotations and Logic Validation

Let's look at the annotations and logic step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads multiple test cases and extracts the values of \(n\), \(x\), \(y\), and the array \(arr\).

2. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
   - **Initialization**: `residue_map` is initialized as an empty dictionary.
   - **Residue Calculation**: For each number in the array, the program calculates \(r_x = -a_i \mod x\) and \(r_y = a_i \mod y\).
   - **Counting**: The program checks how many times the pair \((r_x, r_y)\) has been seen before using `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` and adds this count to the total count of beautiful pairs.
   - **Updating Dictionary**: The dictionary is updated with the current number's residues.

### Verification

Let's verify the logic using a few test cases:

#### Test Case 1
- Input: \(n = 6\), \(x = 5\), \(y = 2\), \(arr = [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6]\)
- Expected Output: 2

For each element in the array:
- \(a_1 = 1\): \(r_x = -1 \mod 5 = 4\), \(r_y = 1 \mod 2 = 1\)
- \(a_2 = 2\): \(r_x = -2 \mod 5 = 3\), \(r_y = 2 \mod 2 = 0\)
- \(a_3 = 7\): \(r_x = -7 \mod 5 = 3\), \(r_y = 7 \mod 2 = 1\)
- \(a_4 = 4\): \(r_x = -4 \mod 5 = 1\), \(r_y = 4 \mod 2 = 0\)
- \(a_5 = 9\): \(r_x = -9 \mod 5 = 1\), \(r_y = 9 \mod 2 = 1\)
- \(a_6 = 6\): \(r_x = -6 \mod 5 = 4\), \(r_y = 6 \mod 2 = 0\)

The pairs \((4, 1)\) and \((3, 1)\) are seen twice, corresponding to the beautiful pairs \((1, 5)\) and \((4, 6)\).

#### Test Case 2
- Input: \(n = 7\), \(x = 9\), \(y = 5\), \(arr = [1, 10, 15, 3, 8, 12, 15]\)
- Expected Output: 0

For each element in the array:
- No pairs \((r_x, r_y)\) are repeated in a way that satisfies both conditions.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs using modular arithmetic and a dictionary to keep track of residue pairs. The logic is efficient and correctly handles the given constraints. The annotations confirm the program's behavior, and no edge cases were found that the program fails to handle correctly.

**Final: True**
