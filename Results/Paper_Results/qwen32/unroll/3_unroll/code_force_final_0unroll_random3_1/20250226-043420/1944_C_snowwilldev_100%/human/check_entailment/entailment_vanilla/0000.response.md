Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem involves a game played by Alice and Bob on an array `a` of size `n`. Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. Alice appends an element from `a` to array `c` and removes it from `a`, while Bob simply removes an element from `a` without adding it to `c`. The game ends when `a` is empty. The score of the game is the MEX of `c`, and Alice wants to maximize it while Bob wants to minimize it. We need to determine the final score if both players play optimally.

### Key Observations
1. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
2. **Optimal Play**:
    - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
    - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.
3. **Game Dynamics**:
    - Alice can force the MEX to be at least `k` if she can ensure that the first `k` non-negative integers are present in `c`.
    - Bob can prevent the MEX from being `k` if he can ensure that not all the first `k` non-negative integers are present in `c`.

### Strategy
- **Count Occurrences**: Count the occurrences of each number in `a`.
- **Determine MEX**:
    - If there are at least two numbers that appear exactly once in `a`, Alice can ensure that these numbers are in `c`, maximizing the MEX.
    - Otherwise, Bob can force the MEX to be lower by strategically removing elements.

### Code Analysis
Let's analyze the provided code to see if it correctly implements the above strategy.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
```

1. **Counting Occurrences**: The code correctly counts the occurrences of each number in `a` using a `defaultdict`.
2. **Determining MEX**:
    - The variable `t` counts the number of unique numbers that appear exactly once.
    - The loop iterates through numbers from `0` to `N` and checks the count of each number.
    - If a number appears exactly once, `t` is incremented.
    - If `t` reaches `2`, it means there are at least two numbers that appear exactly once, and the MEX is the current number `i`.
    - If a number does not appear in `a` (i.e., `cnt[i] == 0`), the MEX is the current number `i`.

### Correctness
The logic in the code correctly determines the MEX based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Here's the reasoning:
- If there are at least two numbers that appear exactly once, Alice can ensure that these numbers are in `c`, maximizing the MEX.
- If no such numbers exist, Bob can force the MEX to be lower by removing elements that would otherwise be unique.

Thus, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
