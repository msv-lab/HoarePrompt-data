You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        maxi = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                maxi = i
        arr = [0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                arr = [i]
            elif res == '=':
                arr.append(i)
        mini = arr[0]
        for item in arr[1:]:
            print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '>':
                mini = item
        print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)



- Function Summary: 
The function interacts with an external system to determine a pair of indices in a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1 such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices is maximized. For each test case, it outputs the indices that achieve this maximum XOR value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not guarantee that it will always find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized. Here's a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Finding the `maxi` index:**
   - The program iterates through all indices \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\) and compares \(p_{\text{maxi}} \mid p_{\text{maxi}}\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\). Since \(p_i \mid p_i = p_i\), this comparison is essentially checking which index has the highest value in the permutation \(p\). This step correctly identifies the index of the maximum value in the permutation, which is stored in `maxi`.

2. **Building the `arr` list:**
   - The program then builds a list `arr` of indices \(i\) such that \(p_{\text{maxi}} \mid p_0\) is less than or equal to \(p_{\text{maxi}} \mid p_i\). This comparison is flawed because \(p_{\text{maxi}} \mid p_0\) is always equal to \(p_{\text{maxi}}\) (since \(p_0 = 0\) and any number ORed with 0 is the number itself). Thus, the comparison simplifies to checking if \(p_{\text{maxi}}\) is less than or equal to \(p_{\text{maxi}} \mid p_i\), which is always true for any \(i\). This means `arr` will end up containing all indices from 1 to \(n-1\).

3. **Finding the `mini` index:**
   - The program then iterates through the `arr` list and compares \(p_{\text{mini}} \mid p_{\text{mini}}\) with \(p_{\text{mini}} \mid \text{item}\) for each item in `arr`. Similar to the previous step, this comparison simplifies to checking if \(p_{\text{mini}}\) is less than or equal to \(p_{\text{mini}} \mid \text{item}\), which is always true. This means `mini` will end up being the last index in `arr` that is compared, which is not necessarily the index that maximizes the XOR with `maxi`.

4. **Outputting the result:**
   - The program outputs `maxi` and `mini` as the indices that maximize the XOR. However, due to the flawed logic in building `arr` and finding `mini`, the indices `maxi` and `mini` do not guarantee that \(p_{\text{maxi}} \oplus p_{\text{mini}}\) is the maximum possible XOR value.

### Counterexample:
Consider the permutation \(p = [0, 3, 1, 2]\). The maximum XOR value is \(3 \oplus 1 = 2\) or \(3 \oplus 2 = 1 \oplus 2 = 3\). The program will identify `maxi` as 1 (since \(p_1 = 3\) is the maximum value). The `arr` list will contain all indices from 1 to 3. The `mini` index will be the last index in `arr` that is compared, which could be 2 or 3. However, the XOR of \(p_1 \oplus p_2 = 3 \oplus 1 = 2\) or \(p_1 \oplus p_3 = 3 \oplus 2 = 1\) is not the maximum possible XOR value of 3.

Thus, the program does not correctly identify the indices that maximize the XOR value in all cases, making it incorrect.
