Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program is not guaranteed to find the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized based on the given constraints and problem description. Here is a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Finding the maximum element (`maxi`)**:
   - The program correctly identifies the index `maxi` of the maximum element in the permutation by comparing `p_maxi` with `p_i` for all `i`. This part is correct.

2. **Finding candidates for the minimum element (`arr`)**:
   - The program then tries to find candidate indices `arr` such that `p_maxi | p_arr[0] == p_maxi | p_i` for all `i` in `arr`. This is intended to find elements that, when ORed with `p_maxi`, yield the same result as `p_maxi | p_arr[0]`. This is a reasonable strategy to narrow down potential candidates for the minimum element.
   
3. **Finding the minimum element (`mini`)**:
   - The program then tries to find the minimum element among the candidates `arr` by comparing `p_mini` with `p_item` for all `item` in `arr`. The comparison is done using `p_mini | p_mini` and `p_item | p_item`, which is incorrect. The correct comparison should be based on the XOR operation, not the OR operation. The goal is to find the element that, when XORed with `p_maxi`, gives the maximum result, not the element that is the minimum in terms of OR operation.

Given the goal is to maximize `p_i ⊕ p_j`, the correct approach should involve comparing `p_maxi ⊕ p_item` for all `item` in `arr` to find the `mini` that maximizes this value. The current program does not achieve this.

Here is a corrected version of the program that should work:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        maxi = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                maxi = i
        arr = [0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                arr = [i]
            elif res == '=':
                arr.append(i)
        mini = arr[0]
        max_xor = 0
        for item in arr:
            print('?', maxi, maxi, maxi, item, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '>':
                xor_value = (1 << 16) - 1  # This is a placeholder, actual value should be calculated
            elif res == '<':
                xor_value = 0  # This is a placeholder, actual value should be calculated
            else:
                xor_value = (1 << 16) - 1  # This is a placeholder, actual value should be calculated
            if xor_value > max_xor:
                max_xor = xor_value
                mini = item
        print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)

# Note: The above code is still a placeholder and needs the actual XOR value calculation.
```

This version of the program still needs the actual XOR value calculation, which would involve more sophisticated queries to the interactor. However, the logic is corrected to focus on maximizing the XOR value.
