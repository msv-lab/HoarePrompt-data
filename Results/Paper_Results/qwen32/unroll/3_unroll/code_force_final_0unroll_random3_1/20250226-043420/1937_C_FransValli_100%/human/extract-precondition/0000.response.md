Precondition: **There are multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a permutation p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1} of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The function can interactively query up to 3n times per test case to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of elements in the permutation, and must output a pair of indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.**
