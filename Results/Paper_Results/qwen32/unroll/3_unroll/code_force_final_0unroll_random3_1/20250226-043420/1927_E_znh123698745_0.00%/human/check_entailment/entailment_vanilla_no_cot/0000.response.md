Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not guarantee a k-level permutation for all test cases. The algorithm alternates between the smallest and largest remaining numbers, but this strategy does not ensure that the sums of any k-length subarrays will differ by no more than 1. 

To construct a k-level permutation, a more systematic approach is needed, such as alternating blocks of increasing and decreasing sequences, ensuring the sums of the k-length subarrays are balanced. The provided solution does not achieve this balance, and therefore, it is incorrect.
