The loop in the provided code is controlled by the variable `_` in the loop head, which iterates over the range defined by `int(input())`. This means that the loop will execute a number of times equal to the integer value read from the input.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state such that `int(input())` returns a positive integer. Given the problem statement, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), which means the loop will execute `t` times.

Since `t` is already defined in the state before the loop starts and it satisfies the condition \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we do not need to adjust `t` itself. However, we need to ensure that the input function returns `t` when called.

The state before the loop starts already provides the necessary information that `t` is within the valid range, so no further adjustments to `t` are needed. The loop will execute `t` times as expected.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**

Since the loop head only involves the variable `_` which iterates over `int(input())`, and we are given that `t` is the integer input that satisfies the condition, the state does not need further modification.

Final State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
