The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is already described as an input integer, we just need to ensure it meets the condition to enter the loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9**
