The value of `small_element` is assigned the value `left + 1`. The initial conditions for `left` and `right` remain unchanged, and `clique` is also unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr), `clique` is an integer representing the current clique number, and `small_element` is `left + 1`.**
