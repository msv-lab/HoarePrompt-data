### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and its functions step by step to determine if it meets the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
   - This function calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`, which is the minimum number of cliques needed to partition the graph based on the given constraints.
   - It initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of length `n`.
   - It then calls `make_array` for each segment of `arr` to fill it with values and assigns clique numbers to `cliquess`.
   - Finally, it prints the values in `arr`, the number of cliques, and the values in `cliquess`.

2. **Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`**:
   - This function fills a segment of `arr` from `left` to `right` with values such that the first half of the segment contains increasing values starting from `left + 1` and the second half contains decreasing values starting from `right + 1`.
   - It also assigns the same clique number to all elements in this segment in the `cliquess` array.

### Issues in the program:

- **Incorrect Assignment of Values to `arr`**:
  - The function `make_array` assigns values to `arr` in a way that does not guarantee that the resulting graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
  - Specifically, the values assigned to `arr` do not ensure that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` holds for all pairs of vertices within the same clique.

- **Incorrect Assignment of Clique Numbers**:
  - The function `make_array` assigns the same clique number to all elements in a segment of `arr` regardless of whether the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` holds for all pairs of vertices within that segment.
  - This can result in vertices within the same clique not being connected, which violates the definition of a clique.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The values assigned to `arr` and the clique numbers assigned to `cliquess` do not guarantee that the resulting graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques, and the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is not necessarily satisfied for all pairs of vertices within the same clique.

**Correctness: False**
