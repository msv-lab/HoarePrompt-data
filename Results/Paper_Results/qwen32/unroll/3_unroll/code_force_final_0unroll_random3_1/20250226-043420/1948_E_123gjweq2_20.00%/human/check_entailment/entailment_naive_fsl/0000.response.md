Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Global Variables:** The functions `func_1` and `make_array` use global variables `arr` and `cliquess` without defining them within the functions or passing them as parameters. This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Clique Number:** The calculation of the number of cliques (`cliques = ceil(n / k)`) is incorrect. The problem requires partitioning the graph into the minimum number of cliques based on the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`. The current approach does not guarantee the minimum number of cliques.

3. **Incomplete Implementation:** The function `make_array` does not fully implement the logic to assign values to vertices and partition them into cliques based on the given condition. It simply assigns values in a specific order without checking the condition for each pair of vertices.

4. **Output Format:** The function `func_1` prints the results directly, which is not appropriate in a function context. The results should be returned and printed in the main part of the code or handled in a way that allows for multiple test cases.

5. **Lack of Loop for Multiple Test Cases:** The provided code does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. It only processes a single test case.

To make the code correct, it should:
- Define and use local variables within the functions.
- Correctly calculate the number of cliques based on the given condition.
- Implement the logic to assign values to vertices and partition them into cliques based on the condition.
- Return the results instead of printing them directly.
- Handle multiple test cases.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
from math import ceil

def solve(n, k):
    # Assign values to vertices
    arr = list(range(1, n + 1))
    cliques = []
    
    # Create cliques based on the condition
    for i in range(n):
        found_clique = False
        for clique in cliques:
            if all(abs(i - j) + abs(arr[i] - arr[j]) <= k for j in clique):
                clique.append(i)
                found_clique = True
                break
        if not found_clique:
            cliques.append([i])
    
    # Prepare output
    q = len(cliques)
    c = [0] * n
    for i, clique in enumerate(cliques):
        for j in clique:
            c[j] = i + 1
    
    return arr, q, c

# Main function to handle multiple test cases
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        k = int(input[index + 1])
        index += 2
        arr, q, c = solve(n, k)
        results.append(f"{' '.join(map(str, arr))}")
        results.append(f"{q}")
        results.append(f"{' '.join(map(str, c))}")
    print("\n".join(results))

# Uncomment the following line to run the main function
# main()
```

This corrected version handles multiple test cases, assigns values to vertices, partitions them into cliques based on the condition, and returns the results in the required format.
