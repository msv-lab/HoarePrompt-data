The code snippet calculates the value of `not_mid` based on the existing values of `right`, `left`, and `mid`. Given that `mid` is calculated as `(right - left) // 2`, the expression `right - left + 1 - mid` simplifies to `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`.

Since `mid` is the integer division of `(right - left)` by 2, `not_mid` will be the remaining part of the range not covered by `mid`. This can be explicitly calculated as `right - left + 1 - mid`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `not_mid`. The values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, and `big_element` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr), `clique` is an integer representing the current clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, and `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`.**
