### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given code and its behavior in the context of the problem statement.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The main loop iterates over the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` and then calls `func_1(n, k)`.

2. **Function `func_1(n, k)`:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `cliques` is calculated as the ceiling of `n / k`.
     - Two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, are initialized to store vertex values and clique assignments respectively.
   - **Loop to Populate Arrays:**
     - For each clique index `i` from `0` to `cliques - 1`, `make_array` is called with the range `(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1))` and the clique number `i + 1`.
   - **Printing:**
     - The function prints the values in `arr`, the number of cliques, and the values in `cliquess`.

3. **Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `small_element` and `big_element` are set to `left + 1` and `right + 1` respectively.
     - `mid` is calculated as the middle of the range.
     - `not_mid` is the remaining part of the range.
   - **Filling Arrays:**
     - The first half of the range is filled with increasing values starting from `small_element`.
     - The second half of the range is filled with decreasing values starting from `big_element`.
     - The `cliquess` array is updated to reflect the clique number for the current range.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Array `arr` and `cliquess` Initialization:**
   - Both `arr` and `cliquess` are defined within `func_1` and are not global, meaning they are re-initialized for each test case.
   - However, `make_array` modifies these arrays without re-declaring them, so the changes persist within the scope of `func_1`.

2. **Clique Calculation:**
   - The number of cliques is calculated as the ceiling of `n / k`. This is a reasonable approach to ensure that all vertices are assigned to some clique.

3. **Array Filling Logic:**
   - The logic to fill `arr` and `cliquess` seems correct in terms of assigning values and clique numbers.
   - However, the filling logic might not ensure that the graph is partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

4. **Edge Condition Handling:**
   - The problem requires that an edge exists between vertices `i` and `j` if `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.
   - The current filling logic does not guarantee that this condition is met for all pairs within the same clique.

### Conclusion:
While the provided code generates a valid assignment of integers and clique numbers, it does not guarantee that the resulting graph is partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. The filling logic in `make_array` does not ensure that all pairs within the same clique satisfy the edge condition.

Therefore, the program is **incorrect** based on the problem requirements.

**Correctness: False**
