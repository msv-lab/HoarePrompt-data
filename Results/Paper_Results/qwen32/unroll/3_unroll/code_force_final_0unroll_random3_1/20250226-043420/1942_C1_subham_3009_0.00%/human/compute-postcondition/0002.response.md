The `while` loop in the provided code is `while t > 0:`. This means that the loop will execute as long as the variable `t` is greater than 0.

Given the state right before the `while` loop:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9.
- `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 · 10^5).
- `y` is 0.
- The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
- The program is currently executing the block of code under the `if` condition `if (__name__ == '__main__')`.

The only variable in the loop head is `t`. According to the condition `t > 0`, the loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is defined as an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, it is already ensured that `t` will be greater than 0.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time. The state right before the loop is already sufficient for the loop to run.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is 0. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The program is currently executing the block of code under the `if` condition `if (__name__ == '__main__')`.**
