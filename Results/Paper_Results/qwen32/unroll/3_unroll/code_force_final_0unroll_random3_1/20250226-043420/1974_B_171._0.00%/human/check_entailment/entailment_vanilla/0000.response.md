Let's analyze the given program and determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
Polycarp encodes a string `s` by:
1. Creating a sorted string `r` of all distinct characters in `s`.
2. Replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

Decoding involves reversing this process:
1. Given the encoded string `b`, we need to determine the original string `s`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program defines a function `func_1` that attempts to decode the string `b`:
1. It initializes an empty dictionary `mapping` to store the mapping from characters in `r` to characters in `b`.
2. It iterates over each character in `b`.
3. If the character is already in `mapping`, it appends the corresponding original character to `decoded`.
4. If the character is not in `mapping`, it finds the next unused character in the alphabet and maps it to the current character in `b`.
5. It appends the found character to `decoded`.
6. Finally, it joins the list `decoded` into a string and returns it.

### Issues in the Program:
The main issue with the program is that it does not correctly determine the symmetric character from `r` for each character in `b`. Instead, it attempts to map characters from `b` to the next unused character in the alphabet, which is incorrect.

The correct approach should be:
1. Determine the set of distinct characters in `b`.
2. Sort these characters to form `r`.
3. Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.
4. Use this mapping to decode the string `b`.

### Correct Approach:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
from typing import List

input = sys.stdin.readline
if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_cases = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(input().strip())
        encoded = input().strip()
        decoded = func_1(encoded)
        print(decoded)

def func_1(encoded: str) -> str:
    # Step 1: Determine the set of distinct characters in `encoded`
    distinct_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    
    # Step 2: Create a mapping from each character in `distinct_chars` to its symmetric counterpart
    mapping = {}
    n = len(distinct_chars)
    for i in range(n):
        mapping[distinct_chars[i]] = distinct_chars[n - i - 1]
    
    # Step 3: Decode the string `encoded` using the mapping
    decoded = []
    for char in encoded:
        decoded.append(mapping[char])
    
    return ''.join(decoded)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly decode the string `b` because it does not create the correct mapping from characters in `b` to their symmetric counterparts in `r`. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
