Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string as per the problem description. The problem requires reversing the encoding process, which involves creating a mapping from the distinct, ordered characters of the original string to the encoded string and then using this mapping to decode the encoded string back to the original.

However, the given `func_1` function does not do this. Instead, it tries to map each character in the encoded string to the next available character from 'a' to 'z' that hasn't been used yet, which does not correspond to the symmetry mapping described in the problem.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the correct approach should be:

1. Identify the set of distinct characters in the encoded string and sort them alphabetically to form the string `r`.
2. Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character maps to the last, the second to the second last, and so on).
3. Use this mapping to decode the encoded string back to the original string.

The provided function does not perform these steps and instead maps each new character in the encoded string to the next available character, which is not the intended decoding process.

Correctness: **False**
