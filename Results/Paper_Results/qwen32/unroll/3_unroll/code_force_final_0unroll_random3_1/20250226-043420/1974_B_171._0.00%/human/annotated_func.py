#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the input is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the encoded string b, followed by the string b of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1(encoded):
    mapping = {}
    decoded = []
    for char in encoded:
        if char in mapping:
            decoded.append(mapping[char])
        else:
            for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
                if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
                    mapping[chr(c)] = char
                    break
            decoded.append(chr(c))
        
    #State: mapping: {unique characters from encoded: corresponding unique letters}, decoded: [sequence of unique letters corresponding to encoded]
    return ''.join(decoded)
    #The program returns a string formed by joining the sequence of unique letters in the list 'decoded'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It processes this string to produce and return a new string where each unique character in the `encoded` string is replaced by a unique letter from 'a' to 'z', maintaining the order of their first appearance in the `encoded` string.
