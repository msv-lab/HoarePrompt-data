To determine the output state after the loop completes its execution, let's break down the operations performed by the loop.

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mapping` starts as an empty dictionary.
   - `decoded` starts as an empty list.
   - `encoded` is the input string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

2. **Loop Operation**:
   - For each character `char` in the `encoded` string:
     - If `char` is already a key in the `mapping` dictionary, append the corresponding value (a unique lowercase letter) to the `decoded` list.
     - If `char` is not in the `mapping` dictionary, find the first lowercase letter `c` (from 'a' to 'z') that is not yet a value in the `mapping` dictionary. Assign `char` to this letter in the `mapping` dictionary and append this letter to the `decoded` list.

3. **Effect**:
   - The `mapping` dictionary will map each unique character in the `encoded` string to a unique lowercase letter in the range 'a' to 'z'.
   - The `decoded` list will contain the sequence of these unique letters corresponding to the characters in the `encoded` string.

### Output State:

- `mapping`: This dictionary will have keys as the unique characters from the `encoded` string and values as the unique letters from 'a' to 'z'.
- `decoded`: This list will contain the sequence of letters corresponding to the characters in the `encoded` string based on the `mapping`.

### Format of the Output State:

The output state must be described in the format:
Output State: **the output state you calculate.**

### Human-readable Output State:

After the loop executes, the `decoded` list will contain a sequence of unique letters corresponding to the characters in the `encoded` string, and the `mapping` dictionary will map each unique character in the `encoded` string to a unique letter.

### Final Output State:

Output State: **mapping: {unique_char1: 'a', unique_char2: 'b', ...}, decoded: ['a', 'b', ..., 'z']** (where 'a', 'b', ..., 'z' are the letters corresponding to the unique characters in the encoded string in the order they appear).

Since the exact mapping and decoded list depend on the specific input string, we describe it in a general form:

Output State: **mapping: {unique characters from encoded: corresponding unique letters}, decoded: [sequence of unique letters corresponding to encoded]**
