### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the main issue in the provided program. The program `func_1` does not correctly decode the string `b` by not establishing the correct symmetric mapping from characters in `b` to their counterparts in `r`. Instead, it maps each character in `b` to the next unused character in the alphabet, which is incorrect according to the problem description.

Let's break down the steps that should be taken to correctly decode the string `b`:

1. **Determine the set of distinct characters in `b`**: This set of characters forms the string `r` after sorting.
2. **Sort the set of distinct characters**: This gives us the string `r` in alphabetical order.
3. **Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart**: This involves mapping the first character of `r` to the last, the second character to the second last, and so on.
4. **Decode the string `b` using the mapping**: Replace each character in `b` with its corresponding character from the mapping.

The corrected version of the program provided in the original assessment correctly implements these steps and should produce the correct decoded string `s`.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the incorrect behavior of the program and providing a corrected version. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
