The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It processes this string to produce and return a new string where each unique character in the `encoded` string is replaced by a unique letter from 'a' to 'z', maintaining the order of their first appearance in the `encoded` string.
