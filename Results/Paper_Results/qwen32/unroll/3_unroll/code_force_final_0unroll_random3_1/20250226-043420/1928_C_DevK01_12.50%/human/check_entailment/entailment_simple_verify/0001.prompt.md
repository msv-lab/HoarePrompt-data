You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python code and see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves determining the number of possible values of `k` such that, given a position `n` and a number `x` that Vasya received, the conditions of the "first-k-th" position settling are satisfied. The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions and the numbers assigned in the pattern are `1, 2, ..., k, k-1, ..., 2`.

### Key Points
1. **Pattern Repetition**: The pattern of numbers repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
2. **Constraints**: `1 <= x < n <= 10^9`.
3. **Output**: The number of different `k` that fit the given constraints.

### Code Analysis

Let's break down the provided code and see if it correctly implements the solution:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, `n` and `x` are read.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`.
   - If `y` is odd, the output is `0` because it's impossible to fit the pattern with odd `y`.

3. **Finding Possible `k` Values**:
   - The function `func_1` is called twice:
     - Once with `((y - 2) // 2, x)`.
     - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it is called again with `((n - x) // 2, x)`.
   - The function `func_1` finds divisors of a given number `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

4. **Combining Results**:
   - The results from the two calls to `func_1` are combined and duplicates are removed using `set`.
   - The length of the resulting set is printed as the answer.

### Function `func_1` Analysis
- This function calculates divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
- It checks if the square root of `q` is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
- It also checks all integers from `1` to `floor(sqrt(q))` to see if they are divisors and if their corresponding quotients are also divisors.

### Correctness Analysis

The logic of the code seems to be based on the idea that `k` must be such that `x` appears at position `n` in the repeating pattern of length `2k - 2`. The function `func_1` is supposed to find possible values of `k` by checking divisors of certain expressions derived from `n` and `x`.

However, the approach taken in the code is not entirely clear and does not directly map to the problem's requirements. Specifically, the way `k` is derived from `n` and `x` using `y = n + x` and the subsequent divisor checks does not seem to directly correspond to the pattern described in the problem.

### Conclusion

Given the complexity and the specific requirements of the problem, the provided code does not seem to correctly implement the solution for all possible cases. The approach taken in the code does not directly map to the problem's requirements and might not handle all edge cases correctly.

Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
