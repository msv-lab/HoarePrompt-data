Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of valid `k` values for each test case. Here are a few issues and edge cases that the program does not handle correctly:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `y`**:
   - The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`, but this does not align with the problem description. The settling pattern cycles every `2k - 2` positions, so `y` should be related to this cycle length.

2. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to find divisors of a number that meet certain criteria, but the criteria are not clearly defined in the context of the problem. The function does not correctly map to the problem's requirements for finding valid `k` values.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where `x` is at the boundary of the cycle (e.g., `x = 1` or `x = k`). The logic for counting valid `k` values is not robust enough to cover all possible scenarios.

4. **Missing Logic for Different Cycles**:
   - The program does not correctly account for the different cycles of the settling pattern. For example, when `n` is large, the program should consider multiple cycles and how `x` fits within those cycles.

### Example of Incorrect Output:
Let's consider the test case `n = 10`, `x = 2`:
- The correct output should be `4` (as per the problem statement), but the provided program may not handle this correctly due to the issues mentioned above.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, the program should:
1. Determine the cycle length `2k - 2`.
2. Check how `x` fits within the cycle for different values of `k`.
3. Ensure that the logic accounts for all possible cycles and positions of `x` within those cycles.

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect.
