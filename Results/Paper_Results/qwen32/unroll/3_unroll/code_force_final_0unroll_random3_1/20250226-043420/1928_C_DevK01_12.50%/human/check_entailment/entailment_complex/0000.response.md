### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the program to understand if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Understanding the Sequence:**
   - The sequence is periodic with a period of \(2k - 2\).
   - For a given \(k\), the sequence starts with \(1, 2, \ldots, k\) and then goes in reverse \(k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2\).
   - The sequence repeats this pattern.

2. **Identifying Suitable \(k\):**
   - We need to find all \(k\) such that the number Vasya received (let's call it \(x\)) is at position \(n\) in the sequence.
   - This means we need to find \(k\) such that \(x\) appears at position \(n\) in the repeating sequence described above.

3. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - The position \(n\) within the repeating block of length \(2k - 2\) can be determined by \(n \mod (2k - 2)\).
   - For \(x\) to appear at position \(n\), \(x\) must match the value at that position in the sequence.
   - There are two cases to consider:
     - The increasing part: \(1, 2, \ldots, k\).
     - The decreasing part: \(k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2\).

4. **Finding \(k\):**
   - For the increasing part, \(x\) should be at position \(x\) (since it's \(1, 2, \ldots, k\)).
   - For the decreasing part, \(x\) should be at position \(2k - x\) (since it's \(k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2\)).
   - We need to find all \(k\) such that these positions align with \(n \mod (2k - 2)\).

#### Program Analysis:
- **Input Handling:**
  - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
  - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(x\).

- **Key Calculation:**
  - The program calculates \(y = n + x\) and checks if \(y\) is even.
  - If \(y\) is odd, it prints 0 because \(k\) cannot satisfy the conditions.
  - If \(y\) is even, it calculates \((y - 2) // 2\) and \((n - x) // 2\) and finds divisors greater than or equal to \(x - 1\) using the `func_1` function.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - This function finds divisors of a given number that are greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).
  - It checks the integer square root and all divisors up to the square root.

#### Correctness:
- The program correctly identifies the conditions under which \(k\) is suitable.
- It calculates the necessary values and uses the `func_1` function to find valid divisors.
- The logic for checking the increasing and decreasing parts of the sequence is implicitly handled by the divisor calculations.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by identifying all suitable \(k\) values based on the given constraints and conditions.

**Correctness: True**
