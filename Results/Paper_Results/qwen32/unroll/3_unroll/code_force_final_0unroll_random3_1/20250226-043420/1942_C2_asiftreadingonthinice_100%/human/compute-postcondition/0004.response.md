Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a set of chosen vertices on a line of `n` vertices. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value that represents the maximum number of additional vertices Bessie can choose, given the constraints of `x` (the number of initially chosen vertices), `y` (an additional parameter affecting the calculation), and the specific positions of the initially chosen vertices. The final output for each test case is the minimum of the calculated value and `n - 2`.**
