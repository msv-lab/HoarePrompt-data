To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and understand the variables involved.

1. **Variables and Their Descriptions:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive). It seems to represent the number of test cases, but it is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
   - `n`: An integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive). It represents the number of sticks.
   - `a`: A list of `n` integers, each representing the length of a stick.
   - `ans`: The sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique stick length by 4.
   - `cnt`: A dictionary where each key is a unique length from the list `a`, and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that length appears in `a`.

2. **Calculation of `ans`:**
   - For each unique stick length in the list `a`, the code counts the occurrences (using the dictionary `cnt`).
   - For each unique length, the code calculates the integer division of the count by 4.
   - The variable `ans` is the sum of all these integer divisions.

3. **Output Description:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will output the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique stick length by 4.

Given the provided information, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans` without the specific values of `a`. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the described structure.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique stick length in the list `a` by 4)**
