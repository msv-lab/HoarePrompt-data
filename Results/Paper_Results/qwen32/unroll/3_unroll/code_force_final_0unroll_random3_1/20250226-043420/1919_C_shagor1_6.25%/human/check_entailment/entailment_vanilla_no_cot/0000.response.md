Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum penalty as described in the problem statement. The program attempts to split the array into two subsequences in such a way to minimize the total penalty, but the logic used to achieve this is flawed.

Here are some issues with the program:
1. The logic `x == y` is incorrect. It should be an assignment, not a comparison, but even then, it doesn't correctly handle the state transitions.
2. The program doesn't actually split the array into two subsequences; instead, it attempts to track the potential splits using two variables `x` and `y`, but it doesn't correctly handle the transitions between them.
3. The penalty calculation is not correctly implemented. The program increments `ans` whenever it encounters a new element that is greater than both `x` and `y`, but this doesn't guarantee that the penalty is minimized.

To correctly solve the problem, one should consider a different approach, such as using dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to find the optimal split that minimizes the total penalty.
