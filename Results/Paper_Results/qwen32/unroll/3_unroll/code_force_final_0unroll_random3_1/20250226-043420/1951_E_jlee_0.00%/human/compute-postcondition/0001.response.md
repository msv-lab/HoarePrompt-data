The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `t` must ensure that the loop can run at least once.

Since `t` is already described as an input integer representing the number of test cases, and it is given that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, the loop will definitely execute at least once as long as `t` is within the specified range. Therefore, no adjustment to `t` is necessary in terms of ensuring the loop executes. However, we should ensure that `i` is initialized correctly before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `i` is 0**
