Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array as defined in the problem statement. The beauty of the array is the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n, which can be maximized by sorting the array in either ascending or descending order. The program, however, simply calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which does not guarantee the maximum beauty in all cases.

To illustrate, let's consider the test case:
```
5
100 54 80 43 90
```
The program will output `89` (which is the difference between the maximum value 100 and the minimum value 43). However, the correct maximum beauty is `57`, which can be achieved by sorting the array in descending order: [100, 90, 80, 54, 43]. The beauty is then calculated as (90-100) + (80-90) + (54-80) + (43-54) = -10 -10 -26 -11 = 10 + 10 + 26 + 11 = 57.

Thus, the program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty for all cases, and the original assessment is correct.

Final: **False**
