To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand what the code does in each iteration. The loop runs `t` times, and in each iteration, it reads an integer `l` and a list of `l` integers `nums`. It then finds the maximum (`x`) and minimum (`y`) values in the list `nums` and prints their difference (`x - y`).

Since the code executes `t` iterations, it will print the difference between the maximum and minimum values for each of the `t` lists of integers. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are not affected by the loop and remain unchanged.

Output State: **The variable `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and `a` remains unchanged. For each of the `t` iterations, the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the input list `nums` is printed.**
