### Reasoning:

The problem asks for the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements when the array is arranged in a certain order. The beauty can be maximized by arranging the array such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

The beauty of the array \( a \) can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Beauty} = (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) \]

This simplifies to:
\[ \text{Beauty} = a_n - a_1 \]

This means that the maximum beauty is achieved when the largest element is at the end of the array and the smallest element is at the beginning. Therefore, the maximum beauty is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array.

The provided program correctly identifies the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints their difference for each test case. This is the correct approach to solve the problem.
