You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        x = 0
        y = 100000000
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        print(x - y)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a list of integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. The input integers and their counts remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array. The program calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which is not the correct approach to maximize the beauty as defined in the problem statement.

The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, the array should be rearranged such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This can be achieved by sorting the array in either ascending or descending order.

For example, consider the test case:
```
3
1 2 3
```
The program will output `2` (which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values), but the correct maximum beauty is `2` (which is calculated as (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2). However, the program does not guarantee this for all cases.

Let's consider another test case:
```
5
100 54 80 43 90
```
The program will output `89` (which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values), but the correct maximum beauty is `57` (which can be achieved by sorting the array in descending order: 100, 90, 80, 54, 43, and calculating the beauty as (90-100) + (80-90) + (54-80) + (43-54) = -10 -10 -26 -11 = 57).

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the maximum beauty for all cases.
