Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, the array should be sorted in ascending or descending order. The provided program calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

The correct approach is to sort the array in ascending or descending order and then calculate the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        nums.sort()  # Sort the array in ascending order
        beauty = 0
        for i in range(1, l):
            beauty += nums[i] - nums[i - 1]
        print(beauty)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected program sorts the array and then calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements, which will give the maximum possible beauty.
