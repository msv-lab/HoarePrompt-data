Precondition: **Each test case consists of two integers n and k, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12. Additionally, there is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, representing the number of cards of type i initially available. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.**
