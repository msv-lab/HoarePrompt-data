The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two distinct non-negative integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m` and prints a specific value based on the properties of `k`. The printed value is either `k` if `k` is a power of 2, `1` if `k` is odd, or the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` if `k` is even and not a power of 2.
