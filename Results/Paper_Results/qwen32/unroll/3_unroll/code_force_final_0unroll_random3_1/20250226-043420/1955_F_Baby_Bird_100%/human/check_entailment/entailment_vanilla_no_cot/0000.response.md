Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally. Bob wins when the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence is zero.

Here's the breakdown of the logic needed to solve the problem:

1. **Understanding XOR properties**:
   - XOR of a sequence is zero if and only if each bit position in the binary representation has an even number of 1s.
   - Numbers 1 (01 in binary), 2 (10 in binary), 3 (11 in binary), and 4 (100 in binary) will affect the XOR result based on their counts.

2. **Strategy for Eve**:
   - Eve wants Bob to win as many times as possible, which means she wants the XOR to be zero as many times as possible.
   - To achieve this, Eve can remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

3. **Counting the numbers**:
   - For the XOR of the sequence to be zero, the counts of numbers that contribute to each bit position must be even.
   - Specifically:
     - The count of numbers contributing to the least significant bit (1s and 3s) must be even.
     - The count of numbers contributing to the second least significant bit (2s and 3s) must be even.
     - The count of numbers contributing to the most significant bit (4s) must be even.

4. **Maximizing Bob's wins**:
   - To maximize Bob's wins, we need to find the maximum number of times we can remove a number such that the remaining numbers' XOR is zero.
   - This can be achieved by ensuring that the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s, when reduced, maintain the evenness property for the XOR to be zero.

Now, let's analyze the provided program:

```python
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
```

The program appears to be calculating something related to the counts of numbers and their contributions to the XOR, but it does not directly follow the logic described above. Let's simplify and re-implement the correct logic:

```python
def func():
    results = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p1, p2, p3, p4 = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win
        bob_wins = (p1 % 2) + (p2 % 2) + (p3 % 2) + (p4 % 2)
        bob_wins = (4 - bob_wins) // 2
        results.append(bob_wins)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))

func()
```

This new implementation calculates the number of each type of number that contributes an odd count to the XOR and then determines how many times Eve can remove numbers to make the XOR zero.

Given the complexity and the provided examples, the original program does not seem to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem.
