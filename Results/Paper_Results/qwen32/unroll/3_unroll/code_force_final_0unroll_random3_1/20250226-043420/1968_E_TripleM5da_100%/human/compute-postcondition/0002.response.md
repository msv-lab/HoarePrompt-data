The function `func` accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50. For each of the following `t` lines, the function receives a single integer `n`, which represents both the size of the grid and the number of cells to choose, with the constraint that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3. The function processes these inputs and returns the result for each test case. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases and, for each test case, an integer `n` representing the size of the grid and the number of cells to choose, and then return the result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) representing the size of the grid and the number of cells to choose, and returns the result for each test case.**
