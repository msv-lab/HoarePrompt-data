Reasoning: The provided program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of \(n\). 

The program outputs the points (1, 1), (1, 2), and then (i, i) for each \(i\) from 3 to \(n\). This strategy ensures that the only distinct Manhattan distances generated are 0 (for the same point) and 1 (for (1, 1) and (1, 2)), and \(2(i-1)\) for points (1, 1) and (i, i). This does not maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances.

For example:
- When \(n=3\), the points are (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 3). The set of Manhattan distances is \(\{0, 1, 4\}\), which has a size of 3.
- However, a better arrangement could be (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1), which results in the set of Manhattan distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 4.

Thus, the program does not achieve the optimal solution for maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

Correctness: **False**
