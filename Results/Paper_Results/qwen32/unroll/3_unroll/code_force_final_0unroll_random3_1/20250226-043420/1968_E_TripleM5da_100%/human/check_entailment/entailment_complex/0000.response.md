Reasoning: The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by an integer \( n \). For each test case, it outputs a series of coordinate pairs:

1. It starts by printing `(1, 1)`.
2. Then it prints `(1, 2)`.
3. For each integer \( i \) from `3` to `n`, it prints `(i, i)`.

Let's analyze if this approach maximizes the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\):

- The first two points `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)` have a Manhattan distance of `1`.
- The point `(1, 1)` and `(i, i)` for \( i \geq 3 \) have a Manhattan distance of \( |1 - i| + |1 - i| = 2(i - 1) \).
- The point `(1, 2)` and `(i, i)` for \( i \geq 3 \) have a Manhattan distance of \( |1 - i| + |2 - i| = 2(i - 1) - 1 \).

Thus, the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) will include:
- `1` (from `(1, 1)` to `(1, 2)`),
- `2(i - 1)` for \( i \geq 3 \),
- `2(i - 1) - 1` for \( i \geq 3 \).

This set will include the distances `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, ..., `2(n-1) - 1`, `2(n-1)`, which are `2(n-1)` distinct distances.

Let's check the provided examples:

- For `n = 2`, the points are `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, resulting in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\) (though the program outputs `1` and `2` as distances, it is clear that `0` is not included in the output).
- For `n = 3`, the points are `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(3, 3)`, resulting in \(\mathcal{H} = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}\).
- For `n = 4`, the points are `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(3, 3)`, and `(4, 4)`, resulting in \(\mathcal{H} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\).
- For `n = 5`, the points are `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(3, 3)`, `(4, 4)`, and `(5, 5)`, resulting in \(\mathcal{H} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}\).
- For `n = 6`, the points are `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(3, 3)`, `(4, 4)`, `(5, 5)`, and `(6, 6)`, resulting in \(\mathcal{H} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}\).

The program indeed maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
