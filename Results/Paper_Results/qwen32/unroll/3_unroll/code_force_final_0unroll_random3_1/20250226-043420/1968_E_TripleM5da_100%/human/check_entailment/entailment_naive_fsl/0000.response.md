Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to choose `n` cells in an `n x n` grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of chosen cells is maximized. The Manhattan distance between two cells `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is calculated as `|x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|`.

### Provided Program Recap
```python
def func():
    for i in range(0, int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        print(1, 1)
        print(1, 2)
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            print(i, i)
```

### Analysis
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the integer `n`, and then prints the coordinates of `n` cells as follows:
- `(1, 1)`
- `(1, 2)`
- `(3, 3)`
- `(4, 4)`
- ...
- `(n, n)`

Let's verify if this arrangement maximizes the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

### Verification
1. **Base Cases**:
   - For `n = 2`, the cells are `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`. The Manhattan distances are `0` and `1`. This is correct.
   - For `n = 3`, the cells are `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(3, 3)`. The Manhattan distances are `0`, `1`, `2`, and `3`. This is correct.
   
2. **General Case**:
   - The cells `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)` will always have a distance of `1`.
   - The cells `(1, 1)` and `(i, i)` for `i > 1` will have a distance of `2(i-1)`.
   - The cells `(1, 2)` and `(i, i)` for `i > 1` will have a distance of `2(i-1) - 1`.
   - The cells `(i, i)` and `(j, j)` for `i != j` will have a distance of `2|i - j|`.
   
   This arrangement can indeed generate a variety of Manhattan distances, but we need to check if it maximizes the number of distinct distances.

### Checking the Maximum Number of Distinct Distances
The maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances that can be achieved in an `n x n` grid is `2n - 1` (distances from `0` to `2(n-1)`).

Let's see if the provided arrangement can achieve this:
- For `n = 2`, the distances are `0` and `1` (2 distinct distances).
- For `n = 3`, the distances are `0`, `1`, `2`, and `3` (4 distinct distances).
- For `n = 4`, the distances are `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6` (7 distinct distances).
- For `n = 5`, the distances are `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, and `8` (9 distinct distances).
- For `n = 6`, the distances are `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`, `10`, and `11` (12 distinct distances).

The provided arrangement does not seem to cover all possible distances, especially for larger `n`. For example, for `n = 4`, the arrangement `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(3, 3)`, and `(4, 4)` only covers distances `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6`, but it misses `7` and `8`.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not always maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances for every potential case. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
