Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of a string `s` of length between 1 and 5000, containing only lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. The total length of all strings `s` across all test cases does not exceed 5000. The function processes each string `s` and returns a result for each test case.**
