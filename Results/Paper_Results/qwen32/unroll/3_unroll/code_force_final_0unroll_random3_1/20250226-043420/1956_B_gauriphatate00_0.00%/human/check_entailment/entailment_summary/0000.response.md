Reasoning: 
The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally against Nene, who plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score. The key to the solution lies in counting the number of pairs of cards you have (cards with the same number) and understanding that the maximum points you can get is the minimum of the number of pairs you have and half the number of cards each player receives (`n // 2`). This is because each pair can contribute at most one point, and you can only play `n` turns.

Function `func_1` correctly implements this logic by using a `Counter` to count occurrences of each card number and then determining the number of pairs. It returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`, which aligns with the problem's requirements.

Function `func_2` is responsible for handling input and output. It reads multiple test cases, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results. However, the output hints provided for `func_2` incorrectly describe its behavior. The function should not compute the number of unique integers that appear exactly once in the list; instead, it should compute the number of pairs as per the logic in `func_1`.

Given the discrepancy in the description of `func_2`'s behavior, the program as a whole is not correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
