The code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `data`, `idx`, `t`). Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `results` list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of cards you and Nene each receive, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `idx` is 1, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `results` is an empty list.**
