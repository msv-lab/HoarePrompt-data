Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - The number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, a positive integer `x` (1 â‰¤ x < 2^30).

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case:
     - The length of the array `n`.
     - The array `a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}` where each `a_i` is 1, 0, or -1.
     - The array must satisfy the equation \(x = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i \cdot 2^i\).
     - No two consecutive elements in the array should be non-zero.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `s` to store the binary representation of `x`.
   - It then iterates over the first 30 bits of `x` (since `x < 2^30`), appending '1' or '0' to `s` based on whether the corresponding bit in `x` is set.

3. **Modification to Satisfy Conditions:**
   - The program then goes through the list `s` to modify it such that no two consecutive elements are non-zero.
   - It uses a flag to keep track of whether a modification has been made.
   - If two consecutive elements are '1', it changes the first to '-1' and the second to '0'.
   - If the flag is set and the current element is '0', it changes it to '1'.
   - If the flag is set and the current element is not '0', it changes it to '0'.
   - After the loop, if the flag is still set and the last element is '0', it changes the last element to '1'.
   - If the flag is still set and the last element is not '0', it changes the last element to '0' and appends '1' to `s`, increasing the length.

4. **Final Adjustment:**
   - The program then goes through the modified list `s` to ensure that no two consecutive elements are non-zero.
   - If it finds a '-1' followed by a '1', it swaps them.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the length of the modified list and the modified list itself.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Binary Conversion:**
   - The program converts `x` to a binary string and stores it in `s` as strings ('1', '0'), not integers (1, 0).

2. **Incorrect Adjustment Logic:**
   - The logic to adjust the list `s` to ensure no two consecutive elements are non-zero is flawed.
   - The flag mechanism and the adjustments made do not guarantee that the resulting list will satisfy the conditions of the problem.
   - The final adjustment loop does not correctly handle all cases.

3. **Output Issues:**
   - The program prints the list `s` before making the necessary adjustments, which is incorrect.
   - The length of the list is not correctly calculated after modifications.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the program, it is clear that the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
