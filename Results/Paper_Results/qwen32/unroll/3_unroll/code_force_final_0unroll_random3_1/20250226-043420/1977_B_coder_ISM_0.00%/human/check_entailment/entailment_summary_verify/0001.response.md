### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. **Array Constraints:**
   - \(1 \le n \le 32\)
   - Each \(a_i\) is either 1, 0, or -1.
   - The array must satisfy \(x = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i \cdot 2^i\).
   - No two consecutive elements can be non-zero.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - Input: Number of test cases \(t\) and for each test case, a positive integer \(x\).
   - Output: For each test case, the length \(n\) of the array and the array itself.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \(x\).

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `s` to store the binary representation of `x`.
   - It iterates over the first 30 bits of `x` and appends '1' or '0' to `s` based on whether the corresponding bit in `x` is set. This step is correct in terms of identifying the binary representation.

3. **Modification to Satisfy Conditions:**
   - The program then modifies the list `s` to ensure no two consecutive elements are non-zero.
   - It uses a flag to keep track of whether a modification has been made.
   - The logic for modifying the list is flawed:
     - If two consecutive elements are '1', it changes the first to '-1' and the second to '0'. This step is correct.
     - If the flag is set and the current element is '0', it changes it to '1'. This step is incorrect because it does not respect the requirement that no two consecutive elements should be non-zero.
     - If the flag is set and the current element is not '0', it changes it to '0'. This step is also incorrect for the same reason.
     - After the loop, if the flag is still set and the last element is '0', it changes the last element to '1'. This step is incorrect because it does not respect the requirement that no two consecutive elements should be non-zero.
     - If the flag is still set and the last element is not '0', it changes the last element to '0' and appends '1' to `s`, increasing the length. This step is incorrect for the same reason.
   - The final adjustment loop does not correctly handle all cases.

4. **Output Issues:**
   - The program prints the list `s` before making the necessary adjustments, which is incorrect.
   - The length of the list is not correctly calculated after modifications.

### Function Summary:
The function summary provided describes the high-level behavior of the program but does not capture the specific issues with the logic for modifying the list to ensure no two consecutive elements are non-zero.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the program, particularly the flawed logic for modifying the list to satisfy the conditions, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Final: False**
