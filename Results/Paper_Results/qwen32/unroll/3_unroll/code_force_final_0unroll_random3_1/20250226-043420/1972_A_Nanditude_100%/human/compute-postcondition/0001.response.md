The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not plan to use. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The loop will execute `t` times.

Given the provided state before the loop starts, the only thing that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is the value of `t`. Since `t` represents the number of test cases and must be at least 1 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

This ensures that the `for` loop will execute at least once, as required by the problem statement.
