Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, the first element `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) is followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile; `A` is False; `set_` is a sorted list of unique integers from `arr`. The smallest element in `set_` is not 1.**
