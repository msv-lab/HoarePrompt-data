Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The first element `t` in `arr` represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the first element `n` is followed by `n` integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The function returns 'Alice' if the number of unique stone counts minus one is even; otherwise, it returns 'Bob'.**
