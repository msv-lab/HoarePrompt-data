Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules described. The logic in `func_1` is incorrect for determining the winner. The game is essentially a variant of the Nim game where the winning strategy is based on the binary representation of the pile sizes.

The correct approach involves the use of the Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes). If the Nim-sum is zero at the start, the second player (Bob) wins if both play optimally. Otherwise, the first player (Alice) wins.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))
    nim_sum = 0
    for a in arr:
        nim_sum ^= a
    if nim_sum == 0:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')
```

This program correctly calculates the Nim-sum and determines the winner based on whether it is zero or not.
