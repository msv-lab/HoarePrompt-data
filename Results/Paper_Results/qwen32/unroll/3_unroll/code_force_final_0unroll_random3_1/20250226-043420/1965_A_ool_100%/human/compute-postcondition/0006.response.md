Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, the first element `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) is followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile; `A` is False; `set_` is a sorted list of unique integers from `arr`. The first element of `set_` is 1; `not_c` is True.**

Explanation: The code snippet `not_c = True` sets the variable `not_c` to `True`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain as described in the initial state.
