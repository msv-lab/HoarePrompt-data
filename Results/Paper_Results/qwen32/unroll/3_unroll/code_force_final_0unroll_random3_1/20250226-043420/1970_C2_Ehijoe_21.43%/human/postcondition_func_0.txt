The function `func_1` computes distances from a starting node to all other reachable nodes in a graph represented by a dictionary of nodes and their neighbors, excluding paths that revisit the parent node. It returns `[0]` if the starting node has no neighbors other than its parent, otherwise, it returns a list of distances to all reachable nodes.
