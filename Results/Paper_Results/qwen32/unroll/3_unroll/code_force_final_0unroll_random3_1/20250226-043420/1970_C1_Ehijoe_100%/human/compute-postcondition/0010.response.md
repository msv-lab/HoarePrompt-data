The code snippet `tree = [s]` initializes a new list `tree` with a single element `s`. This means that `tree` now contains one element, which is the value of `s`. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`, `nodes`, `ends`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists where each key from 1 to n (inclusive) has a list of integers representing its neighbors as defined by the input edges, `ends` is an empty list, `tree` is a list containing the single element `s`.**
