Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists.**

Explanation: The variable `nodes` is now a defaultdict of lists, meaning it will automatically create a list for any new key that is accessed. The values of `n`, `t`, `edges`, and `empty` remain unchanged.
