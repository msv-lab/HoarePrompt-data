The code snippet `v = [0] * (n + 1)` initializes a list `v` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and `p` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` != `i`; `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
