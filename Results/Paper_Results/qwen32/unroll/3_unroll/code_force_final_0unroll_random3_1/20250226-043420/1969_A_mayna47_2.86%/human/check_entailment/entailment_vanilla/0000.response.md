To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze its logic and compare it against the problem requirements.

### Problem Breakdown:
- Monocarp needs at least 2 friends at his party.
- Friend `i` will attend if both `i` and `p_i` (i.e., friend `i`'s best friend) receive invitations.
- The goal is to find the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends attend.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of best friends `p`.

2. **Handling `n == 2`:**
   - If there are only 2 friends, both must be invited since each friend's best friend is the other. This is correctly handled with `print(2)`.

3. **Checking for Triangular Relationships:**
   - The program checks if there exists a triangular relationship among friends, i.e., if `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If such a relationship exists, it means that inviting any one of these three friends will result in at least two friends attending.
   - This is a valid check because if `i` is best friends with `j`, and `j` is best friends with `k`, and `k` is best friends with `i`, inviting any one of them will ensure that at least two attend the party (the two others will also receive invitations indirectly).

4. **General Case:**
   - If no such triangular relationship is found, the program defaults to inviting 3 friends. This is because in the worst case (no triangular relationships), we need to invite at least 3 friends to ensure that at least 2 attend.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program correctly handles the special case when `n == 2` by directly printing `2`.
- The program correctly identifies triangular relationships among friends and handles them by printing `2`.
- The program defaults to printing `3` when no triangular relationships are found, which is a reasonable approach given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and general cases appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
