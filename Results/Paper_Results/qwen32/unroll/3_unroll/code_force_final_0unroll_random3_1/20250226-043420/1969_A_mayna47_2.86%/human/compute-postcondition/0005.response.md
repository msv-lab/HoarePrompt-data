Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50 and `n` is not equal to 2; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` != `i`; `v` is a list where the first element is 0 and the next `n` elements are the integers read from the input.**
