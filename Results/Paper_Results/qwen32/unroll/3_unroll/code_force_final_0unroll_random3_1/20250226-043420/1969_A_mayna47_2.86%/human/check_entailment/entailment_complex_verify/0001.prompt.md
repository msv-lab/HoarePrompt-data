You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == 2:
        print(2)
    else:
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
        print(3)



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i != i.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (n == 2) :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
    else :
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
            
        #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; n is the input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50 and n is not equal to 2; p is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i != i; v is a list where the first element is 0 and the next n elements are the integers read from the input. The loop has completed all iterations without printing 2.
        print(3)
        #This is printed: 3
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` != `i`; `v` is a list where the first element is 0 and the next `n` elements are the integers read from the input. If `n` is 2, the specific conditions for `n` being 2 are met. Otherwise, the loop has completed all iterations without printing 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers `p` where each integer `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` != `i`. It then determines and prints either `2` or `3` based on whether there exists an index `i` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If `n` is `2`, it directly prints `2`. Otherwise, it checks the condition for all `i` from `1` to `n` and prints `2` if the condition is met for any `i`; otherwise, it prints `3`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
Monocarp wants to invite friends to his party such that at least two of them attend. Each friend i has a best friend p_i, and friend i will attend the party only if both i and p_i receive invitations. The task is to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to ensure that at least two friends attend the party.

### Key Observations:
1. **For n = 2**: Since there are only two friends, Monocarp has to invite both of them to ensure at least two friends attend. So, the answer is 2.
2. **For n > 2**:
   - If there exists a triplet (i, p_i, p_{p_i}) such that p_{p_i} = i (a cycle of length 3), inviting any two friends in this triplet will ensure that at least two friends attend. Hence, the answer is 2.
   - If no such triplet exists, Monocarp needs to invite at least three friends to ensure that at least two friends attend. This is because any two friends invited might not necessarily have their best friends invited, and inviting three friends can ensure that at least two of them and their best friends are covered.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code follows the above logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of friends and their best friends.
3. If the number of friends is 2, it directly prints 2.
4. Otherwise, it checks for the existence of a triplet (i, p_i, p_{p_i}) such that p_{p_i} = i. If found, it prints 2.
5. If no such triplet is found, it prints 3.

### Correctness:
The logic implemented in the code is correct based on the problem description. It accurately checks for the conditions and provides the correct minimum number of invitations required.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct as it follows the problem's requirements and handles all edge cases appropriately.
