Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
Monocarp wants to invite friends to his party such that at least two of them attend. Each friend i has a best friend p_i, and friend i will attend the party only if both i and p_i receive invitations. The task is to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to ensure that at least two friends attend the party.

### Key Observations:
1. **For n = 2**: Since there are only two friends, Monocarp has to invite both of them to ensure at least two friends attend. So, the answer is 2.
2. **For n > 2**:
   - If there exists a triplet (i, p_i, p_{p_i}) such that p_{p_i} = i (a cycle of length 3), inviting any two friends in this triplet will ensure that at least two friends attend. Hence, the answer is 2.
   - If no such triplet exists, Monocarp needs to invite at least three friends to ensure that at least two friends attend. This is because any two friends invited might not necessarily have their best friends invited, and inviting three friends can ensure that at least two of them and their best friends are covered.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code follows the above logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of friends and their best friends.
3. If the number of friends is 2, it directly prints 2.
4. Otherwise, it checks for the existence of a triplet (i, p_i, p_{p_i}) such that p_{p_i} = i. If found, it prints 2.
5. If no such triplet is found, it prints 3.

### Correctness:
The logic implemented in the code is correct based on the problem description. It accurately checks for the conditions and provides the correct minimum number of invitations required.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct as it follows the problem's requirements and handles all edge cases appropriately.
