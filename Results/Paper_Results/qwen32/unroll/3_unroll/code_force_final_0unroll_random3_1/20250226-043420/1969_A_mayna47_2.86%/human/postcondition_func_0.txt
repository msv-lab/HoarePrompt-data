The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers `p` where each integer `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` != `i`. It then determines and prints either `2` or `3` based on whether there exists an index `i` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If `n` is `2`, it directly prints `2`. Otherwise, it checks the condition for all `i` from `1` to `n` and prints `2` if the condition is met for any `i`; otherwise, it prints `3`.
