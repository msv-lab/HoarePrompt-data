Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}), representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively. The function processes each test case and returns a result indicating whether Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels with her `n` coins.**
