### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program to determine if it correctly solves the problem based on the given conditions and example outputs.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of coins Alice has) and `k` (the number of jewels Alice should buy).
   - It initializes `rep`, `number`, and `tab` to 0, an undefined value, and an empty list respectively.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues while `n` is not zero, `k` is greater than zero, `rep` is less than 60, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates `Min` and `Max` as the minimum and maximum of `n // k` and `k`.
   - It then checks if `Max` is equal to `k` and if `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`. If true, it sets `number` to `Min` and subtracts `Max` from `k`. Otherwise, it sets `number` to `Max` and subtracts `Min` from `k`.
   - It appends `number` to the list `tab`.
   - It then subtracts `Min * Max` from `n` and increments `rep` by 1.

3. **Output**:
   - After the loop, if `k` is zero, it prints "YES", the length of `tab`, and the elements of `tab` as the prices of the stalls.
   - If `k` is not zero, it prints "NO".

### Issues in the Program:
- **Logic Flaw**: The logic inside the loop is flawed. The goal is to make Alice buy exactly `k` jewels, but the current implementation does not guarantee this.
- **Incorrect Price Calculation**: The calculation of `Min` and `Max` and their usage to determine `number` and to update `n` and `k` does not ensure that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `n` is very large and `k` is small, or vice versa.

### Example Analysis:
- For the input `7 3`, the output is "YES" with prices `2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11`, which is incorrect because Alice would buy more than 3 jewels.
- For the input `6 4`, the output is "NO", which is correct because it's impossible to make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels with 6 coins using the given logic.
- For the input `255 8`, the output is "YES" with prices `128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1`, which is correct because Alice would buy exactly 8 jewels.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all cases correctly and contains logical errors. Therefore, it is not correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
