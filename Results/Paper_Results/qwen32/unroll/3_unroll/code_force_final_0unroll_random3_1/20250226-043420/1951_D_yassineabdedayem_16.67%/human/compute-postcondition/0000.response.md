Output State: **`t` is an input integer, each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought at the end. There are multiple test cases.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the integer input, which represents the number of test cases. The conditions and values of `n` and `k` for each test case remain as described in the initial state.
