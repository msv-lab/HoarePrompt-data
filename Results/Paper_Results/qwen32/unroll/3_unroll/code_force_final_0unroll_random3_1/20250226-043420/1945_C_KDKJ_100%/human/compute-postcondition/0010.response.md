Functionality: **The function reads a positive integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's. It calculates and prints an index `i` that represents a position in the string where the counts of '0's on the left and '1's on the right are balanced in a specific way, or the closest to being balanced.**
