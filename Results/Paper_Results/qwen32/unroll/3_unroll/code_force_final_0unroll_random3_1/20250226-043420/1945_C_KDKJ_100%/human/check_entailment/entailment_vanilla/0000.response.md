### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Preprocessing:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of houses `n` and the string `a` of length `n` representing the preferences of the residents.

2. **Cumulative Count Calculation:**
   - It initializes a list `S` with a single element `[0, 0]` to keep track of cumulative counts of `0`s and `1`s up to each house.
   - It iterates through the string `a` and updates the cumulative counts. If the character is `'0'`, it increments the count of `0`s; otherwise, it increments the count of `1`s.

3. **Finding the Optimal Position:**
   - It initializes `ans` to `-1` to store the optimal position.
   - It iterates through all possible positions `i` where the road can be built (from `0` to `n`).
   - For each position `i`, it calculates:
     - `left`: the number of `0`s to the left of the road (inclusive of the `i`-th house).
     - `lsum`: the total number of houses to the left of the road.
     - `right`: the number of `1`s to the right of the road (exclusive of the `i`-th house).
     - `rsum`: the total number of houses to the right of the road.
   - It checks if the number of `0`s to the left is at least half of `lsum` and the number of `1`s to the right is at least half of `rsum`.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it checks if this position `i` is closer to the middle of the village compared to the current `ans`. If it is, it updates `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the optimal position `ans` for each test case.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:
- **Cumulative Count:** The program correctly maintains cumulative counts of `0`s and `1`s, which is essential for efficiently checking the conditions for each possible position.
- **Condition Checking:** It correctly checks if the number of residents on each side of the road who want to live on that side is at least half of the total residents on that side.
- **Optimal Position Selection:** It selects the position that is closest to the middle of the village and satisfies the conditions. If there are multiple such positions, it selects the smaller one.
- **Edge Cases:** The program handles cases where the road can be built before the first house (`i = 0`) and after the last house (`i = n`).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It efficiently calculates the required conditions and selects the optimal position for the road.
