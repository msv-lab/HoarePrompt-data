You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` takes no arguments. The input is provided via standard input and consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ m ≤ 5) representing the number of problems in the bank and the number of upcoming rounds, respectively. This is followed by a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G' representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank. The number of test cases, t, is given at the beginning and satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
def func_1():
    return 0
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`, and a string `a` representing the difficulties of problems in a bank. The function processes these test cases but always returns 0.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns 0


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
