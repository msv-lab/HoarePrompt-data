#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` takes no arguments. The input is provided via standard input and consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ m ≤ 5) representing the number of problems in the bank and the number of upcoming rounds, respectively. This is followed by a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G' representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank. The number of test cases, t, is given at the beginning and satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
def func_1():
    return 0
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and always returns 0, regardless of the input provided via standard input.
