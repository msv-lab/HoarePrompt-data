Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. The function `func_1` does not properly compute the profit for a given `k`, and the binary search logic is not correctly implemented for this problem.

The function `func_1(k, a, b, n)` calculates the total revenue for a given `k` but does not compare it against the revenue for other values of `k`. Instead, it checks if the total revenue is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`, which is not the correct condition to determine the maximum profit.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to compute the profit for each possible value of `k` (from 0 to n) and choose the value of `k` that maximizes the profit. Here's the corrected approach:

1. For each `k` from 0 to n, calculate the total revenue:
   - Revenue from selling the first `k` buns at modified prices: `sum(b - i for i in range(k))`
   - Revenue from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price: `(n - k) * a`
   - Total revenue for this `k`: `sum(b - i for i in range(k)) + (n - k) * a`

2. Track the maximum revenue obtained from all possible values of `k`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(n + 1):
            profit = sum(b - i for i in range(k)) + (n - k) * a
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        print(max_profit)
```

This code correctly calculates the maximum profit by evaluating all possible values of `k` and selecting the one that yields the highest profit. The original provided code does not do this and hence is incorrect.
