Output State: **The program returns True**

Explanation: Given the initial state and the calculation of `ans` as `k * b + (n - k) * a`, we need to evaluate the expression `ans <= n * max(a, b)`. Since `ans` is a linear combination of `a` and `b` weighted by `k` and `n-k` respectively, and `max(a, b)` is the larger of `a` and `b`, the expression `n * max(a, b)` represents the maximum possible value of `ans` if all elements were the larger of `a` or `b`. Therefore, `ans` will always be less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`, resulting in the program returning `True`.
