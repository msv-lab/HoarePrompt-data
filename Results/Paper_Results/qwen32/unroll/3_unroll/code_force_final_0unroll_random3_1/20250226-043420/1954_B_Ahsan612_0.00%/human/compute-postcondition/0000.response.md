In the given task, the loop head only contains the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop iterates over the range of the integer input, which is the number of test cases, `t`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that the input integer `t` is at least 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable that does not need to be adjusted in the state.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
