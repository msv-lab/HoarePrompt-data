### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, and if those two smaller rectangles can form a new rectangle different from the original one. Two rectangles are considered the same if they are rotations of each other.

The key insight is that a rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles and reassembled into a different rectangle if at least one of its sides is even. This is because:
- If \(a\) is even, we can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of size \(a/2 \times b\), and these can be reassembled into a new rectangle of size \(a \times b/2\).
- If \(b\) is even, we can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of size \(a \times b/2\), and these can be reassembled into a new rectangle of size \(a/2 \times b\).

If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles that can form a different rectangle because the resulting smaller rectangles will also have odd dimensions, and they cannot form a rectangle with different dimensions by rearrangement.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking if at least one of the dimensions is even and printing "Yes" if true, otherwise "No". This matches the problem's requirements.
