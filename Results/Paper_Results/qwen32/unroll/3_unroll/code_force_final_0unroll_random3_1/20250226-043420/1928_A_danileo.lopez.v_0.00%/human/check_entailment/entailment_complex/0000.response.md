### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining if Bob can form a different rectangle by cutting an original rectangle of size `a x b` into two smaller rectangles and then rearranging them. The key insight is that if either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can always form a different rectangle. This is because:

- If `a` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of size `a/2 x b`, and these two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle of size `a x (b/2)` (or `b x a/2` if rotated).
- If `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of size `a x b/2`, and these two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle of size `(b/2) x a` (or `a x b/2` if rotated).

Thus, the condition `a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0` correctly identifies whether a different rectangle can be formed.

The provided code correctly implements this logic by iterating through each test case, reading the dimensions `a` and `b`, and checking if either dimension is even. If so, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
