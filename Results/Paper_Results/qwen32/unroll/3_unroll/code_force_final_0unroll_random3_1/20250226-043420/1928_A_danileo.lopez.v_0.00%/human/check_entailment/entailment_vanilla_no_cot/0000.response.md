To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the problem and the logic implemented in the program.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob has a rectangle of size \( a \times b \). He wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles with integer sides and then form another rectangle from these two smaller rectangles. The key points are:
1. The cut must be parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle.
2. The rectangles formed must be able to be rearranged to form a new rectangle different from the original one.
3. Rectangles differing only by a 90Â° rotation are considered the same.

### Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:
- If either \( a \) or \( b \) is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle. This is because:
  - If \( a \) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two rectangles of size \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \). These can be rearranged to form a new rectangle of size \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \) if \( b \) is also even, or \( \frac{a}{2} \times 2b \) if \( b \) is odd.
  - If \( b \) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two rectangles of size \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \). These can be rearranged to form a new rectangle of size \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) if \( a \) is also even, or \( 2a \times \frac{b}{2} \) if \( a \) is odd.
- If both \( a \) and \( b \) are odd, Bob cannot cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle different from the original one. This is because cutting an odd-sized rectangle into two smaller rectangles results in rectangles with at least one dimension being 1, and these cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle different from the original one.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program checks if either \( a \) or \( b \) is even. If either is even, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No". This logic aligns with our analysis above.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can form a new rectangle from the given rectangle.
