The value of `testcases` is reassigned to the result of the function call `func_3()`. The previous value of `testcases` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, but this value is overwritten. The new value of `testcases` will be whatever value `func_3()` returns. The output state will reflect this change, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()`**.
