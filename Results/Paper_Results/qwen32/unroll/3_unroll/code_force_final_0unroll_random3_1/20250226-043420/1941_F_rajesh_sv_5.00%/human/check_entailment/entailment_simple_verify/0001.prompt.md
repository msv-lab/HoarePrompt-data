You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Program Structure Overview:
1. **Helper Functions**:
   - `func_1(func)`, `wrapper(*args)`: These functions seem intended to implement memoization, but they are not correctly defined and not used in the program.
   - `func_2()`: Reads a line from standard input and strips whitespace.
   - `func_3()`: Reads an integer from standard input.
   - `func_4(delimiter=' ')`: Reads a line of space-separated integers and returns them as a list.
   - `func_5()`: Reads a line from standard input without stripping.

2. **Main Function (`func_6`)**:
   - Reads the number of problems `n`, number of models `m`, and number of functions `k`.
   - Reads the list of problem complexities `A`.
   - Reads the list of model complexities `D` and sorts it, removing duplicates with `set`.
   - Reads the list of function complexities `F`.
   - Finds the maximum and second maximum differences between consecutive problem complexities in `A`.
   - Iterates over each function complexity `f` in `F` to find the optimal model complexity `d` in `D` to minimize the imbalance.
   - Uses binary search to find the best position to insert the new problem complexity `d + f` to minimize the imbalance.
   - Prints the minimum imbalance.

3. **Execution Function (`func_7`)**:
   - Reads the number of test cases.
   - Calls `func_6` for each test case.

#### Analysis:
- **Memoization Functions**: `func_1` and `wrapper` are not correctly defined and not used in the program. They can be safely ignored or removed.
- **Input Reading**: The functions for reading input (`func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) are correctly implemented and used.
- **Finding Maximum Differences**: The program correctly identifies the largest and second largest differences in the list `A`.
- **Binary Search for Optimal Insertion**: The binary search logic is used to find the optimal position to insert the new problem complexity `d + f` to minimize the imbalance. This logic appears correct.
- **Output**: The program prints the minimum imbalance for each test case.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum imbalance by adding at most one problem to the set. The input reading and output handling are correct, and the core logic for minimizing imbalance is implemented correctly.
