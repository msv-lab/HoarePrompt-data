### Reasoning:

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`. It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Path Calculation**: For both players, the program calculates the path they would follow according to the rules of the game:
   - It initializes a list `pathb` for Bodya and `paths` for Sasha.
   - It uses a `vis` (visited) list to keep track of the positions already visited to detect cycles.
   - It iteratively follows the permutation `p` starting from `P_B` for Bodya and `P_S` for Sasha, appending the corresponding values from `a` to `pathb` and `paths` respectively, until a cycle is detected.

3. **Score Calculation**: For each path, the program calculates the maximum possible score within `k` turns:
   - It initializes `resb` and `ress` to store the maximum scores for Bodya and Sasha.
   - It uses a prefix sum approach to calculate the score for each possible number of turns up to `k` and updates the maximum score accordingly.

4. **Result Determination**: After calculating the maximum possible scores for both players, the program compares them:
   - If Bodya's score is higher, it prints "Bodya".
   - If Sasha's score is higher, it prints "Sasha".
   - If the scores are equal, it prints "Draw".

### Verification:
The program correctly handles all the given constraints and examples. It efficiently computes the maximum scores for both players by leveraging the properties of the permutation and the array `a` within the given number of turns `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" based on the given rules and constraints.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
