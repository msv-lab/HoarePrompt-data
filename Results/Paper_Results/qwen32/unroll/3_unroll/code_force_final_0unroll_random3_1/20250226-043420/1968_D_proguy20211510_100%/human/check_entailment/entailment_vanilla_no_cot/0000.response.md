Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed to correctly solve the problem:

1. **Cycle Detection and Scoring Calculation**: The program correctly identifies cycles for both players, but the scoring calculation for the players is incorrect. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that after entering a cycle, the player will continue to gain points based on the values in the cycle. The current implementation does not handle this correctly.

2. **Cycle Handling**: The program does not handle the scenario where the player stays in the cycle for the remaining turns after entering it. It should calculate the sum of the cycle and determine how many full cycles fit into the remaining turns, as well as any additional points from partial cycles.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where `k` is very large and the player enters a cycle quickly. In such cases, the player's score should be calculated based on the cycle's sum and the number of full cycles that can be completed within `k` turns.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Detect cycles and calculate their sums.
- Determine how many full cycles can be completed within `k` turns and add the corresponding points.
- Add points for any partial cycles that fit into the remaining turns after completing full cycles.
- Compare the final scores of Bodya and Sasha and determine the winner.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k, pb, ps = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        def calculate_score(start):
            path = []
            vis = [0] * n
            pos = start - 1
            while not vis[pos]:
                vis[pos] = 1
                path.append(a[pos])
                pos = p[pos] - 1
            
            cycle_start = path.index(a[pos])
            cycle = path[cycle_start:]
            non_cycle = path[:cycle_start]
            
            non_cycle_sum = sum(non_cycle)
            cycle_sum = sum(cycle)
            cycle_len = len(cycle)
            
            if k < len(non_cycle):
                return sum(path[:k])
            else:
                full_cycles = (k - len(non_cycle)) // cycle_len
                remaining_turns = (k - len(non_cycle)) % cycle_len
                return non_cycle_sum + full_cycles * cycle_sum + sum(cycle[:remaining_turns])
        
        resb = calculate_score(pb)
        ress = calculate_score(ps)
        
        if resb > ress:
            print('Bodya')
        elif ress > resb:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

This corrected version properly handles the cycle detection and scoring calculation, ensuring that the program correctly determines the winner based on the rules provided.
