#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n, k, P_B, and P_S are integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. p is a list of n integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n. a is a list of n integers where each a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it evaluates two paths starting from positions `P_B` and `P_S` respectively, following the sequence defined by list `p`, and accumulates values from list `a`. It calculates the maximum possible accumulated value for each path within `k` steps and determines the winner ("Bodya" or "Sasha") based on these values. If the accumulated values are equal, it results in a "Draw". The function outputs the result for each test case.
