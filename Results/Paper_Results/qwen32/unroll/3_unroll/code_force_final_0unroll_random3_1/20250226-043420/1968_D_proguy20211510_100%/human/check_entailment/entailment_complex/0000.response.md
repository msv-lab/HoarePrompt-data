### Reasoning:

The program appears to correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
  
2. **Path Calculation**: For each player (Bodya and Sasha), the program calculates the path they will follow in the game. This is done by repeatedly following the permutation `p` starting from their respective starting positions `P_B` and `P_S` until a cycle is detected (i.e., a position is visited more than once).

3. **Score Calculation**: For each path, the program calculates the maximum possible score that a player can achieve within `k` turns. This is done by considering all possible ways to stay or move at each step and choosing the strategy that maximizes the score.

4. **Comparison**: After calculating the maximum possible scores for both players, the program compares them and prints the winner ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").

### Correctness:

- **Path Detection**: The program correctly detects cycles in the permutation, which is crucial for determining the path each player follows.
- **Score Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the maximum possible score based on the given rules and constraints.
- **Comparison**: The comparison of scores and the determination of the winner is accurate.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
