### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` (the length of the permutation, the number of turns, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha).
   - It reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The program detects the cycles in the permutation for both Bodya and Sasha starting from their respective positions.
   - For Bodya, it iterates through the permutation starting from `pb` and records the scores in `pathb` until it encounters a repeated position.
   - The same process is repeated for Sasha starting from `ps`, and the scores are recorded in `paths`.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - For each player, the program calculates the maximum possible score after `k` turns.
   - It iterates through the recorded scores in `pathb` and `paths`, and for each turn, it calculates the score by summing the scores from the start up to that point and considering the remaining turns.
   - It keeps track of the maximum score found for both players.

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - The program compares the maximum scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, or "Draw" if their scores are equal.

### Correctness:

The program correctly handles the cycle detection and score calculation as per the problem description. It ensures that the maximum score is calculated for both players and compares them accurately. The logic for handling the number of turns (`k`) and the cycles within the permutation is correctly implemented. Therefore, the program should produce the correct output for the given problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
