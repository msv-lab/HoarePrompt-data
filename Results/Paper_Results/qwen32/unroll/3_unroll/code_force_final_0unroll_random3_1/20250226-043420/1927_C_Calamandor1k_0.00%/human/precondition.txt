t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, and k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 · min(n, m). The arrays a and b contain n and m integers respectively, with each integer in the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6. The sum of n and m across all test cases does not exceed 4 · 10^5.
