The only variable in the loop head of the provided for loop is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't intend to use. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is the number of iterations specified.

To ensure that the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The other variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` do not directly affect whether the loop will execute or not; they are used within the loop body, which is omitted in this case.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure the loop can execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `m` are integers representing the lengths of arrays `a` and `b` respectively, where 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2·10^5, `k` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 2·min(`n`, `m`), arrays `a` and `b` consist of integers where 1 ≤ `a_i`, `b_j` ≤ 10^6 for all valid indices `i` and `j`.**
