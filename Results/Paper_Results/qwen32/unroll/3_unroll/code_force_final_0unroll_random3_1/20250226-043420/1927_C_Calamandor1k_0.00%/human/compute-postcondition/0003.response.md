Functionality: **The function accepts integers `n` and `m` representing the lengths of arrays `a` and `b` respectively, an even integer `k` such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), and arrays `a` and `b` consisting of integers where 1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6. The function returns a specific value based on the provided arrays and integer `k`. Case_1: If the conditions are met, it returns the calculated result based on the arrays and `k`. Case_2: If the conditions are not met, it handles the scenario accordingly (the specific handling is not detailed in the provided information).**
