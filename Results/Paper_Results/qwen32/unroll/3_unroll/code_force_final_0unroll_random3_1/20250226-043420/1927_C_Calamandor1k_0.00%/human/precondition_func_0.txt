For each test case, n and m are integers representing the lengths of arrays a and b respectively, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5. k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m). Arrays a and b consist of integers where 1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6 for all valid indices i and j. The total sum of n and m across all test cases does not exceed 4·10^5. The number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
