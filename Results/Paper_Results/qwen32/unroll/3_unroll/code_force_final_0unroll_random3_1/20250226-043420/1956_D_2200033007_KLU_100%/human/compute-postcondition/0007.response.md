The code snippet appends a tuple `(start_index, start_index)` to the list `res`. The values of `i`, `start_index`, and `is_already_stairs` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer representing an index in the array `arr`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer representing the starting index of the subarray in `arr` that the function is currently processing, `is_already_stairs` is `False`, and `res` contains the tuple `(start_index, start_index)`.**
