You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `make_stairs` modifies a subarray of `arr` starting from `start_index` to ensure that the subarray represents a "staircase" pattern where each element at index `start_index + j` is equal to `j`. If the subarray does not already meet this condition, it appends tuples to the list `res` indicating the ranges that were modified, and updates the subarray elements accordingly. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

The problem requires maximizing the sum of an array `a` by performing a series of operations where each operation replaces a subarray with its MEX (Minimum EXcluded value). The goal is to find the maximum possible sum and the sequence of operations that achieves this sum.

### Analysis of the Provided Program

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the maximum possible sum for a subarray defined by `start_index` to `end_index`.
   - It uses dynamic programming with memoization (`res_dict`) to store results of subproblems.
   - The function considers three cases:
     - When the subarray length is 1, it returns the maximum of 1 and the current value of the element.
     - When the entire subarray can be turned into a sequence of consecutive integers from 0 to `length - 1` (which would maximize the sum to `length^2`).
     - It recursively considers splitting the subarray into smaller parts and calculates the maximum sum for each split, including the case where the MEX is used.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function constructs the sequence of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.
   - It uses the results from `func_1` to determine the optimal splits and operations.
   - It handles the base case where the subarray length is 1 and checks if the subarray can be turned into a sequence of consecutive integers.

3. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - This function is supposed to transform a subarray into a sequence of consecutive integers from 0 to `i`.
   - However, it has a critical issue: it uses a global `start_index` variable which is not defined within the function and causes a `NameError`. This function also modifies the global `arr` and `res` variables directly, which is not ideal for a recursive function.

### Issues and Corrections

- **Global Variables**: The use of global variables `start_index`, `arr`, and `res` within `make_stairs` is problematic. These should be passed as parameters to the function.
- **Logic for `make_stairs`**: The logic for transforming a subarray into a sequence of consecutive integers is correct, but it needs to be fixed to work properly without relying on global variables.
- **Memoization**: The memoization in `func_1` is efficient, but it should ensure that the recursive calls are correctly structured to avoid redundant calculations.

### Correctness

Given the issues with the `make_stairs` function and the reliance on global variables, the program as written is not correct. It will not run as intended and will likely produce incorrect results due to the `NameError`.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**

The program needs fixing to properly handle the transformation of subarrays and to avoid the use of global variables within recursive functions.
