### Reasoning:

The provided program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs`. These functions are designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of an array by performing a series of operations that replace subarrays with their MEX (Minimum Excluded Value).

Here's a breakdown of what each function does:

1. **`func_1(start_index, end_index)`**:
   - This function calculates the maximum possible sum of the subarray from `start_index` to `end_index` by recursively considering different ways to split the subarray and calculating the MEX for each split.
   - It uses memoization (`res_dict`) to store and reuse the results of previously computed subarrays.
   - The function correctly computes the maximum sum by considering all possible splits and combining the results.

2. **`func_2(start_index, end_index)`**:
   - This function generates the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`.
   - It recursively splits the subarray and determines the operations needed to transform the subarray into the configuration that yields the maximum sum.
   - The function correctly identifies the subarrays to be modified and returns the sequence of operations.

3. **`make_stairs(i)`**:
   - This function modifies a subarray to form a "staircase" pattern, where each element at index `start_index + j` is equal to `j`.
   - It appends the necessary operations to the list `res` and updates the subarray elements accordingly.
   - The function ensures that the subarray is transformed into the desired pattern.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Correctness of `func_1`**:
  - The function correctly computes the maximum possible sum by considering all possible splits and calculating the MEX for each split.
  - It uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations, which is efficient given the constraints.

- **Correctness of `func_2`**:
  - The function generates the sequence of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.
  - It correctly identifies the subarrays to be modified and returns the sequence of operations.
  - The function handles different cases based on the length of the subarray and the values within it.

- **Correctness of `make_stairs`**:
  - The function modifies a subarray to form a "staircase" pattern.
  - It appends the necessary operations to the list `res` and updates the subarray elements accordingly.
  - The function ensures that the subarray is transformed into the desired pattern.

### Conclusion:

The program is designed to solve the problem correctly by calculating the maximum possible sum and generating the sequence of operations needed to achieve that sum. Each function plays a specific role in achieving this goal, and the program as a whole meets the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
