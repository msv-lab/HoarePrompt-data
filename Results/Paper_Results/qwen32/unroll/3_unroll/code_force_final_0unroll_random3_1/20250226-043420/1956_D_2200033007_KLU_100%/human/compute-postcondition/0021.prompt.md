You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is a non-negative integer representing an index in the array arr, and start_index is a non-negative integer representing the starting index of the subarray in arr that the function is currently processing.
def make_stairs(i):
    is_already_stairs = True
    for j in range(i + 1):
        if arr[start_index + j] != j:
            is_already_stairs = False
        
    #State: `i` is a non-negative integer representing an index in the array `arr`, and `start_index` is a non-negative integer representing the starting index of the subarray in `arr` that the function is currently processing; `is_already_stairs` is `True` if all elements in the subarray from `arr[start_index]` to `arr[start_index + i]` satisfy `arr[start_index + j] == j` for all `j` in the range from `0` to `i`, otherwise `is_already_stairs` is `False`.
    if is_already_stairs :
        return
        #The program returns nothing (None)
    #State: `i` is a non-negative integer representing an index in the array `arr`, and `start_index` is a non-negative integer representing the starting index of the subarray in `arr` that the function is currently processing; `is_already_stairs` is `False`, indicating that not all elements in the subarray from `arr[start_index]` to `arr[start_index + i]` satisfy `arr[start_index + j] == j` for all `j` in the range from `0` to `i`.
    if (i == 0) :
        res.append((start_index, start_index))
        arr[start_index] = 1
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: `i` is a non-negative integer representing an index in the array `arr`, and `start_index` is a non-negative integer representing the starting index of the subarray in `arr` that the function is currently processing; `is_already_stairs` is `False`, indicating that not all elements in the subarray from `arr[start_index]` to `arr[start_index + i]` satisfy `arr[start_index + j] == j` for all `j` in the range from `0` to `i`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0.
    if (arr[start_index + i] == i) :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    else :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
        res.append((start_index, start_index + i))
        for j in range(start_index, start_index + i + 1):
            arr[j] = i
            
        #State: `i` is a non-negative integer representing an index in the array `arr`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer representing the starting index of the subarray in `arr` that the function is currently processing, `is_already_stairs` is `False`, indicating that not all elements in the subarray from `arr[start_index]` to `arr[start_index + i]` satisfy `arr[start_index + j] == j` for all `j` in the range from `0` to `i`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0. The element `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i` (although all elements from `arr[start_index]` to `arr[start_index + i]` have been set to `i` by the loop). The function `make_stairs` has been called with the argument `i - 1`. The list `res` now includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`.
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    #State: `i` is a non-negative integer representing an index in the array `arr`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer representing the starting index of the subarray in `arr` that the function is currently processing, and `is_already_stairs` is `False`. The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called. If `arr[start_index + i]` equals `i`, no additional changes are made to `res`. Otherwise, `res` includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` and any changes made by the recursive call `make_stairs(i - 1)` to `res`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `make_stairs` accepts a parameter `i`, which is a non-negative integer representing an index in the array `arr`, and a parameter `start_index`, which is a non-negative integer representing the starting index of the subarray in `arr` that the function is currently processing. The function does not return anything in any case.

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing (None)

Case_2: The program returns nothing.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
