Postcondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100), where `n` is the number of moves Nikita can make and `m` is the desired number of cubes in the tower. For each test case, if the difference between `n` and `m` is non-negative and even, the current test case satisfies the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0`. Otherwise, either `n - m` is not divisible by 2 or `n - m` is less than 0.**
