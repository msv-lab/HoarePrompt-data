You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it determines if the difference between `n` and `m` is non-negative and even, printing "Yes" if true and "No" otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
Nikita can perform two types of moves:
1. Add exactly 1 cube to the tower.
2. Remove exactly 1 cube from the tower.

We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

#### Key Observations:
- Each move changes the number of cubes by ±1.
- Therefore, after `n` moves, the number of cubes can only be an integer that is `n` moves away from the initial state (0 cubes), i.e., the number of cubes can be any integer `k` such that `|k| <= n`.
- To have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, `m` must be reachable from 0 in `n` moves. This means `m` must be within the range `[-n, n]`.
- Additionally, since each move changes the number of cubes by 1, the parity (oddness or evenness) of the number of cubes must match the parity of `n`. Specifically, `m` and `n` must have the same parity (both odd or both even) because an even number of moves can only change the parity of the number of cubes an even number of times, and an odd number of moves can only change the parity an odd number of times.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases `kreker` and iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m` and checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0`.

- The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` checks if `n` and `m` have the same parity.
- The condition `n - m >= 0` ensures that `m` is not greater than `n` (since `m` cannot be greater than `n` moves away from 0).

However, the condition `n - m >= 0` is not necessary to determine if `m` is reachable from 0 in `n` moves. The correct condition should simply be `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `m <= n` (since `m` cannot be greater than `n`).

#### Conclusion:
The provided program is almost correct, but it has an unnecessary condition `n - m >= 0`. It should be `m <= n` instead. However, since `m` is guaranteed to be non-negative (as per the problem constraints `1 ≤ m`), the condition `n - m >= 0` is effectively ensuring `m <= n` in this specific context. Therefore, the program is still correct for the given problem constraints.
