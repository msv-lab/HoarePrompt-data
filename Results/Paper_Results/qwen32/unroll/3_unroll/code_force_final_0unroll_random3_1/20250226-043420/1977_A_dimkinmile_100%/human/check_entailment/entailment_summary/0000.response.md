Reasoning:
The problem requires determining if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove exactly one cube. The key insight is that the difference between `n` and `m` must be non-negative and even for it to be possible to achieve exactly `m` cubes. This is because:
- If `n - m` is negative, it means more cubes need to be added than removed, which is impossible with `n` moves.
- If `n - m` is positive and odd, it means there would be one leftover operation (either an addition or a removal) after trying to balance the operations to reach `m` cubes, which is also impossible.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking if `n - m` is non-negative and even. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No". The function `func_1` is called for each test case, and the program reads the correct number of test cases from the input.

Correctness: **True**
