Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
