Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, which is a list of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function returns a list named `results` containing `t` integers, where each integer represents the number of operations performed for the corresponding test case.**
