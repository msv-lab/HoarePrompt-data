You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers.

The median of an array q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_k is the number p_{\lceil
\frac{k}{2} \rceil} , where p is the array q sorted in non-decreasing order.
For example, the median of the array [9, 5, 1, 2, 6] is 5 , as in the sorted
array [1, 2, 5, 6, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 is 5
, and the median of the array [9, 2, 8, 3] is 3 , as in the sorted array [2,
3, 8, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 is 3 .

You are allowed to choose an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) and increase a_i by 1
in one operation.

Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the
median of the array.

Note that the array a may not necessarily contain distinct numbers.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations
required to increase the median of the array.

Note

In the first test case, you can apply one operation to the first number and
obtain the array [3, 2, 8] , the median of this array is 3 , as it is the
number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 3, 8] . The median of the original array [2, 2, 8] is 2 , as it is
the number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 2, 8] . Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in just one operation.

In the fourth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 2, 3 and obtain the array [6, 6, 6, 4, 5] , the median of this
array is 6 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 6, 6, 6] . The median of the original array
[5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil
= 2 in the non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 5, 5, 5] . Thus, the median
increased (6 > 5 ) in three operations. It can be shown that this is the
minimum possible number of operations.

In the fifth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 3 and obtain the array [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4] , the median of this
array is 3 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 4] . The median of the original
array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2 , as it is the number at index \lceil
\frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4] .
Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in two operations. It can be shown that
this is the minimum possible number of operations.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the number of operations needed to ensure that the smallest element in the list is greater than the median of the list. The function returns a list of `t` integers, where each integer represents the number of operations performed for the corresponding test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap
The task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of an array. An operation consists of increasing any element of the array by 1.

### Provided Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the input in one go and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes each test case by reading the number of elements `n` and the array `arr` for each test case.
   - This part is correctly implemented.

2. **Sorting and Median Calculation:**
   - For each test case, the array is sorted.
   - The median index is calculated as `n // 2`.
   - The current median is taken as the element at the median index.
   - This part is also correctly implemented for finding the median.

3. **Heap Operations:**
   - A heap is created from the elements starting from the median index to the end of the array.
   - The program uses a while loop to keep increasing the smallest element in the heap until it becomes greater than the current median.
   - The number of operations required to do this is counted and stored as the result for each test case.
   - This part is not entirely correct. The program only considers the elements from the median index to the end of the array. However, to increase the median, we need to consider the entire array and potentially increase elements that are smaller than the current median, not just those from the median index onwards.

### Correctness Evaluation
The provided program incorrectly assumes that only the elements from the median index onwards need to be considered for increasing the median. This is not necessarily true. For example, if the array is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 10]`, the median is `1`, but to increase the median, we need to increase the smaller elements, not just the `10`.

### Correct Approach
A correct approach would involve:
1. Sorting the array.
2. Calculating the median.
3. Using a min-heap to keep track of the smallest elements.
4. Increasing the smallest elements until the median increases.

However, the provided program does not correctly implement this. It only considers elements from the median index onwards, which is not sufficient.

### Conclusion
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly account for all elements that need to be increased to raise the median.

Correctness: **False**
