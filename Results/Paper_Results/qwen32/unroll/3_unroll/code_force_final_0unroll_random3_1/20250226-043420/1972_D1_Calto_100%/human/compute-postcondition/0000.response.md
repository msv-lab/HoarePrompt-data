The `while` loop in the given task is `while b:`. In Python, a non-zero integer is considered `True` in a boolean context, and a zero is considered `False`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `b` must be a non-zero integer.

Given the state right before the loop is that `a` and `b` are positive integers, `b` is already a non-zero integer by definition. This means no adjustment is needed for `b` to ensure the loop can execute.

Thus, the state remains unchanged.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers**.
