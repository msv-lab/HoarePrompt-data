To determine the state before the for loop starts, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means we need to ensure that the input provided to the loop can be processed correctly.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Input Handling**: The loop will iterate `int(input())` times. This means we need to ensure that the input to the `input()` function is a valid integer within the specified range (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5).

2. **Loop Variable**: The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted in terms of state. It simply iterates over the range provided by `int(input())`.

Given this, the only state we need to adjust is the input to the `input()` function to ensure the loop can execute correctly. Specifically, we need to ensure that the input is an integer within the range [2, 10^5].

State: **The input to `input()` function must be an integer `n` such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5.**
