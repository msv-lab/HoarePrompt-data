Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to check if three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle. The program only calculates the number of ways to choose three sticks of the same length or two sticks of the same length and one different stick, which does not guarantee that the chosen sticks can form a triangle.

To form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. The given program does not check this condition.

Let's consider an example where the program will fail:

**Input:**
```
1
3
0 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation:**
The lengths of the sticks are \(2^0 = 1\), \(2^1 = 2\), and \(2^2 = 4\). The only combination is (1, 2, 4), but this cannot form a triangle because \(1 + 2 \not> 4\).

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
1
```

The program incorrectly assumes that any combination of sticks, even if they are of different lengths, can form a triangle if they meet the conditions of having the same or different lengths in a specific pattern. This is not correct.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
