The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `buffer`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `a`. Therefore, the initial state of `t`, `n`, and `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `buffer` is an empty list.**
