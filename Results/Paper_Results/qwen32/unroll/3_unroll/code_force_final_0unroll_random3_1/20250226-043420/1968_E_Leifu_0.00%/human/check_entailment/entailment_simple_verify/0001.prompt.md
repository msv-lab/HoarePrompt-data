You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to find a set of `n` points in an `n x n` grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of points is maximized.

### Provided Program Analysis

The program reads `t` test cases, and for each test case, it outputs `n` points according to a specific pattern. Here is a detailed breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Output Generation:**
   - For `n = 2`, the program outputs the points `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`.
   - For `n = 3`, the program outputs the points `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(2, 3)`.
   - For `n >= 4`, the program outputs the points `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, and then `(j, j)` for `j` from `4` to `n`.

### Verification of the Output

Let's verify the output for the given examples and check if the program maximizes the set of distinct Manhattan distances:

1. **For `n = 2`:**
   - Points: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`
   - Distances: `|1-1|+|1-1| = 0`, `|1-1|+|2-2| = 0`, `|1-1|+|1-2| = 1`
   - Distinct distances: `{0, 1}`

2. **For `n = 3`:**
   - Points: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 3)`
   - Distances: `|1-1|+|1-1| = 0`, `|1-1|+|2-2| = 0`, `|2-2|+|3-3| = 0`, `|1-1|+|1-2| = 1`, `|1-1|+|2-3| = 3`, `|1-2|+|2-3| = 2`
   - Distinct distances: `{0, 1, 2, 3}`

3. **For `n = 4`:**
   - Points: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, `(4, 4)`
   - Distances: `|1-1|+|1-1| = 0`, `|1-1|+|2-2| = 0`, `|2-2|+|4-4| = 0`, `|1-1|+|1-2| = 1`, `|1-1|+|2-4| = 3`, `|1-1|+|4-4| = 5`, `|1-2|+|2-4| = 2`, `|1-2|+|4-4| = 4`, `|2-4|+|4-4| = 2`
   - Distinct distances: `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`

4. **For `n = 5`:**
   - Points: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, `(4, 4)`, `(5, 5)`
   - Distances: `|1-1|+|1-1| = 0`, `|1-1|+|2-2| = 0`, `|2-2|+|4-4| = 0`, `|4-4|+|5-5| = 0`, `|1-1|+|1-2| = 1`, `|1-1|+|2-4| = 3`, `|1-1|+|4-4| = 5`, `|1-1|+|5-5| = 7`, `|1-2|+|2-4| = 2`, `|1-2|+|4-4| = 4`, `|1-2|+|5-5| = 6`, `|2-4|+|4-4| = 2`, `|2-4|+|5-5| = 4`, `|4-4|+|5-5| = 2`
   - Distinct distances: `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}`

5. **For `n = 6`:**
   - Points: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, `(4, 4)`, `(5, 5)`, `(6, 6)`
   - Distances: `|1-1|+|1-1| = 0`, `|1-1|+|2-2| = 0`, `|2-2|+|4-4| = 0`, `|4-4|+|5-5| = 0`, `|5-5|+|6-6| = 0`, `|1-1|+|1-2| = 1`, `|1-1|+|2-4| = 3`, `|1-1|+|4-4| = 5`, `|1-1|+|5-5| = 7`, `|1-1|+|6-6| = 9`, `|1-2|+|2-4| = 2`, `|1-2|+|4-4| = 4`, `|1-2|+|5-5| = 6`, `|1-2|+|6-6| = 8`, `|2-4|+|4-4| = 2`, `|2-4|+|5-5| = 4`, `|2-4|+|6-6| = 6`, `|4-4|+|5-5| = 2`, `|4-4|+|6-6| = 4`, `|5-5|+|6-6| = 2`
   - Distinct distances: `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}`

### Conclusion

The program generates points that result in a set of distinct Manhattan distances for each `n`. However, the program does not necessarily generate the optimal set of points for maximizing the distinct distances for all `n`. For example, for `n = 4`, `n = 5`, and `n = 6`, the program does not always generate the maximum number of distinct distances as shown in the problem's example solutions.
