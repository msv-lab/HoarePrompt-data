To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to analyze the loop and understand what it does for each test case.

The provided code snippet consists of an outer loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the code performs the following steps:
1. Reads an integer `n` from the input.
2. Prints two lines: '1 1' and '1 2'.
3. Checks if `n` is equal to 3:
   - If true, prints '2 3'.
   - If false, prints '2 4' and then enters an inner loop.
4. The inner loop runs from `j = 4` to `j = n`, printing 'j j' for each `j`.

Given that `n` is at least 2, the loop will always print '1 1' and '1 2'. Depending on the value of `n`, it will print either '2 3' or '2 4' followed by a series of 'j j' values.

The output state after all iterations will be a series of printed lines corresponding to each test case. Since the output is printed and not stored in variables, the state of the variables `t` and `n` remains unchanged in terms of their values. However, the output will be a concatenation of the printed lines for each test case.

Output State: **The output will be a series of printed lines for each test case. For each test case, the output will start with '1 1' and '1 2'. If `n` is 3, it will be followed by '2 3'. Otherwise, it will be followed by '2 4' and then 'j j' for each `j` from 4 to `n`.**
