Reasoning:  
The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the code does not accurately determine the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party based on the conditions given.

The program checks if there exists an index `i` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`, which does not correspond to any meaningful condition based on the problem statement. According to the problem, a friend `i` will come to the party if both `i` and `p_i` (the best friend of `i`) receive invitations. The program does not check for this condition and instead uses a condition that is unrelated to the problem requirements.

The correct approach would involve checking pairs of friends and their best friends to determine the minimum number of invitations needed. For example, in the first test case, the program should determine that inviting friends 4 and 5 is sufficient, which would result in both of them attending the party. However, the current code does not perform this check and instead prints '2' based on the incorrect condition.

Correctness: **False**
