You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it prints '2' if there exists an index `i` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`, otherwise it prints '3'. The function does not modify the input values `n` or `p` and outputs a series of '2's and '3's corresponding to each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Logic Error in Loop**:
   - The inner loop in the program is intended to find pairs of friends who are each other's best friends, but the condition `if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is incorrect. This condition checks if the best friend of the i-th friend is the same as the i-th friend's index minus one, which is not the correct way to check if two friends are each other's best friends.
   - The correct condition should be checking if `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` because `l[i] - 1` is the index of the best friend of the i-th friend, and `i + 1` should be the value at that index if they are each other's best friends.

2. **Handling of Cases**:
   - The program incorrectly assumes that if it finds one pair of friends who are each other's best friends, it can immediately print `2` and break out of the loop. However, this might not be the minimum number of invitations needed in all cases.
   - The program does not handle cases where there are no such pairs correctly, and it incorrectly prints `3` in such cases.

3. **Example Case**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     5
     3 1 2 5 4
     ```
     According to the problem, Monocarp can invite friends 4 and 5, and both will come to the party. However, the program will not correctly identify this pair and might print `3` instead.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - A correct approach would involve identifying all pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and then calculating the minimum number of invitations needed based on these pairs and other conditions.

Given these issues, the current program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases, hence it is incorrect.
