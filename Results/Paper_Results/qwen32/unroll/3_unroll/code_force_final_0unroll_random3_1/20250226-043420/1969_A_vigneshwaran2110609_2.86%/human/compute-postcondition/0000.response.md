The code snippet provided reads an integer value from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This will overwrite the previous value of `n` with the new input value. The other variables `t` and `p` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i != i.**
