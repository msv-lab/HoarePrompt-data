You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.

    #State: 
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on whether `n` is odd or even and the relative values of `a` and `b`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to ensure it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Program Analysis

The problem requires calculating the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts, considering both the regular price `a` and the promotion price `b` for two yogurts.

Here's a breakdown of the program logic:
1. For each test case:
   - Read the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - If `n` is odd:
     - If `2 * a` (buying two yogurts at regular price) is less than `b` (promotion price for two yogurts), then buy all yogurts at the regular price.
     - Otherwise, buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt at the regular price.
   - If `n` is even:
     - If `2 * a` is less than `b`, then buy all yogurts at the regular price.
     - Otherwise, buy all yogurts at the promotion price.

### Potential Edge Cases

1. **When `n` is 1**:
   - The program should correctly handle the case where `n` is 1 by checking if buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than the promotion price. Since `n` is 1, it should always buy it at the regular price `a`.

2. **When `n` is 2**:
   - If `2 * a < b`, it should buy two yogurts at the regular price.
   - If `2 * a >= b`, it should buy two yogurts at the promotion price.

3. **When `n` is greater than 2**:
   - The program should correctly handle both odd and even values of `n` by buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt at the regular price if `n` is odd.

### Verification of Edge Cases

Let's test the program with some edge cases:

1. **Test Case: `n = 1`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`**
   - Expected output: `5` (since buying one yogurt at regular price is cheaper than buying two at the promotion price).
   - Program output: `5` (correct).

2. **Test Case: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`**
   - Expected output: `9` (since buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying two at the regular price).
   - Program output: `9` (correct).

3. **Test Case: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`**
   - Expected output: `10` (since buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than buying two at the promotion price).
   - Program output: `10` (correct).

4. **Test Case: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`**
   - Expected output: `14` (buy two yogurts at the promotion price and one at the regular price).
   - Program output: `14` (correct).

5. **Test Case: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`**
   - Expected output: `15` (buy all three yogurts at the regular price).
   - Program output: `15` (correct).

6. **Test Case: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`**
   - Expected output: `20` (buy two pairs of yogurts at the regular price).
   - Program output: `20` (correct).

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly handles all the edge cases and the example cases provided in the problem statement. It correctly calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts based on the given conditions.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly handles both odd and even values of `n` by comparing the cost of buying yogurts at the regular price versus the promotion price. It ensures that the minimum cost is calculated for every test case.
