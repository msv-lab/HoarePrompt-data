### Reasoning:

The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, where for each test case, it calculates the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts given the prices `a` and `b`. The logic considers whether `n` is odd or even and whether buying two yogurts at the promotion price `b` or individually at the price `a` is cheaper.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **For even `n`:**
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than the promotion. Therefore, the total cost is `n * a`.
   - Otherwise, it's more cost-effective to buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price, so the total cost is `(n // 2) * b`.

2. **For odd `n`:**
   - If `2 * a < b`, again, buying two yogurts individually is cheaper. Therefore, the total cost is `n * a`.
   - Otherwise, the optimal strategy is to buy `(n // 2)` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and one yogurt individually, so the total cost is `(n // 2) * b + a`.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of `n` and comparing `2 * a` with `b` to determine the minimum cost.

### Correctness:
The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case based on the given conditions. It handles both even and odd values of `n` and compares the costs of buying yogurts individually versus in pairs.

**Correctness: True**
