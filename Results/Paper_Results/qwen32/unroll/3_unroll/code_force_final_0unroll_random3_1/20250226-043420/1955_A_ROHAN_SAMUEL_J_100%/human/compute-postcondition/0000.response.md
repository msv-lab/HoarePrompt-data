In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the input from the user, specifically the integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is provided as input. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are mentioned as being part of each test case, but they are not directly part of the loop head in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the only variable we can adjust to ensure the loop executes is `t`.

Given that `t` is already described as an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, the loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. Since the loop head only involves the variable `_` which is a throwaway variable and `t` which is provided by the input, we need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1**
