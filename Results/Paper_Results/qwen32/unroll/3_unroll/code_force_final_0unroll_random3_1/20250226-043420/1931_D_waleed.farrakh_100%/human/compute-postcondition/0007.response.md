Output State: **`n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the last test case processed, `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing all test cases, `idx` is `1 + 2*t`, `results` is the output of `func_1(test_cases)`**

Explanation: The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `test_cases`, and `idx` remain unchanged from the initial state. The new variable `results` is introduced and assigned the value returned by the function `func_1(test_cases)`.
