The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since `_` is just a placeholder for the loop variable and does not need to be adjusted, the only variable that needs to be considered is `t`.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The current state specifies that `t` is an integer equal to the first element of `data` converted to an integer. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers of length n where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `input` is a list of strings where each string is a line from the input; `t` is an integer equal to the first element of `data` converted to an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `test_cases` is an empty list, `idx` is 1**
