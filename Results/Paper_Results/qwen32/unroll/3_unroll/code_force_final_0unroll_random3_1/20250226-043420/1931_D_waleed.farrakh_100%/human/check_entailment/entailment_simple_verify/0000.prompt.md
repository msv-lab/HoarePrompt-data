You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the logic and verify it against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
- We need to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array `a` for each test case.
- A pair `(i, j)` is beautiful if:
  - `a[i] + a[j]` is divisible by `x`
  - `a[i] - a[j]` is divisible by `y`

### Provided Program Analysis
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(test_cases)`: This function processes the test cases and calculates the number of beautiful pairs for each.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads input from standard input, parses it, and calls `func_1` to get the results, which it then prints.

#### `func_1` Analysis
- The function iterates over each test case and initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` to keep track of pairs `(rx, ry)` where:
  - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` (This ensures that `rx` is always non-negative)
  - `ry = a % y`
- For each element `a` in the array:
  - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the frequency dictionary and adds the count to the total.
  - It then updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.

#### `func_2` Analysis
- This function reads the input, parses the test cases, and calls `func_1` to process them.
- It then prints the results for each test case.

### Verification
Let's verify if the logic in `func_1` correctly identifies beautiful pairs:
- For each element `a` in the array, the program calculates:
  - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` which is equivalent to `a % x` (since `-a % x` is the same as `(x - a % x) % x` when adjusted to be non-negative).
  - `ry = a % y`
- It then checks if `(rx, ry)` has been seen before and counts the number of such pairs.
- The frequency dictionary is updated with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.

### Edge Cases
- **Single Element in Array**: Since `i < j` must hold, no beautiful pairs exist for `n = 1`.
- **All Elements Same**: If all elements are the same, the pairs `(a % x, a % y)` will be the same, and the program should correctly count all valid pairs.
- **Large Values**: The program should handle large values of `n`, `x`, and `y` as specified in the constraints.

### Conclusion
The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies beautiful pairs based on the conditions provided in the problem description. The program handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the number of beautiful pairs for each test case by using a frequency dictionary to keep track of pairs `(a % x, a % y)` and checking if the conditions for beautiful pairs are met. It handles all edge cases and constraints specified in the problem description.
