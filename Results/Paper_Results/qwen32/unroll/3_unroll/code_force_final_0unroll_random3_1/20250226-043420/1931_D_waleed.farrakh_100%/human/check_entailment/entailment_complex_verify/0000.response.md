### Reasoning:

The original assessment provides a detailed breakdown of the program logic and verifies that the program correctly identifies beautiful pairs based on the given problem description. Let's systematically evaluate the program using the annotated code to ensure the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to find pairs `(i, j)` such that:
  - `a[i] + a[j]` is divisible by `x`.
  - `a[i] - a[j]` is divisible by `y`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(test_cases)`**:
   - **Initialization**: `freq` is a dictionary to keep track of pairs `(rx, ry)`.
   - **Loop through each element `a` in `arr`**:
     - **Calculate `rx`**: `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` which simplifies to `rx = a % x` because `(-a % x + x) % x` is equivalent to `a % x`.
     - **Calculate `ry`**: `ry = a % y`.
     - **Check if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`**:
       - If it is, add the count of `(rx, ry)` to `count`.
     - **Update `freq`**: Increment the count of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`.
   - **Append the count of beautiful pairs for this test case to `results`**.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - **Read and parse input**:
     - Read the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, read `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
     - Store each test case as a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` in `test_cases`.
   - **Call `func_1(test_cases)`** to get the results.
   - **Print each result**.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations confirm that the program correctly processes each test case, calculates the necessary remainders, and uses a frequency dictionary to count beautiful pairs.
- The state annotations indicate that `freq` keeps track of the pairs `(a % x, a % y)` and that `count` is updated correctly based on these pairs.

#### Verification:
- **Correctness of Remainder Calculation**:
  - `rx = a % x` and `ry = a % y` are correctly calculated for each element.
- **Counting Pairs**:
  - The program checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` has been seen before and adds the count to the total.
  - The frequency dictionary is updated with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles cases where all elements are the same.
  - The program handles cases with large values of `n`, `x`, and `y` as specified in the constraints.

#### Conclusion:
The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies beautiful pairs based on the conditions provided in the problem description. The program handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately. The annotations support the original assessment, confirming that the program is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**.
