The only object in the loop head is the variable `result`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the `results` list has at least one element, the loop can execute. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `test_cases`, and `idx` are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

To ensure that the loop executes, `results` must have at least one element. Therefore, the state should be adjusted to reflect that `results` is a list with at least one element.

State: **`n`, `x`, `y`, `arr` are the values from the last test case processed, `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing all test cases, `idx` is `1 + 2*t`, `results` is a list with at least one element**
