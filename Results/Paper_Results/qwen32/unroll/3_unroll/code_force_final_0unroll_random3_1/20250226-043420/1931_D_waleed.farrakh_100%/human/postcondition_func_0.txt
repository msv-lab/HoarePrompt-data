The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n`, two positive integers `x` and `y`, and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It calculates and returns a list containing the count of pairs of elements in each `arr` that have the same remainders when divided by `x` and `y`.
