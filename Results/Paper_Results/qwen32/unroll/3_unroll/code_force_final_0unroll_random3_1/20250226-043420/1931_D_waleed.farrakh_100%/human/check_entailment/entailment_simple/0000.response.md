### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to verify if the logic implemented in `func_1` correctly identifies and counts the "beautiful pairs" as defined in the problem statement.

#### **Understanding the Problem:**

A pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) (where \(1 \le i < j \le n\)) is considered "beautiful" if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

These conditions can be mathematically rephrased using modular arithmetic:
- \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) implies \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\).
- \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\) implies \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\).

#### **Analyzing the Provided Code:**

The code uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs of remainders \((r_x, r_y)\), where:
- \(r_x = (-a_i \mod x + x) \mod x\) (ensuring a non-negative remainder).
- \(r_y = a_i \mod y\).

For each element \(a_i\) in the array:
1. It computes the corresponding remainders \((r_x, r_y)\).
2. It checks if the pair \((r_x, r_y)\) has been seen before in the array. If it has, it adds the frequency of this pair to the count of beautiful pairs.
3. It updates the frequency of the current pair \((r_x, r_y)\) in the dictionary.

#### **Verification:**

- **Correctness of Remainder Calculation:**
  - The calculation of \(r_x = (-a_i \mod x + x) \mod x\) ensures that the remainder is always non-negative and within the range \([0, x-1]\).
  - The calculation of \(r_y = a_i \mod y\) is straightforward and correct.

- **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
  - When the code checks if \((r_x, r_y)\) is in `freq`, it is essentially checking if there are any previous elements \(a_j\) (where \(j < i\)) such that:
    - \(a_j \equiv -a_i \pmod{x}\) (i.e., \(a_j\) has the same \(r_x\)).
    - \(a_j \equiv a_i \pmod{y}\) (i.e., \(a_j\) has the same \(r_y\)).
  - If such elements exist, they form beautiful pairs with the current element \(a_i\).

- **Efficiency:**
  - The algorithm processes each element of the array in linear time \(O(n)\) per test case, making it efficient given the constraints (\(n \leq 2 \times 10^5\)).

#### **Conclusion:**

The provided code correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. The remainder calculations and the use of a dictionary to track frequencies ensure that the conditions for beautiful pairs are accurately checked and counted.

### Your response:

Reasoning: The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs by using the remainders of the array elements when divided by \(x\) and \(y\). It efficiently tracks the frequency of these remainders and counts pairs that satisfy the given conditions.
Correctness: **True**
