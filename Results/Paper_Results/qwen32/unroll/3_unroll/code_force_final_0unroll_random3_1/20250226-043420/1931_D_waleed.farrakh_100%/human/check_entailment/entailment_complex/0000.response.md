### Reasoning:

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires identifying the number of "beautiful pairs" in an array. A pair \((a_i, a_j)\) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

#### Approach in the Code:
1. **Input Parsing (`func_2`)**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - It stores each test case in a list `test_cases` as a tuple \((n, x, y, arr)\).
   - It then passes `test_cases` to `func_1`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case (`func_1`)**:
   - For each test case, it initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of pairs of remainders \((rx, ry)\).
   - It iterates over each element `a` in the array `arr`:
     - Computes `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x` (this ensures a non-negative remainder).
     - Computes `ry` as `a % y`.
     - If the pair \((rx, ry)\) exists in `freq`, it adds the count of this pair to `count`.
     - Updates the frequency of the current pair \((a % x, a % y)\) in `freq`.
   - After processing all elements, it appends the `count` of beautiful pairs to the `results` list.

3. **Output (`func_2`)**:
   - It prints the results for each test case.

#### Verification Against Problem Requirements:
- **Correctness of Remainder Calculation**:
  - The calculation of `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x` ensures that the remainder is always non-negative, which is necessary for correct dictionary key usage.
  - `ry` is simply `a % y`, which is also correct.
  
- **Logic for Counting Pairs**:
  - The logic of checking if a pair \((rx, ry)\) exists in `freq` and adding its count to `count` is correct. This ensures that for each element `a`, we are counting all previous elements that can form a beautiful pair with `a`.
  - The update of the frequency dictionary `freq` ensures that the count of each possible pair is maintained correctly.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The solution processes each element in the array in constant time, leading to an overall time complexity of \(O(n)\) per test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
