The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `test_cases`. None of the other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `input`, `t`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers of length n where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `input` is a list of strings where each string is a line from the input; `t` is an integer equal to the first element of `data` converted to an integer, `test_cases` is an empty list.**
