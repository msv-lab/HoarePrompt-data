Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`, and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it constructs a string `rev_res` by reversing selected integers from the list and comparing the resulting value to `10` raised to the power of `m`. It prints "Sasha" if the constructed value is greater than `10` raised to the power of `m`, otherwise it prints "Anna".**
