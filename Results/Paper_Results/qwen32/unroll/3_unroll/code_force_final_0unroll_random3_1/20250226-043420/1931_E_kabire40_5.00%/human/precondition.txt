t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, an integer m such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, and a list of n integers a_i such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
