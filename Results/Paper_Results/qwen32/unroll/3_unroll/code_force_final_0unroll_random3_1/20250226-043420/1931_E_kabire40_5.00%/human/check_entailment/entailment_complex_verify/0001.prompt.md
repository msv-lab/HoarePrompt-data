You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

    #State: The output state consists of `t` lines, each containing either "Sasha" or "Anna" based on the comparison of the constructed `rev_res` with `10
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`, and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it constructs a string `rev_res` by reversing selected integers from the list and comparing the resulting value to `10` raised to the power of `m`. It prints "Sasha" if the constructed value is greater than `10` raised to the power of `m`, otherwise it prints "Anna".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem involves a game where Anna and Sasha take turns manipulating a list of numbers. Anna reverses the digits of a number, while Sasha concatenates two numbers. The game ends when only one number remains in the list. Sasha wins if this number is at least \(10^m\); otherwise, Anna wins. Both players play optimally.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of integers) and `m` (the power of 10 Sasha needs to win).
   - It then reads the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. **Reversing Digits:**
   - The program iterates over each number in the list, reverses its digits, and checks if the length of the reversed number is the same as the original.
   - If the lengths are the same, it concatenates the reversed number to `rev_res`.
   - If the lengths differ (due to leading zeros being removed), it adds the reversed number to `rev_val`.

3. **Sorting and Concatenation:**
   - The program sorts the `rev_val` list.
   - It then iterates over `rev_val`, alternating between concatenating numbers directly and concatenating their reversed forms to `rev_res`.

4. **Win Condition Check:**
   - Finally, the program checks if the resulting number `rev_res` is at least \(10^m\). If so, it prints "Sasha"; otherwise, it prints "Anna".

### Issues with the Program

1. **Optimal Play:**
   - The program does not consider optimal play by either player. It simply concatenates numbers in a specific order without considering the best moves for Sasha or Anna.
   - For example, Sasha's strategy might involve concatenating the largest possible numbers first, while Anna might aim to minimize the final number by reversing digits strategically.

2. **Handling of Leading Zeros:**
   - The program correctly handles leading zeros by checking the length of the reversed number. However, this is not sufficient for determining the optimal strategy.

3. **Concatenation Strategy:**
   - The program concatenates numbers in an alternating pattern, which is not necessarily optimal for either player.

### Conclusion
Given the above points, the provided program does not correctly address the problem requirements, particularly the aspect of optimal play by both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer
Reasoning: The program does not implement an optimal strategy for either player and merely concatenates numbers in a fixed pattern, which does not guarantee the correct winner.
Correctness: **False**
