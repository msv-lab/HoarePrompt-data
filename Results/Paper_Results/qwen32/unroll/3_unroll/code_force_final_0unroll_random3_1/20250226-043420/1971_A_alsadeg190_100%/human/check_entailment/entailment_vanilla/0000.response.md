### Reasoning:
The task is to read a number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, read two integers `x` and `y`. The program should then output the minimum and maximum of these two integers.

Let's break down the provided program:

1. The first line `x = int(input())` reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. The `for` loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
3. Inside the loop, `(x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads two integers for each test case.
4. The `if` statement checks if `x < y`. If true, it prints `x` followed by `y`.
5. If the `if` condition is false, the `else` statement prints `y` followed by `x`.

The logic of the program correctly outputs the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` for each test case. If `x` is less than `y`, it prints `x` first and `y` second, which is the correct order (minimum first, maximum second). If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, it prints `y` first and `x` second, which is also the correct order.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem as described. It handles all possible cases of input values for `x` and `y` within the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
