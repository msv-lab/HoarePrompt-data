The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string elements, converts each of those string elements to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `arr`. The initial state of `t`, `n`, and `a` are not directly affected by this code, except that `a` is now defined as the list `arr` after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.**
