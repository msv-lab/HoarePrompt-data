Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description and the function summary to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
Farmer John has a permutation `p` of integers from `0` to `n-1`. Bessie is given an array `a` where each element `a_i` is defined as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The task is to reconstruct the permutation `p` from the array `a`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to reconstruct the permutation `p` from the array `a` as follows:

1. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `a` of `n` integers.
2. It initializes `minn` to `0` and `maxx` to `0`.
3. For each element in `a`:
   - If `a_i` is positive, it appends `minn` to the `mex` list and increments `minn`. If `minn` equals `maxx`, it increments `minn` again.
   - If `a_i` is non-positive, it appends `abs(a_i - minn)` to the `mex` list and updates `maxx` if necessary.
4. It prints the `mex` list as the permutation `p`.

### Function Summary Recap:
The function `func_1` processes each test case by reading `n` and `a`, then constructs a permutation `p` based on the logic described above and prints it.

### Issues in the Program:
The logic in the program does not correctly derive the permutation `p` from `a`. Specifically:
- The program does not accurately compute the MEX value for the current prefix of `p`.
- The handling of negative values in `a` is incorrect.

### Example Analysis:
Let's consider the provided test case:
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```
The expected output is:
```
0 1 4 2 3
```
Explanation:
- `a_1 = MEX([0]) - 0 = 1`
- `a_2 = MEX([0, 1]) - 1 = 1`
- `a_3 = MEX([0, 1, 4]) - 4 = -2`
- `a_4 = MEX([0, 1, 4, 2]) - 2 = 1`
- `a_5 = MEX([0, 1, 4, 2, 3]) - 3 = 2`

### Program Output:
Let's see how the program handles this test case:
- For `a_1 = 1` (positive), it appends `minn = 0` to `mex` and increments `minn` to `1`.
- For `a_2 = 1` (positive), it appends `minn = 1` to `mex` and increments `minn` to `2`.
- For `a_3 = -2` (non-positive), it appends `abs(-2 - 1) = 3` to `mex` and updates `maxx` to `3`.
- For `a_4 = 1` (positive), it appends `minn = 3` to `mex` and increments `minn` to `4`.
- For `a_5 = 2` (positive), it appends `minn = 4` to `mex` and increments `minn` to `5`.

The output of the program would be:
```
0 1 3 3 4
```
This is clearly incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly reconstruct the permutation `p` from the array `a` for all test cases. The logic for computing the MEX value and the permutation elements is flawed.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
