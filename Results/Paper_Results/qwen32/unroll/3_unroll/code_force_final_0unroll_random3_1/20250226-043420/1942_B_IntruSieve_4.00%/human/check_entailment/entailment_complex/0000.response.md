Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze how it constructs the permutation `p` given the array `a`. The key idea is to use the definition of the MEX (minimum non-negative integer not present in the array) to guide the construction of `p`.

The program iterates through the array `a` and constructs the permutation `p` based on the following logic:

1. If `a[i] > 0`, it assigns `minn` (the current smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `p`) to `p[i]`. Then, it increments `minn` to ensure it points to the next smallest non-negative integer not yet used.

2. If `a[i] <= 0`, it assigns `abs(a[i] - minn)` to `p[i]`. This step is intended to ensure that the MEX condition is satisfied with the given `a[i]`.

However, there are several issues with this approach:

- The logic for handling `a[i] <= 0` is flawed. The assignment `mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))` does not necessarily ensure that `p[i]` is a valid permutation element (i.e., a unique integer from 0 to n-1).
- The program does not maintain a set of used integers to ensure that each element in `p` is unique.
- The program does not correctly update `minn` and `maxx` in a way that guarantees the MEX condition is met for all elements of `p`.

To correctly construct `p`, the program should:

- Maintain a set of used integers to ensure each element in `p` is unique.
- Correctly calculate the MEX of the current prefix of `p` and use it to determine `p[i]` based on `a[i]`.

Given the issues in the provided program, it does not correctly construct the permutation `p` for all possible inputs as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
