Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by constructing a permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. The approach taken in the code is not entirely correct for deriving the permutation `p` from the array `a` as described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **MEX Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the MEX (Minimum EXcluded Value) in a way that does not align with the problem requirements. The MEX of a set of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set. The program uses a variable `minn` to keep track of the smallest non-negative integer not yet included, but it does not properly handle the case where elements in `a` are negative or when the MEX value needs to be recalculated after inserting a new element.

2. **Handling Negative Values in `a`**: The program incorrectly handles negative values in `a`. The formula `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is used to determine the value to append to the `mex` list, but this approach does not correctly reconstruct the permutation `p` as required. The correct approach should involve directly using the relationship between `a_i` and `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i)` to determine `p_i`.

3. **Updating MEX**: The program does not update the MEX value correctly when a new element is added to the permutation `p`. It should ensure that the MEX is recalculated based on the current elements of `p` after each insertion.

A correct solution would involve maintaining a set of used numbers and calculating the MEX dynamically as the permutation is constructed. Here is a corrected approach:

- Initialize an empty set to keep track of used numbers.
- For each element in `a`, calculate the MEX of the current set of used numbers.
- Determine the value of `p_i` using the formula `MEX = a_i + p_i`.
- Add `p_i` to the set of used numbers.
- Print the constructed permutation `p`.

Given the issues with the current implementation, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
