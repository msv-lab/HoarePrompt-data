Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap
We need to reconstruct a permutation \( p \) from an array \( a \) where each element \( a_i \) is defined as:
\[ a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \]

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve this problem by iterating through the array \( a \) and constructing the permutation \( p \) based on the given formula.

#### Key Steps in the Program:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `mex` is initialized as an empty list to store the permutation \( p \).
   - `minn` is initialized to 0, representing the current minimum non-negative integer not yet used in \( p \).
   - `maxx` is initialized to 0, representing the maximum value encountered in the `mex` list so far.

2. **Iteration through \( a \):**
   - For each element \( a_i \) in the array \( a \):
     - If \( a_i \) is positive:
       - The program appends `minn` to `mex`.
       - Increments `minn` by 1.
       - If `minn` equals `maxx`, it increments `minn` by 1 again.
     - If \( a_i \) is non-positive:
       - The program appends \( |\text{arr}[i] - \text{minn}| \) to `mex`.
       - If \( |\text{arr}[i] - \text{minn}| \) is greater than `maxx`, it updates `maxx`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed permutation `mex` for each test case.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Handling of Non-Positive \( a_i \):** The program incorrectly calculates the value to append to `mex` when \( a_i \) is non-positive. It should be solving for \( p_i \) such that:
  \[ a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \]
  This implies:
  \[ p_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - a_i \]
  The current implementation does not correctly handle this relationship.
  
- **Updating `maxx`:** The variable `maxx` is not being used correctly. It should track the maximum value in `mex`, but the current logic does not ensure this.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly implement the logic to reconstruct the permutation \( p \) from the array \( a \). The handling of non-positive values in \( a \) and the logic to maintain the MEX value are incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
