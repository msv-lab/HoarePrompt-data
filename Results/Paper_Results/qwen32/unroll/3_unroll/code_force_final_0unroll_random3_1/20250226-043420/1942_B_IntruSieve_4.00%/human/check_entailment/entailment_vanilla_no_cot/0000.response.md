Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly reconstruct the permutation \( p \) from the array \( a \). The logic for determining the MEX and constructing the permutation is flawed. Specifically, the program does not properly handle the case where \( a_i \) is negative and does not correctly ensure that the constructed permutation \( p \) satisfies the given condition \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

Here's a brief explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **MEX Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the MEX by incrementing `minn` whenever it encounters a positive value in `a`. However, this approach does not correctly track the smallest unused non-negative integer in the current prefix of the permutation.

2. **Handling Negative Values**: When `a_i` is negative, the program incorrectly calculates `mex[i]` as `abs(arr[i] - minn)`. This does not align with the requirement that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i`.

3. **Tracking Used Values**: The program does not maintain a set or list of used values to correctly determine the MEX for each position in the permutation.

To fix the program, one should maintain a set of used values and efficiently find the smallest unused non-negative integer (MEX) for each position in the permutation based on the given array `a`. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_mex(used):
    mex = 0
    while mex in used:
        mex += 1
    return mex

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = []
    used = set()
    
    for i in range(n):
        mex_value = find_mex(used)
        p_i = mex_value - arr[i]
        p.append(p_i)
        used.add(p_i)
    
    print(' '.join(map(str, p)))
```

This corrected version maintains a set of used values and calculates the MEX for each position in the permutation, ensuring that the constructed permutation satisfies the given condition.
