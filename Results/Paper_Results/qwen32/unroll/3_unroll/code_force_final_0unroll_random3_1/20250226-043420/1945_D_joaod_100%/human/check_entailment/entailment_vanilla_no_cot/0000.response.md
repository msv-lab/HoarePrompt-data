Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The main issue is how it calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions. The program's logic for calculating the total cost and determining the best cost does not account for the optimal strategy for Kirill to minimize his expenses while reaching his goal.

Here is a brief explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. The program iterates from the end of the queue to the start, but it does not correctly determine the minimum cost for moving Kirill to a position within the first `m` positions.
2. The logic for updating `total` and `best` does not reflect the correct strategy for minimizing the cost. Specifically, it does not consider the impact of passing through multiple people and the cost associated with that.
3. The condition `if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]` is not sufficient to determine the best move, as it does not account for the cumulative cost of passing through multiple people.

A correct solution would involve a more dynamic programming or greedy approach to determine the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions, considering the cost of swapping with each person and the cost of passing through multiple people.
