Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Total Cost**:
   - The code incorrectly calculates the total cost when Kirill swaps positions. It should only add the cost of swapping and passing through people up to the point where Kirill reaches his desired position `m`. However, the current code adds costs in a way that may not lead to the minimum total cost.

2. **Logic for Updating Best Cost**:
   - The variable `best` is intended to keep track of the minimum cost to reach a position within the first `m` people. However, the logic for updating `best` is flawed. The code updates `best` by comparing `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` with `best`, but it does not consider the cost of passing through people correctly.

3. **Handling of Costs**:
   - The code incorrectly adds `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to the total cost even if Kirill has already passed the position `m`. This can lead to an overestimation of the total cost.

Here is a potential counterexample to illustrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
14
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Kirill can swap with the person at position 2 (cost 3) and then pay 4 to pass the person at position 1. This totals to 7, but he can also swap directly with the person at position 1 (cost 7) and then pay 3 to pass the person at position 2. This totals to 10, but the optimal solution is to swap with the person at position 2 (cost 3) and then pay 4 to pass the person at position 1, resulting in a total cost of 7 + 7 = 14.

**Actual Output from the Provided Code:**
- The provided code may not correctly compute this and could result in an incorrect total cost.

Therefore, the code does not handle all cases correctly, and the correctness is **False**.
