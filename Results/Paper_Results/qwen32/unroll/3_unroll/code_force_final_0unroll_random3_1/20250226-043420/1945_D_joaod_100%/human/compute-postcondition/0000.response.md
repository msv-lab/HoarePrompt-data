Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `cases` is an input integer.**

Explanation: `cases` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code.
