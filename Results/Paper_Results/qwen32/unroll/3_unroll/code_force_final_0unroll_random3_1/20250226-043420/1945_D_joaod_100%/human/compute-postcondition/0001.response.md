The only variables in the loop head are `c` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cases`. If `cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `t` does not affect the execution of the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `c` is the loop variable that will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 0**
