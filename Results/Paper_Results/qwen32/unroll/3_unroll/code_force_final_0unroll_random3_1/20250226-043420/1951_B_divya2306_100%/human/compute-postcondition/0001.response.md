The code snippet provided reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. The initial state specifies that `a` is already a list of `n` integers, but this list is being overwritten by the new input values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 2 <= n <= 10^5 and 1 <= k <= n; `a` is a list of n integers read from the input such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 and all a_i are pairwise different. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**

In natural language: The variable `a` is now a list of `n` integers read from the input, where each integer is between 1 and 10^9, and all integers in the list are unique. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
