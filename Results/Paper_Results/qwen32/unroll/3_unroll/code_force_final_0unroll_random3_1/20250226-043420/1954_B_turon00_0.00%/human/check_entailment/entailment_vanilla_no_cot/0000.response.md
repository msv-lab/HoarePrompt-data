Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The goal is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from the array to make it not beautiful. The program checks if all elements are the same and outputs `-1` in that case, which is correct. However, it does not correctly handle arrays that are beautiful but have more than one unique element.

The current implementation attempts to find the minimum consecutive sequence of the first element (`tmp`) and outputs that as the answer, which is not the correct approach. The program should identify the longest sequence of identical elements that can be transformed into a single element through the allowed operation and then calculate the minimum number of removals required to break this sequence.

Here's a more correct approach to solve the problem:

1. Identify the longest sequence of identical elements that can be transformed into a single element.
2. Calculate the minimum number of removals required to break this sequence.

Below is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        if len(set(a)) == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        max_len = 0
        current_len = 1
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i] == a[i - 1]:
                current_len += 1
            else:
                max_len = max(max_len, current_len)
                current_len = 1
        max_len = max(max_len, current_len)
        
        if max_len == 1:
            print(0)
        else:
            print(max_len - 1)

func()
```

This program correctly identifies the longest sequence of identical elements and calculates the minimum number of removals required to break this sequence, ensuring the array is no longer beautiful.
