Let's analyze the given program and the problem requirements step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Understanding:
- An array is considered "beautiful" if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly choosing an index `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1`) such that `a[i - 1] = a[i + 1]` and replacing `a[i]` with `a[i - 1]`.
- We need to find the minimum number of elements to remove from the array to make it stop being beautiful. If it is impossible, we should output `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads `t`, the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the length of the array) and then the array `a`.

2. **Checking for Uniform Array**:
   - It checks if all elements in the array are the same by converting the array to a set and checking if its length is 1.
   - If all elements are the same, it prints `-1` because a uniform array will always remain beautiful regardless of how many elements are removed.

3. **Finding Minimum Removals**:
   - The program initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array and `cnt` to count consecutive elements equal to `tmp`.
   - It iterates through the array:
     - If the current element is equal to `tmp`, it increments `cnt`.
     - If the current element is not equal to `tmp`, it updates `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, then resets `cnt` to 0.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.
   - The final value of `ans` is printed as the result.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program correctly identifies if the array is uniform and outputs `-1` in that case.
- However, the logic for finding the minimum number of removals to make the array non-beautiful is flawed. The program attempts to find the shortest sequence of consecutive elements equal to the first element, but this does not necessarily correspond to the minimum number of removals to make the array non-beautiful.
- The problem requires a more sophisticated approach to determine the minimum removals, which involves analyzing the structure of the array and identifying segments that can be transformed into uniform segments through the allowed operations.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases, especially those where the array is not uniform but can still be made uniform through the allowed operations.

**Correctness: False**
