Reasoning:  
The given program is not correctly solving the problem as described. The task requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array no longer "beautiful." However, the program instead calculates the length of the shortest contiguous subarray that contains all elements equal to the first element of the list and outputs this length unless all elements are the same, in which case it outputs -1. This does not align with the problem's requirements.

The problem specifies that an array is "beautiful" if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\). To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of elements to remove so that no such operation can make all elements the same.

The provided program does not address this requirement. It only checks for contiguous subsequences of the first element and does not consider the broader condition of the array being beautiful.

Therefore, the program's logic is incorrect for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
