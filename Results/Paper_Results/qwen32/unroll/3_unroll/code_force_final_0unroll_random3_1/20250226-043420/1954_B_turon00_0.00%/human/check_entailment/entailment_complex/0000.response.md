Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program calculates the length of the shortest contiguous subarray containing all elements equal to the first element `tmp` of the list `a`. However, the problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful, not finding the shortest contiguous subarray of the first element.

The logic for solving the problem should involve identifying the longest contiguous subarray that can still be made uniform using the allowed operation, and then the minimum number of elements to remove would be the total number of elements minus the length of this longest subarray.

The current implementation does not account for the possibility of different elements forming multiple contiguous subarrays that can be made uniform, nor does it consider the operation that allows the middle element to be replaced if the adjacent elements are the same.

Thus, the program's logic is incorrect for the given problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
