Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful. The logic in the program is flawed and does not handle all cases as required by the problem description.

Let's analyze the code:

1. The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If so, it outputs `-1` because the array cannot stop being beautiful.
2. It then iterates through the array, counting consecutive elements that are the same and keeping track of the minimum count of such consecutive elements.

The key issue is that the program does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. It only considers consecutive elements and their counts, but it does not account for the possibility of removing elements in a way that disrupts the "beautiful" property.

Consider the following test case:
```
3
5
1 2 3 2 1
```
The correct output should be `2` because we can remove the `3` and one of the `2`s, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 2, 1]`, which is not beautiful. However, the program will output `1` because it will find the shortest sequence of consecutive elements, which in this case is `2` or `1` (both of length 2), and will incorrectly return `1`.

Another test case:
```
5
5
1 3 3 3 1
```
The correct output should be `2` because we can remove the `3`s, resulting in the array `[1, 1]`, which is not beautiful. However, the program will output `1` because it will find the shortest sequence of consecutive elements, which is `1` (length 2), and will incorrectly return `1`.

These examples show that the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
