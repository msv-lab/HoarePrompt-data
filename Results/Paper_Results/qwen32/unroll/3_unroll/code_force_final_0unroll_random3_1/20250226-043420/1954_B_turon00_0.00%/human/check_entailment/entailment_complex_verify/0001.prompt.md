You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition.

    #State: For each test case, the output is the length of the shortest contiguous subarray in the list `a` that contains all elements equal to the first element `tmp` of the list. If all elements in the list are the same, the output is -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it determines the length of the shortest contiguous subarray in a list `a` that contains all elements equal to the first element of the list. If all elements in the list are the same, it outputs -1.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the solution is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. A beautiful array can be transformed into an array where all elements are the same through a series of operations where an element can be replaced by its neighbor if the neighbor on both sides is the same.

### Key Points

1. **Beautiful Array**: An array where, through a series of operations, all elements can be made the same.
2. **Operation**: Choose an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) such that `a[i-1] = a[i+1]` and replace `a[i]` with `a[i-1]`.
3. **Objective**: Find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. If it's impossible, return -1.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution follows these steps:

1. **Read Input**: Read the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, read the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
2. **Check Single Element Arrays**: If the array has only one element, it is already non-beautiful, so the answer is `-1`.
3. **Check Uniform Arrays**: If all elements in the array are the same (`len(set(a)) == 1`), it is impossible to make it non-beautiful, so the answer is `-1`.
4. **Count Consecutive Elements**: For arrays with more than one unique element, the solution counts the maximum length of consecutive identical elements. The minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful is the length of the longest sequence of identical elements minus one. This is because removing all but one element from the longest sequence will make the array non-beautiful.

### Correctness Analysis

The solution provided does not correctly address the problem requirements. Here are the issues:

- **Handling Uniform Arrays**: The solution correctly identifies uniform arrays as impossible to make non-beautiful and returns `-1`, which is correct.
- **Handling Non-Uniform Arrays**: The solution incorrectly assumes that removing all but one element from the longest sequence of identical elements will make the array non-beautiful. This is not necessarily true. The problem requires the array to be non-beautiful after operations, not just by removing elements from a sequence.

### Counterexample

Consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`:
- The longest sequence of identical elements is `1` and `2`, each of length 3.
- According to the solution, the answer would be `2` (removing 2 elements from the longest sequence).
- However, removing any one element from this array (e.g., the middle `2`), results in `[1, 2, 1, 1]`, which is still beautiful because you can perform operations to make all elements `1`.

### Conclusion

The provided solution does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It fails to account for the operations allowed and only considers the longest sequence of identical elements.
