In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the integer `n` which is read from the input. The loop head only contains the variable `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not plan to use within the loop body. The loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is the number of test cases.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The state before the loop starts should ensure that `int(input())` returns a value that allows the loop to execute the correct number of times. Since `n` is the number of test cases and it is provided as the first input, the state should reflect that `n` is a positive integer.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is the first integer read from the input.
2. The variable `_` in the loop head does not need to be adjusted because it is not used in the loop body.
3. The state should ensure that the first input is a valid integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5).

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect that `n` is a valid integer input.

State: **The first input `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5**
