The code snippet sets the value of `dp[n - 1][0]` to 0. All other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the number of cards each player receives; `cards` is a list of `n` integers representing the integers on the cards in your hand; `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with all elements initialized to 0, except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is 0.**
