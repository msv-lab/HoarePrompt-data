Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the number of cards each player receives, followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 through `n` appears in the sequence `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` at most 2 times. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 Â· 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of the input integer. The list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` and the conditions provided in the initial state remain unchanged.
