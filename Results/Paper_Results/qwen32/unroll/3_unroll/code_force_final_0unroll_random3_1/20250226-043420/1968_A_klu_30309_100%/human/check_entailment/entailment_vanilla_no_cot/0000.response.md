Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it breaks out of the loop after the first iteration, which means it only checks the largest possible value for `y` (which is `x-1`) and does not explore other potential values of `y` that might yield a higher sum of `\gcd(x, y) + y`. To find the maximum possible sum, the program should iterate through all possible values of `y` from `x-1` down to `1` and update `best_y` whenever a higher sum is found, without breaking out of the loop prematurely.
