The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `results`. This action does not change the values of `t` or `test_cases`. The only change is the creation of the `results` list which is initially empty.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is an empty list.**
