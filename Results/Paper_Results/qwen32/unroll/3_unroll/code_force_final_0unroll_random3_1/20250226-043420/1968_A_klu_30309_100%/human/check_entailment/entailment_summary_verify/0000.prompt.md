You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        best_y = 1
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
                break
        results.append(best_y)
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of integers `test_cases`. It returns a list where each element is the value of each integer `x` in `test_cases` decreased by 1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program contains a logical error that causes it to not find the correct `y` for maximizing the expression `\gcd(x, y) + y`. Specifically, the `break` statement inside the loop causes the loop to exit after the first iteration, which means it only checks the largest possible `y` (which is `x-1`) and does not explore other potential values of `y` that might yield a higher sum.

Here's a specific example to demonstrate the issue:
- For `x = 10`, the program will only check `y = 9` (since the loop starts from `x-1` and decrements `y`).
- The calculation for `y = 9` is `\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10`.
- However, the correct `y` that maximizes the sum is `y = 5`, because `\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10`, but there is another `y = 6` that also maximizes the sum: `\gcd(10, 6) + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8`, but there is `y = 5` that yields `10` which is the maximum.
- The program incorrectly outputs `9` instead of `5` (or any other correct `y` like `5` or `6`).

Therefore, the program does not correctly find the `y` that maximizes the expression for every potential case, making it incorrect.
