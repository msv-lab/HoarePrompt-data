The code snippet provided only reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `m`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `ma`, or `mi`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `m` has been updated to the input value, while all other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each of the t test cases, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' in `s`. `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `m` is an input integer.**
