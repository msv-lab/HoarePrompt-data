The provided code snippet initializes two variables, `ma` and `mi`, both to 0. No other operations are performed that would modify `t`, `n`, or `s`. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each of the t test cases, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' in `s`. `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0.**
