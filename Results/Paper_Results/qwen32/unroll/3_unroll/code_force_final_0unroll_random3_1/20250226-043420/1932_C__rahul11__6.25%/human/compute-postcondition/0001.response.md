The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use. The loop iterates `int(input())` times, so the state that needs to be adjusted is the input that will be provided to the `input()` function.

For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is the number of test cases and it is given that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, we need to ensure that the input provided to `input()` matches this condition.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the first input (which represents `t`) is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the first input to `input()` must be an integer greater than 0**
