You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of integers and handles a series of queries. For each query, it determines a specific segment in the list and outputs the indices of a sub-segment based on certain conditions. The function does not return a value but prints the results of each query directly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for finding a pair of different elements within the specified range of each query is flawed.

The main issues are:
1. The code uses a run-length encoding approach to group consecutive identical elements, but it does not correctly handle queries that span across these groups.
2. The logic for determining whether a valid pair exists within the query range is incorrect. It does not properly check for different elements within the specified range.

Here is an example where the code does not work as expected:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 2 1 1
3
1 2
1 3
2 4
```
**Expected Output:**
```
1 2
1 2
2 4
```
**Actual Output from the Code:**
```
-1 -1
-1 -1
-1 -1
```

In this example, the code fails to find valid pairs for any of the queries. The correct pairs for the queries are:
- For query (1, 2): The elements are 1 and 2, which are different.
- For query (1, 3): The elements are 1, 2, and 2. The valid pair is (1, 2) or (1, 3).
- For query (2, 4): The elements are 2, 2, and 1. The valid pair is (2, 4).

The code does not correctly identify these pairs and instead returns `-1 -1` for all queries, indicating no valid pairs were found. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
