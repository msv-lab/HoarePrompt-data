Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for finding a pair of different elements within the specified range of each query is flawed.

The main issues are:
1. The code uses a run-length encoding approach to group consecutive identical elements, but it does not correctly handle queries that span across these groups.
2. The logic for determining whether a valid pair exists within the query range is incorrect. It does not properly check for different elements within the specified range.

Here is an example where the code does not work as expected:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 2 1 1
3
1 2
1 3
2 4
```
**Expected Output:**
```
1 2
1 2
2 4
```
**Actual Output from the Code:**
```
-1 -1
-1 -1
-1 -1
```

In this example, the code fails to find valid pairs for any of the queries. The correct pairs for the queries are:
- For query (1, 2): The elements are 1 and 2, which are different.
- For query (1, 3): The elements are 1, 2, and 2. The valid pair is (1, 2) or (1, 3).
- For query (2, 4): The elements are 2, 2, and 1. The valid pair is (2, 4).

The code does not correctly identify these pairs and instead returns `-1 -1` for all queries, indicating no valid pairs were found. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
