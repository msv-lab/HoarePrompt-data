You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
import os
import string

def func():
    os.system('cls')
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                (ans, x) = ('AAA', 1)
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it constructs a string of length `n` using uppercase letters from the alphabet, ensuring that the string is composed of pairs of the same letter, and prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's go through the problem and the given program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to generate a string of uppercase Latin letters that contains exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. For example, in the string "AAABAACC", the special characters are at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and attempts to generate a string with exactly `n` special characters.

Here's a breakdown of the logic in the program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `s` is set to a string of all uppercase Latin letters.
   - `t` is the number of test cases.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the program reads an integer `n`.
   - If `n == 1`, the program outputs "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly one special character in a string of uppercase Latin letters (a special character must have a neighbor, and the only way to have a single special character is if it has exactly one neighbor, which is not possible in a string of unique characters).
   - If `n > 1`, the program attempts to construct a string:
     - If `n` is even, it constructs a string by repeating each of the first `n // 2` letters twice.
     - If `n` is odd, it starts with "AAA" and then repeats each of the next `n // 2 - 1` letters twice.

### Correctness Check

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1: `n = 6`**
   - The program constructs the string "AAABAACC".
   - The special characters are at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8, which is correct.

2. **Example 2: `n = 1`**
   - The program outputs "NO", which is correct because it's impossible to have exactly one special character.

3. **Example 3: `n = 2`**
   - The program constructs the string "AA".
   - The special characters are at positions 1 and 2, which is correct.

However, there is a flaw in the logic for odd `n`. The program starts with "AAA" and then repeats each of the next `n // 2 - 1` letters twice. This does not guarantee that there will be exactly `n` special characters. For example, if `n = 3`, the program will output "AAA", which has 4 special characters (positions 1, 2, 3, and 4), not 3.

### Conclusion

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when `n` is odd. The logic for constructing the string when `n` is odd needs to be revised to ensure that there are exactly `n` special characters.

Correctness: **False**
