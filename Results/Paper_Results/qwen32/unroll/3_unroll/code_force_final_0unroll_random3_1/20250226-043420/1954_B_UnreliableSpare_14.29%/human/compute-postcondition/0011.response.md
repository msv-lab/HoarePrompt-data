The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs `-1`. The initial state provides information about various variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `flag`, `ans`, `val`, `cnt`), but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of these variables and directly outputs `-1`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print(-1)`.
2. The value to be printed is `-1`.
3. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `flag`, `ans`, `val`, and `cnt` are defined in the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement.
4. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `-1`.

Output: **-1**
