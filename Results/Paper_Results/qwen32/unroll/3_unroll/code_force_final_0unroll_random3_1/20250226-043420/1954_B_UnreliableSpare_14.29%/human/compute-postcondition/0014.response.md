Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input; `flag` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in `arr` are the same; `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`; `val` is the last encountered value in `arr` that started a sequence counted by `cnt`; `cnt` is the count of the final sequence of elements in `arr` that are equal to the last encountered `val`.**
