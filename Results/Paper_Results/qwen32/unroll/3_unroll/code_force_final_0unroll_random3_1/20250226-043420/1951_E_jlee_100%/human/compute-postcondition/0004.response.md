Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a string of lowercase Latin characters. For each string, it determines if it is possible to make the string non-palindromic by removing at most two characters. If it is possible, the function outputs 'YES' followed by the number of characters removed (either 1 or 2) and the resulting string(s). If it is not possible, the function outputs 'NO'.**
