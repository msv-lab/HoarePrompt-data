You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
One of the days of the hike coincided with a holiday, so in the evening at the
camp, it was decided to arrange a festive fireworks display. For this purpose,
the organizers of the hike bought two installations for launching fireworks
and a huge number of shells for launching.

Both installations are turned on simultaneously. The first installation
launches fireworks every a minutes (i.e., after a, 2 \cdot a, 3 \cdot a, \dots
minutes after launch). The second installation launches fireworks every b
minutes (i.e., after b, 2 \cdot b, 3 \cdot b, \dots minutes after launch).

Each firework is visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a
firework was launched after x minutes after the installations were turned on,
it will be visible every minute from x to x + m , inclusive. If one firework
was launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one
minute.

What is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the
same time?

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow the
descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains integers a , b , m (1 \le
a, b, m \le 10^{18} ) — the frequency of launching for the first installation,
the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky.

Output

For each set of input data, output a single number — the maximum number of
fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

Note

In the first set of input data, the fireworks are visible in the sky for 5
minutes. Since the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and
the second one every 7 minutes, two fireworks launched from the same
installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time. At the same
time, after 7 minutes from the start of the holiday, one firework from the
first and one from the second camp will be visible. Thus, it is possible to
see no more than 2 fireworks simultaneously.

In the third set of input data, 17 fireworks will be visible after 112
minutes:

  * 9 fireworks launched from the first installation at times [56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112 ]; 
  * 8 fireworks launched from the second installation at times [56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112 ].

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if m < a and m < b:
            print(2)
        elif m < a and m > b:
            print(2 + m // b)
        elif m < b and m > a:
            print(2 + m // a)
        else:
            print(m // a + m // b + 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. It then calculates and prints a value based on the conditions involving `a`, `b`, and `m`. Specifically, it prints `2` if both `a` and `b` are greater than `m`. If only `b` is greater than `m`, it prints `2 + m // b`. If only `a` is greater than `m`, it prints `2 + m // a`. Otherwise, it prints `m // a + m // b + 2`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the logic of the provided program and compare it with the problem description.

The program is intended to calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time, given the launch frequencies `a` and `b`, and the visibility duration `m`.

Here's the breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`.

2. **Decision Making Based on Conditions**:
   - If `m < a` and `m < b`, the program outputs `2`. This suggests that if the visibility duration `m` is less than both launch frequencies, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is `2`. This is plausible because the first fireworks from each installation will be visible at different times and won't overlap.
   - If `m < a` and `m > b`, the program outputs `2 + m // b`. This suggests that if the visibility duration `m` is less than the launch frequency `a` but greater than the launch frequency `b`, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is `2` (one from each installation) plus the number of fireworks launched by the second installation during the visibility duration of the first firework.
   - If `m < b` and `m > a`, the program outputs `2 + m // a`. This is similar to the previous condition but reversed for the launch frequencies `a` and `b`.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met (i.e., `m >= a` and `m >= b`), the program outputs `m // a + m // b + 2`. This suggests that the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time includes fireworks launched by both installations during the visibility duration of the first firework, plus one for each installation.

However, the provided logic does not correctly account for the overlap of fireworks' visibility periods. The correct approach involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and then calculating the number of fireworks within a period of `m + 1` minutes from the start of the display, considering overlaps.

The current logic does not handle the overlap correctly and simplifies the problem in a way that does not align with the problem's requirements.

**Example Analysis**:

- For the input `6 7 4`, the correct output should be `2` because fireworks from each installation do not overlap in visibility.
- For the input `3 4 10`, the correct output should be `7` because within a period of `11` minutes (from `0` to `10`), the fireworks launched at `0, 3, 6, 9` from the first installation and `0, 4, 8` from the second installation result in a maximum of `7` fireworks visible at the same time.

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum number of overlapping fireworks.

**Conclusion**:
The logic in the program is incorrect because it does not accurately account for the visibility overlap of fireworks.
