The only objects in the loop head are `suit` and `rank`, which are derived from the items of the dictionary `suits`. For the loop to execute, the dictionary `suits` must have at least one key-value pair. The initial state of `suits` should be such that it contains at least one suit with either `None` or a rank of an unpaired non-trump card.

Hereâ€™s the adjusted state:

State: **`trumps` is a list of ranks of trump cards, `answers` is a list of sorted pairs of non-trump cards of the same suit, `suits` is a dictionary with at least one suit having either None or the rank of an unpaired non-trump card, `suit` is the first suit in the dictionary, `rank` is the rank associated with the first suit in the dictionary**
