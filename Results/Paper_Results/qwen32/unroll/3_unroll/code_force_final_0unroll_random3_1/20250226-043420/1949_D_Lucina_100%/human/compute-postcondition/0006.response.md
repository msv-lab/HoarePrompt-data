The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `sa`. This action does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, or `xx`. Therefore, the only change in the state is the creation of the `sa` list.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the count of 'F's involving the `i`-th position, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[0]` is 0 and `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the count of 'S's involving the `i`-th position, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, the first being `''` and the rest being the input strings, `sa` is an empty list.**
