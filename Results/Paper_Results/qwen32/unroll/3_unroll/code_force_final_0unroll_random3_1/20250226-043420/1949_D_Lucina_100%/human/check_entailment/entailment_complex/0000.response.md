### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by first counting the number of 'F' and 'S' transitions for each scenario (node). It then categorizes scenarios into two lists, `sa` and `sb`, based on whether they have 'F's but no 'S's or 'S's but no 'F's, respectively. If there are more scenarios in `sa` than `sb`, the code assigns 'F' to undecided transitions involving scenarios in `sa` and 'S' to the rest. Conversely, if there are more scenarios in `sb`, it assigns 'S' to undecided transitions involving scenarios in `sb` and 'F' to the rest.

However, there are a few issues with this approach:

1. **Handling of Undecided Scenarios**: The code only fills in '?' with 'F' or 'S' based on the initial counts of 'F's and 'S's. It does not ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type will be seen for any permutation of scenarios. This is a critical requirement of the problem.
   
2. **Logic for Assigning 'F' and 'S'**: The logic for assigning 'F' and 'S' to '?' is flawed. The conditions `i in sa[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sa[:n // 4 - 1]` are not sufficient to ensure the required constraint. The code does not take into account the actual sequence of transitions and their types.

3. **General Approach**: The approach taken by the code does not guarantee that the solution will work for all possible permutations of scenarios. It fails to consider the requirement that no matter the order of scenarios, the number of consecutive videos of the same type should not exceed \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\).

### Conclusion:

Given the above points, the code does not correctly address the problem requirements. Therefore, it is not guaranteed to produce a valid solution for all inputs.

Correctness: **False**
