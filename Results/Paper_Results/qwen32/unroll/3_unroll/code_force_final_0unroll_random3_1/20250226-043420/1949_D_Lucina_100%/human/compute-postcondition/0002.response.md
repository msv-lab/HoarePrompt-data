The code snippet creates a new list `b` with `n + 1` elements, all initialized to 0. The value of `n` and the initial state of `a` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, and `n` is assigned the value of the input integer; The input consists of n lines, each containing n characters where each character is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', representing the transition video type between scenarios i and j; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `b` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
