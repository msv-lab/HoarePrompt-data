### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by counting the number of 'F' and 'S' in each row and then making decisions based on those counts to fill in the '?' characters. However, the logic used in the program is flawed and does not guarantee that the solution will meet the requirement of not having more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type in any permutation of scenarios.

Here are the main issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Logic for '?' Replacement:**
   - The program uses a heuristic that assigns 'F' or 'S' to '?' based on whether the row/column index is in the first \(\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \rfloor - 1\) elements of the list `sa` or `sb`. This heuristic does not ensure that the resulting sequence of videos will meet the requirement of not having more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.
   - The logic does not consider the overall sequence of videos for all possible permutations of scenarios, which is crucial for ensuring the solution meets the problem constraints.

2. **Lack of Comprehensive Checking:**
   - The program does not verify that the generated matrix satisfies the condition for any permutation of scenarios. It only fills in '?' characters based on a simple heuristic without checking the validity of the entire solution.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases effectively. For example, if the number of 'F's and 'S's in each row/column is already close to the limit, the heuristic used may not work correctly.

### Correctness:

Given the above issues, the program does not guarantee that the solution will meet the problem's requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
