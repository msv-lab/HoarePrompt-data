To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's analyze the loop's behavior step-by-step.

Given:
- `a` and `b` are lists that keep track of counts of 'F's and 'S's respectively, but they are not modified in the loop.
- `xx` is a list of strings, where `xx[0]` is `''` and the rest are input strings.
- `sa` and `sb` are lists of indices, but they are not modified in the loop.
- The loop iterates over each string in `xx` (from index 1 to `n`).
- For each character in the string, if it's not a '?', it is added to the new string `nx`. If it is a '?', the decision depends on whether the current index `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`.
- The new string `nx` is printed in each iteration.

Let's assume `n` is 8 for simplicity, and `sb` contains indices `[2, 3, 5, 7]` (just an example). The first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb` would be `[2, 3]` (since `8 // 4 - 1 = 1`).

For each string in `xx` (from index 1 to 8):
- If a character at position `j` is not a '?', it is directly added to `nx`.
- If a character at position `j` is a '?', and either `i` or `j` is in `[2, 3]`, 'S' is added to `nx`. Otherwise, 'F' is added.

Let's assume `xx` is `['', '???F?', 'S?F?S', '???S?', '?F?F?', '?S?S?', '???F?', '?S?F?']`.

Here's how the loop would process each string:

1. For `xx[1] = '???F?'`:
   - `nx` becomes `'SSFSS'` (since `i=1` is not in `[2, 3]` and `j=4` is not in `[2, 3]`).

2. For `xx[2] = 'S?F?S'`:
   - `nx` becomes `'SFFFF'` (since `i=2` is in `[2, 3]`).

3. For `xx[3] = '???S?'`:
   - `nx` becomes `'SSFSS'` (since `i=3` is in `[2, 3]`).

4. For `xx[4] = '?F?F?'`:
   - `nx` becomes `'FFFFF'` (since `i=4` is not in `[2, 3]`).

5. For `xx[5] = '?S?S?'`:
   - `nx` becomes `'FFFFF'` (since `i=5` is not in `[2, 3]`).

6. For `xx[6] = '???F?'`:
   - `nx` becomes `'FFFFF'` (since `i=6` is not in `[2, 3]`).

7. For `xx[7] = '?S?F?'`:
   - `nx` becomes `'FFFFF'` (since `i=7` is not in `[2, 3]`).

8. For `xx[8] = '?S?F?'`:
   - `nx` becomes `'FFFFF'` (since `i=8` is not in `[2, 3]`).

The `xx` list will be modified in place during the loop, but since the problem asks for the output state after the loop finishes, we focus on the printed strings.

Output State: **xx = ['', 'SSFSS', 'SFFFF', 'SSFSS', 'FFFFF', 'FFFFF', 'FFFFF', 'FFFFF']**.
