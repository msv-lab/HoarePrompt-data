n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. The input consists of n lines, each containing n characters. The j-th character of the i-th line is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', representing the transition video type between scenarios i and j, where '?' indicates an undecided video, 'F' indicates a funny video, 'S' indicates a scary video, and '.' indicates i=j. The input guarantees that the i-th character of the j-th line is the same as the j-th character of the i-th line for all i and j, and that at most floor(n/2) transition videos are already decided.
