To determine the output state, we need to understand the contents of `output1` and `output2`:

- `output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, in reverse order.
- `output2` contains the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`.

When we concatenate `output2` and `output1`, we get a list of all divisors of `x` in ascending order.

Output State: **The program returns a list of all divisors of `x` in ascending order.**
