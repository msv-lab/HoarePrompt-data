### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine how many valid values of \( k \) exist such that Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received \( x \) fit the described settling pattern.

The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions. The key is to find all possible \( k \) values that fit the conditions:

1. The position \( n \) can be expressed in terms of the cycle length \( 2k - 2 \) and the number \( x \).
2. The number \( x \) must be within the range of numbers assigned in the cycle (i.e., \( 1 \leq x \leq k \) or \( 1 \leq x \leq k-1 \) depending on the segment of the pattern).

The program uses two conditions to determine potential \( k \) values:

1. \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \)
2. \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \)

For each condition, the program calculates a potential cycle length \( s \) and checks if it can be expressed as \( 2k - 2 \) for some \( k \) such that \( k \geq x \).

The function `func_1(x)` computes all divisors of \( x \). This is used to find potential cycle lengths \( s \) that divide \( n + x - 2 \) or \( n - x \).

The program then checks if \( (s + 2) / 2 \) is a valid \( k \) (i.e., \( (s + 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (s + 2) / 2 \geq x \)).

Finally, it removes duplicates from the list of valid \( k \) values and outputs the count.

### Correctness:

The logic of the program seems correct based on the problem description. It properly checks the conditions and finds all possible \( k \) values that fit the given constraints. The function `func_1(x)` correctly computes all divisors of \( x \), which is essential for determining the potential cycle lengths.

Therefore, the program appears to be correctly solving the problem.

Correctness: **True**
