Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described.

1. **Undefined Function**: The function `func_1` is used but not defined in the provided code. This means the code will throw a `NameError` when executed.

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic for determining valid `k` values is not correctly implemented. The program attempts to find divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x` but does not properly check if these divisors correspond to valid `k` values as per the problem description.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, it does not check if `k` is greater than 1, which is a requirement according to the problem description.

4. **Output Handling**: The program calculates potential `k` values but does not print them as required. It appends valid `k` values to the `output` list but does not print the length of this list for each test case.

Here is an example case where the program does not work as expected:

**Input:**
```
1
10 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
For `n = 10` and `x = 2`, the valid `k` values are 2, 3, 5, and 6. The program should output `4` but due to the issues mentioned above, it does not produce the correct result.

To correct the program, the following changes need to be made:
- Define the `func_1` function to find divisors.
- Correct the logic to determine valid `k` values.
- Ensure that the program prints the number of valid `k` values for each test case.
- Add checks to ensure `k > 1`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_divisors(x):
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != x // i:
                divisors.append(x // i)
    return divisors

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    valid_ks = set()
    
    # Check divisors of (n + x - 2)
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        divisors = find_divisors((n + x - 2) // 2)
        for d in divisors:
            if d >= x:
                valid_ks.add(d + 1)
    
    # Check divisors of (n - x)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        divisors = find_divisors((n - x) // 2)
        for d in divisors:
            if d >= x:
                valid_ks.add(d + 1)
    
    # Filter out k <= 1
    valid_ks = {k for k in valid_ks if k > 1}
    
    print(len(valid_ks))
```

This corrected version should handle all edge cases and produce the correct output for each test case.
