The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range it iterates over, which is determined by `x`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the range `(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1)` is valid and contains at least one integer. 

The range `(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1)` will contain at least one integer if `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` is greater than 1, which simplifies to `int(x ** 0.5)` being at least 1. This condition is always true for any `x` that is greater than or equal to 1, as given in the problem statement (`1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`).

Since the loop condition is already satisfied by the given constraints on `x`, no adjustments to `x` or `i` are necessary for the loop to execute. The variables `n`, `output1`, and `output2` do not affect the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `output1` is an empty list; `output2` is an empty list**
