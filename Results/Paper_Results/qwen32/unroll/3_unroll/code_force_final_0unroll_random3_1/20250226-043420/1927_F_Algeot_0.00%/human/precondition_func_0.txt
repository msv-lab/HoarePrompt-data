The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains two integers n (3 ≤ n ≤ m) and m (m ≤ min(n*(n - 1)/2, 2 * 10^5)) representing the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively. The following m lines each contain three integers u, v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v) and w (1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6) representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w. There is at most one edge between each pair of vertices, and the graph does not contain loops or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices. The sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one simple cycle in the graph.
