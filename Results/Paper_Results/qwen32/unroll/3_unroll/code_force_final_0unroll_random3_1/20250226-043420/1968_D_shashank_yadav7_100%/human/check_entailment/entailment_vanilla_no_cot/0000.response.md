Correctness: **False**

The given program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores**: The program incorrectly calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. The scores should be accumulated over the `k` turns, but the current implementation does not correctly update the scores as the players move through the permutation.

2. **Incorrect Loop Condition**: The loop runs `n` times, which is not necessary. It should run `k` times, as the game lasts for `k` turns.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Moves**: The program does not correctly simulate the moves of Bodya and Sasha. Specifically, it should consider the maximum possible score Bodya and Sasha can achieve by either staying at their current position or moving to the position indicated by the permutation.

4. **Initialization of Scores**: The initial scores are set to `a[b]` and `a[s]`, but this is not sufficient. The scores should be accumulated over the `k` turns.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        bp = 0
        sp = 0
        visited_b = [False] * n
        visited_s = [False] * n
        cycle_b = []
        cycle_s = []
        cycle_b_score = 0
        cycle_s_score = 0
        
        # Calculate Bodya's score
        for _ in range(k):
            bp += a[b]
            if visited_b[b]:
                break
            visited_b[b] = True
            cycle_b.append(b)
            cycle_b_score += a[b]
            b = p[b] - 1
        
        # Calculate Sasha's score
        for _ in range(k):
            sp += a[s]
            if visited_s[s]:
                break
            visited_s[s] = True
            cycle_s.append(s)
            cycle_s_score += a[s]
            s = p[s] - 1
        
        # Handle cycles for Bodya
        if len(cycle_b) < k:
            remaining_turns = k - len(cycle_b)
            full_cycles = remaining_turns // len(cycle_b)
            bp += full_cycles * cycle_b_score
            remaining_turns %= len(cycle_b)
            for _ in range(remaining_turns):
                bp += a[cycle_b.pop(0)]
        
        # Handle cycles for Sasha
        if len(cycle_s) < k:
            remaining_turns = k - len(cycle_s)
            full_cycles = remaining_turns // len(cycle_s)
            sp += full_cycles * cycle_s_score
            remaining_turns %= len(cycle_s)
            for _ in range(remaining_turns):
                sp += a[cycle_s.pop(0)]
        
        if bp > sp:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bp < sp:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

This corrected program properly handles the game logic, including cycles in the permutation, and correctly accumulates the scores over the `k` turns.
