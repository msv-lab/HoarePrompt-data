You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9.

            print(k)
        
    #State: `i` is equal to `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the values from the last test case, and `k` is the value calculated for the last test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it does not properly account for the conditions under which it should return -1. Let's analyze the code:

1. The code checks if `b % 3 != 0 and c < 3` and `(b + c) % 3 != 0`. If both conditions are true, it prints `-1`. This is incorrect because it does not cover all cases where it should return -1.

2. For example, consider a case where `a = 0`, `b = 1`, and `c = 0`. Here, there is one extrovert who needs to be in a tent with two others, but there are no universals available to form a group of three. The code does not handle this case correctly and would incorrectly calculate the number of tents instead of returning `-1`.

3. Another example: `a = 0`, `b = 2`, `c = 1`. Here, two extroverts need to be in a tent with two others, but there is only one universal, which means one extrovert will be left without a tent. The code does not handle this case correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the code that properly handles all edge cases:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        k = 0
        # Start by accommodating introverts
        k += a
        # Try to accommodate extroverts with universals
        pairs_needed = b
        # Use universals to form pairs with extroverts
        pairs_from_universals = min(c // 2, pairs_needed)
        pairs_needed -= pairs_from_universals
        c -= pairs_from_universals * 2
        # If still pairs needed, check if remaining universals can form a pair
        if pairs_needed > 0:
            if c >= 2:
                pairs_from_remaining_universals = c // 3
                pairs_needed -= pairs_from_remaining_universals
                c -= pairs_from_remaining_universals * 3
        # If still pairs needed, it's impossible
        if pairs_needed > 0:
            print(-1)
        else:
            k += (b + c) // 3
            if (b + c) % 3 != 0:
                k += 1
            print(k)

func()
```

This corrected code ensures that all conditions are properly checked and handles the edge cases correctly.
