### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix by performing at most \( 2n \) operations. Each operation involves filling a row or a column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \). The sum of the numbers in any permutation of 1 to \( n \) is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).

#### Key Observations

1. **Maximizing the Sum:**
   - To maximize the sum, we should fill as many rows and columns as possible with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

2. **Operations:**
   - Type 1: Fill a row with a permutation.
   - Type 2: Fill a column with a permutation.

3. **Strategy:**
   - We can fill all \( n \) rows with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) using \( n \) Type 1 operations.
   - If there are still remaining cells to fill, we can use Type 2 operations to fill columns with the same permutation. However, since we can fill all rows already, we only need \( n \) operations in total.

#### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to construct the operations as follows:

1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the sum incorrectly by checking if the row number \( i \) is less than \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
   - The correct approach is to simply add \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) for each of the \( n \) rows.

2. **Operation Construction:**
   - The program prints \( n + r \) operations, where \( r \) is determined during the sum calculation.
   - The variable \( r \) is not correctly calculated to determine the number of operations.
   - The program should only need \( n \) operations to fill all rows.

#### Issues in the Program

1. **Sum Calculation Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating the sum is incorrect. The sum of a permutation is always \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), and it should be added for each row filled.
   - The condition `if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n:` does not make sense in this context.

2. **Operation Counting:**
   - The variable \( r \) is not correctly calculated to determine the number of operations.
   - The program does not ensure that the total number of operations is at most \( 2n \).

3. **Output:**
   - The output format and logic for constructing operations are incorrect.

#### Correctness

Given the issues identified in the program, it does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix or ensure that the number of operations is at most \( 2n \).

#### Conclusion

The original assessment is correct in identifying the issues with the program. The program does not correctly calculate the sum or construct the operations as required by the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
