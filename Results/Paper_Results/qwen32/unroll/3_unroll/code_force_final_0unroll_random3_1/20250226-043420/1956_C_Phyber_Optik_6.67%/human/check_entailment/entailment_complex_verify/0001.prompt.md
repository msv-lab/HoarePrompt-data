You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

    #State: `sum` and `r` will be in their final state after the last test case, and the output will consist of the print statements for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by an integer `n` representing the size of an `n x n` matrix. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific sum and a sequence of operations involving the matrix size. The sum is derived based on a conditional logic related to the matrix size, and the sequence of operations involves printing indices and ranges up to `n + r`, where `r` is determined during the calculation. The function outputs the calculated sum and the sequence of operations for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix by performing at most \( 2n \) operations. The operations involve filling rows or columns with permutations of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

### Key Observations

1. **Maximizing the Sum:**
   - The sum of the numbers in a permutation of 1 to \( n \) is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
   - To maximize the sum of the matrix, we should aim to have the highest possible numbers in as many cells as possible.

2. **Operations:**
   - Type 1: Fill a row with a permutation.
   - Type 2: Fill a column with a permutation.

3. **Strategy:**
   - It's beneficial to fill as many rows as possible with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) because it contains the highest possible sum of \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
   - If there are still remaining cells to fill, we can use Type 2 operations to fill columns with the same permutation.

### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to construct the operations as follows:

1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - For each row, it calculates the sum contribution by checking if the row number \( i \) is less than \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
   - If true, it adds the sum of the permutation \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) to the total sum.
   - Otherwise, it adds \( i \times n \) to the total sum.

2. **Operation Construction:**
   - It prints \( n + r \) operations, where \( r \) is determined during the sum calculation.
   - For the first \( n \) operations, it fills rows with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - For the remaining \( r \) operations, it fills columns with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

### Issues in the Program

1. **Sum Calculation Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating the sum is incorrect. The sum of a permutation is always \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), and it should be added for each row filled.
   - The condition `if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n:` does not make sense in this context.

2. **Operation Counting:**
   - The variable \( r \) is not correctly calculated to determine the number of operations.
   - The program does not ensure that the total number of operations is at most \( 2n \).

3. **Output:**
   - The output format and logic for constructing operations are incorrect.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified in the program, it does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix or ensure that the number of operations is at most \( 2n \).

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
