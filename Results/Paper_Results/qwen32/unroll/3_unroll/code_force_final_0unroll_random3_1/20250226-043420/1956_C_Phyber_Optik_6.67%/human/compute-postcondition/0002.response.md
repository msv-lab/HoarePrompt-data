To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to analyze the given code snippet. The code runs for `t` test cases, and for each test case, it performs a series of operations based on the input value `n`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what happens in each iteration:

1. **Initialization**: `sum` and `r` are initialized to 0.
2. **First Loop (Inner Loop)**:
    - It runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
    - For each `i`, it checks if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
        - If true, it sets `r` to `i` and adds `n * (n + 1) // 2` to `sum`.
        - If false, it adds `i * n` to `sum`.
3. **Print Statement**: After the inner loop, it prints `sum` and `n + r`.
4. **Second Loop (Printing)**:
    - It runs from `j = 1` to `j = n + r`.
    - For each `j`, it prints a line:
        - If `j <= n`, it prints `1, j, 1 2 3 ... n`.
        - If `j > n`, it prints `2, j % n, 1 2 3 ... n`.

Given the nature of the loop, the variables `sum` and `r` are recalculated for each test case, and the print statements output the results based on the current test case's value of `n`.

Since the variables `sum` and `r` are recalculated for each test case and are not preserved across test cases, the final state of these variables after all test cases are executed will be the state they are in after the last test case. However, the overall output will be a series of print statements for each test case, and the variables `sum` and `r` will be in their final state after the last test case.

To summarize, the output state after the loop executes all iterations will be the state of the variables after the last test case. Since the output is a series of print statements, the final state of `sum` and `r` after the last test case will be:

Output State: **`sum` and `r` will be in their final state after the last test case, and the output will consist of the print statements for each test case.**
