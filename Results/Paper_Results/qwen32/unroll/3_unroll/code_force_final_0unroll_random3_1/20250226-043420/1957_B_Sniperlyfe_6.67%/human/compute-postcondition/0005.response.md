Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of elements in the list to be returned and `k` is an integer. The function returns a list `nums` of length `n` such that the first `n-1` elements are the largest possible value with the same number of bits as `k` (i.e., `2^b - 1`), and the last element is this value plus `k`.**
