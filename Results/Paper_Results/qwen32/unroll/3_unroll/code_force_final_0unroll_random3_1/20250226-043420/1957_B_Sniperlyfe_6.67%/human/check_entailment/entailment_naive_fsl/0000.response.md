Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Let's analyze why:

The current implementation of `func_1` initializes all elements of the sequence to a value derived from the highest bit of `k` and then adjusts the last element to ensure the sum equals `k`. This does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR.

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
3 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 2 2
```
or any other sequence that sums to 5 and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR. For example, `1 2 2` results in `1 | 2 | 2 = 3` which is `11` in binary, having 2 ones. Another valid output could be `1 4 0` which results in `1 | 4 | 0 = 5` which is `101` in binary, having 2 ones. However, `3 1 1` results in `3 | 1 | 1 = 3` which is `11` in binary, having 2 ones. But `1 2 2` or `1 4 0` are better because they use the bits more efficiently.

**Actual Output from the Code:**
```
3 3 -1
```
or some other incorrect sequence because the current code logic does not ensure that the sequence sums to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR.

To maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR, we should distribute the bits of `k` across the sequence in a way that maximizes the number of unique bits set to 1. The current implementation does not achieve this.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
