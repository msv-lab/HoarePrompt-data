### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to generate a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR.

The function `func_1` is supposed to:
1. Generate `n` numbers.
2. Each of the first `n-1` numbers should be the largest number with the same number of bits as the initial `k` (i.e., `2^b - 1` where `b` is the bit length of `k`).
3. The last number should be adjusted to ensure the sum of all numbers equals `k`.

However, there are a few issues with the provided function:
- The first `n-1` numbers are set to the largest number with the same number of bits as `k`, which is not necessarily the best strategy to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.
- The strategy does not consider the optimal distribution of values to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR.

Let's consider the example `n = 2` and `k = 5`:
- The provided function would set the first number to `2^3 - 1 = 7` (since `k` has 3 bits), and then the second number to `5 - 7 = -2`, which is invalid.
- The correct approach would be to set the first number to `1` (binary `01`), the second number to `4` (binary `100`), resulting in `1 | 4 = 5` (binary `101`), which has 2 ones.

The current function does not guarantee that the numbers will be non-negative or that the bitwise OR will be maximized.
