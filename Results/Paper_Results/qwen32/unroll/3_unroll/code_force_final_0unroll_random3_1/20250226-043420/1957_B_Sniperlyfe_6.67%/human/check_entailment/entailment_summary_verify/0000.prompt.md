You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        k -= nums[i]
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of elements in the list to be returned and `k` is an integer. It returns a list `nums` of length `n` such that the first `n-1` elements are the largest possible value with the same number of bits as the initial `k` (i.e., `2^b - 1`), and the last element is this value plus the remaining `k` after reducing `k` by the sum of the first `n-1` elements.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Let's analyze why:

The current implementation of `func_1` initializes all elements of the sequence to a value derived from the highest bit of `k` and then adjusts the last element to ensure the sum equals `k`. This does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR.

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
3 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 2 2
```
or any other sequence that sums to 5 and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR. For example, `1 2 2` results in `1 | 2 | 2 = 3` which is `11` in binary, having 2 ones. Another valid output could be `1 4 0` which results in `1 | 4 | 0 = 5` which is `101` in binary, having 2 ones. However, `3 1 1` results in `3 | 1 | 1 = 3` which is `11` in binary, having 2 ones. But `1 2 2` or `1 4 0` are better because they use the bits more efficiently.

**Actual Output from the Code:**
```
3 3 -1
```
or some other incorrect sequence because the current code logic does not ensure that the sequence sums to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR.

To maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR, we should distribute the bits of `k` across the sequence in a way that maximizes the number of unique bits set to 1. The current implementation does not achieve this.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
