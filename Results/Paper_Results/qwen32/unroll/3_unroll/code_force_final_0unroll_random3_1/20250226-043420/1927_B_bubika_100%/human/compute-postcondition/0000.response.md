The code snippet provided assigns a string of all lowercase Latin letters to the variable `a`. This means `a` is no longer a list of integers but a string containing the alphabet from 'a' to 'z'. The other variables `t`, `n`, and the initial list `a` of integers are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; the initial list `a` of n integers where 0 <= a_i < n is not changed; `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**.
