Precondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, v is a list of n integers where each integer v_i satisfies 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9, and p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
