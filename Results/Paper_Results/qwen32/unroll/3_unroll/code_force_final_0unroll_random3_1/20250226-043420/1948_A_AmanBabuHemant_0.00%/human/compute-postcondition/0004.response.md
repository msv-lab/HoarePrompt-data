Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even, it constructs a string consisting of '110' repeated `n // 2` times and prints 'YES' followed by the string if the string's length is less than 200; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**
