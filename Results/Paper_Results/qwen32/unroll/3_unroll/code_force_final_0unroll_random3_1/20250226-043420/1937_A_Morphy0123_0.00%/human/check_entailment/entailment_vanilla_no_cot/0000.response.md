Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the position of 1 after performing the specified swap operations for each test case. The logic implemented in the program is incorrect for finding the position of 1 in the resulting array.

The key observation for solving this problem is that the position of 1 in the array after all the swap operations is the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to n. This can be directly determined using the `log2` function and appropriate rounding, but the current implementation has errors in this logic.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import log2, floor

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            # Find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to n
            power = floor(log2(n))
            print(2 ** power)

func()
```

This corrected version uses `floor(log2(n))` to determine the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n` and then prints `2 ** power` as the result. This matches the expected behavior based on the problem description.
