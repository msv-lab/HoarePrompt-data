The code provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The initial state mentions that there are `t` test cases, but `t` itself is not defined. After executing the code, `t` is defined with the input value.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains three integers a, b, and m (1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18) representing the frequency of launching fireworks for the first and second installations, and the visibility duration of each firework, respectively.**
