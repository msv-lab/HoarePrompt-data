The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the sum of two values `A` and `B`, where `A` is the number of times fireworks from the first installation are visible within the duration `m` plus one, and `B` is the number of times fireworks from the second installation are visible within the duration `m` plus one.
