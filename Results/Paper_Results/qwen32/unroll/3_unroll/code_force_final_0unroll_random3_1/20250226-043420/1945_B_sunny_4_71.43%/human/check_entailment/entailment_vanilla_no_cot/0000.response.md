Correctness: **False**

The provided program calculates the number of fireworks from each installation that can be visible within the first `m` minutes, but it does not account for the overlap of fireworks launched at different times by both installations. The program simply adds the number of fireworks from each installation, which is incorrect because it does not consider the simultaneous visibility of fireworks launched at different times.

For example, in the first test case with `a=6`, `b=7`, and `m=4`, the program calculates `A = int(4 / 6) + 1 = 1` and `B = int(4 / 7) + 1 = 1`, and then outputs `A + B = 2`. This is correct, but it does not generalize to other cases where fireworks from both installations can be visible at the same time for more than one minute.

The correct approach involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and then determining how many fireworks from each installation are visible within one LCM period, taking into account their overlap. The provided program does not implement this logic, so it is incorrect for general cases.
