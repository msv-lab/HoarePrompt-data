To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all iterations, we need to understand what the loop does in each iteration. For each test case, the loop reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. It then calculates `A` as the integer division of `m` by `a` plus one, and `B` as the integer division of `m` by `b` plus one. Finally, it prints the sum of `A` and `B`.

Since the loop runs `t` times, each time it will process a different set of `a`, `b`, and `m` values and print the corresponding result. The initial state only mentions `t` as the number of test cases, and the variables `a`, `b`, and `m` are read from the input within the loop.

After all iterations, the state of `t` remains unchanged, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` will be the values from the last test case that was processed. However, since the output of the loop is printed and not stored, the final output state will be a series of printed results, one for each test case.

Given that the problem asks for the output state in a specific format, and the output is a series of printed results, we can describe the output state as the sequence of printed sums of `A` and `B` for each test case.

Output State: **A series of integers, each representing the sum of `A` and `B` for each test case, where `A = int(m / a) + 1` and `B = int(m / b) + 1`.**
