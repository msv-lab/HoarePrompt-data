The code snippet provided assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer with a range, and for each of the `t` test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within a specified range. The provided code does not affect `t`, `a`, `b`, or `c`, and it introduces a new variable `n` which is assigned the value of an integer input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `n` is an input integer.**
