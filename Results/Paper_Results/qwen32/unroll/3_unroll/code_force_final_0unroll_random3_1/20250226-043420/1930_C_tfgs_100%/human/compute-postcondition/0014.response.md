Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `ans` is a list that includes its initial elements followed by `cnt` additional elements.
- Each of the `cnt` additional elements is one less than the previous one.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(*ans)
```

### Analysis:
- The `*` operator in the `print(*ans)` statement is used to unpack the list `ans` and print each element separated by spaces.
- The list `ans` consists of its initial elements followed by `cnt` additional elements, where each additional element is one less than the previous one.

### Example to Illustrate:
Let's assume `ans` initially contains `[5, 10]` and `cnt` is `3`. The additional elements to be added would be calculated as follows:
- The first additional element is `10 - 1 = 9`
- The second additional element is `9 - 1 = 8`
- The third additional element is `8 - 1 = 7`

Thus, `ans` would become `[5, 10, 9, 8, 7]`.

### General Case:
- If `ans` initially contains `n` elements, and `cnt` additional elements are added, each being one less than the previous one, the final list `ans` will be:
  - The initial `n` elements followed by `cnt` elements where each element is one less than the previous one.

### Output:
Since we don't have the exact initial elements of `ans` and the value of `cnt`, we can describe the output in a general form.

Output: **The initial elements of the list `ans` followed by `cnt` additional elements, each element being one less than the previous one.**
