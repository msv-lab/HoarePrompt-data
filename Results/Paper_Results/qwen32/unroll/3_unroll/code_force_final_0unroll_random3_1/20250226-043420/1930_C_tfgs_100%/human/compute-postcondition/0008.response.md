The variable `cnt` is assigned the value of `n - len(a)`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of unique integers where each integer `a_i` is the sum of the original `a_i` and `i + 1`, satisfying 2 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 + n, sorted in descending order; `counter` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the original `a`; `cur` is 0; `cnt` is `n - len(a)`.
