### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to generate the lexicographically largest possible array `b` from a set `S` which is populated by values derived from the array `a`. The values inserted into `S` are `a_i + i`, and since `S` is a set, duplicates are ignored. The final array `b` is constructed by sorting the elements of `S` in decreasing order.

Let's break down the given program to see if it correctly implements the solution:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of array `a` and the elements of `a`.

2. **Modifying Array `a`:**
   - For each element `a_i` in the array `a`, it adds `i + 1` to it, transforming `a` into an array of values `a_i + i`.

3. **Creating Set `S`:**
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each value in the modified array.
   - It then converts the modified array into a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in descending order.

4. **Constructing Array `b`:**
   - It initializes `cur` to 0, which keeps track of the remaining count of elements in `counter` that have not been fully used.
   - It initializes `cnt` to `n - len(a)`, which represents the number of elements that could have been inserted between the elements of `a` but were not due to the set's uniqueness constraint.
   - It iterates over the sorted unique values in `a`, appending them to `ans`.
   - For each unique value, it fills in the gaps (if any) between the current and previous unique values in `ans` with the largest possible values that are less than the previous value and greater than the current value, up to the limit of `cnt` and `cur`.
   - After processing all unique values, it appends the remaining required elements to `ans` by decrementing the last element of `ans`.

5. **Output:**
   - The final array `ans` is printed, which should be the lexicographically largest possible array `b`.

The program correctly handles the logic of generating the set `S` with unique values and constructing the array `b` by filling in the gaps between unique values. The use of `Counter` and set operations ensures that duplicates are handled correctly, and the sorting and gap-filling logic ensures that the resulting array `b` is lexicographically largest.

### Correctness: **True**
