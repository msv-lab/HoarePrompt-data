The code snippet creates a `Counter` object from the list `a`. This `Counter` object will count the frequency of each element in the list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is the sum of the original `a_i` and `i + 1`, satisfying 2 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 + n

After executing the code:
- `counter` is a `Counter` object that holds the frequency of each element in the list `a`.

The values of `t`, `n`, and the elements of `a` remain unchanged. The new variable `counter` is introduced to store the frequency of each element in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is the sum of the original `a_i` and `i + 1`, satisfying 2 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 + n; `counter` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `a`.**
