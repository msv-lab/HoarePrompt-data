The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. The variable `a` is initially described as a list of `n` integers, but this line of code replaces the initial list with a new list based on the input. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer a_i is input by the user and satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**
