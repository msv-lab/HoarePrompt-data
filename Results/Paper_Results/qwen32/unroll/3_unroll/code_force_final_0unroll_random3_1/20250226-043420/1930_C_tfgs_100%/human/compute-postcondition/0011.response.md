To determine the output state after the loop finishes executing, let's analyze each part of the loop and its effect on the variables.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `t`: An integer from 1 to 10^4 (unchanged).
   - `n`: An integer from 1 to 3 · 10^5 (unchanged).
   - `a`: A list of unique integers modified as `a_i = original_a_i + i + 1`, sorted in descending order (unchanged).
   - `counter`: A Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the original `a` (unchanged).
   - `cur`: Initialized to 0.
   - `cnt`: Initialized to `n - len(a)`.
   - `ans`: An empty list.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over the indices of `a`.
   - For each index `i`:
     - If `i > 0`, it calculates `adv` as the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`.
     - It then appends `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to `ans` for `j` in the range `adv`, and decrements `cnt` and `cur` by `adv`.
     - It appends `a[i]` to `ans`.
     - It decrements the count of `a[i]` in `counter` by 1.
     - It increments `cur` by the new count of `a[i]` in `counter`.

3. **Effect on Variables:**
   - `t`, `n`, `a`, and `counter` remain unchanged.
   - `ans` will contain the final sequence of numbers.
   - `cur` will be a value reflecting the remaining count of elements in `counter` that have not been fully used.
   - `cnt` will be a value reflecting the remaining count of elements that could have been inserted between the elements of `a`.

After the loop completes, the `ans` list will contain the final sequence of numbers, and `cur` and `cnt` will reflect the remaining counts as described.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of unique integers where each integer `a_i` is the sum of the original `a_i` and `i + 1`, satisfying 2 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 + n, sorted in descending order; `counter` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the original `a`; `cur` is the remaining count of elements in `counter` that have not been fully used; `cnt` is the remaining count of elements that could have been inserted between the elements of `a`; `ans` is the final sequence of numbers.**
