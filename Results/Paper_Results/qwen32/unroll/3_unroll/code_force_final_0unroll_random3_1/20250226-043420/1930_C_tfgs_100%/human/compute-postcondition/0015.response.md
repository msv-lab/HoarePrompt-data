The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters as defined in the provided code snippet. However, based on the parameter constraints and the context, it is implied that the function will process multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function will handle `t` such test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For each test case, the function will process the integer `n` and the list `a` as described. The function will return some output for each test case based on the provided integers and list.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` is between 1 and 10^9. The function returns an output for each test case based on the provided integers and list.**
