### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the optimal position to place a road dividing the village into left and right sides such that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with their side of the road. The position should be as close to the middle of the village as possible, and in case of ties, the smaller position should be chosen.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - Reads an integer `n` representing the number of houses.
   - Reads a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - Initializes `S` with a starting value of `[0, 0]`.
   - Iterates through the string `a` and constructs a prefix sum array `S` where `S[i]` contains the count of '0's and '1's up to the `i`-th house.
   - For example, if `a` is "0101", `S` becomes `[[0, 0], [1, 0], [1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2]]`.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - Iterates over each possible position `i` to place the road.
   - For each position `i`, calculates:
     - `left`: The count of '0's on the left side (houses from 1 to `i`).
     - `lsum`: The total number of houses on the left side.
     - `right`: The count of '1's on the right side (houses from `i+1` to `n`).
     - `rsum`: The total number of houses on the right side.
   - Checks if the number of '0's on the left side is at least half of the total houses on the left side and the number of '1's on the right side is at least half of the total houses on the right side.
   - If the condition is met, it checks if the current position `i` is closer to the middle of the village than the previously recorded position `ans`. If it is, it updates `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - Prints the position `ans` which is the optimal position to place the road.

#### Analysis of `func_2`:

- Handles multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it calls `func_1` to determine the optimal position for the road.

### Correctness:

The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the logic to find the optimal position to place the road based on the given conditions. The prefix sum array `S` helps efficiently calculate the number of '0's and '1's on either side of the road for each possible position, ensuring the conditions are checked accurately. The logic to find the position closest to the middle of the village is also correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
