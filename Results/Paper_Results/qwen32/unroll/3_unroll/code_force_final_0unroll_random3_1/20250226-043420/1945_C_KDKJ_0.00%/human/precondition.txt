The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5), followed by a string a of length n consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
