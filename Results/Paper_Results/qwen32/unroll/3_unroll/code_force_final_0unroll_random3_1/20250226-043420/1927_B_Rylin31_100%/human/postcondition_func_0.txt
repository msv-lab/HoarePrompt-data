The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it generates a string by mapping each integer in `a` to a corresponding character, ensuring that each integer maps to a unique character sequence. The function outputs this string for each test case. The input values `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged throughout the execution.
