To determine the output of the `print(*a)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state step-by-step:

1. **Initial State Details:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n` and `q` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5.
   - `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9.
   - `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of the original list `c`. 
     - This means `a[0] = c[0]`, `a[1] = c[0] + c[1]`, `a[2] = c[0] + c[1] + c[2]`, and so on.
   - `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of 1s and 2s based on whether `a[i] > 1`.
     - This detail is not relevant for the current print statement.

2. **Understanding the Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(*a)` prints all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

3. **Determining the Values of `a`:**
   - Since `a` is defined as the cumulative sum of the elements in the list `c`, the values of `a` can be expressed as follows:
     - `a[0] = c[0]`
     - `a[1] = c[0] + c[1]`
     - `a[2] = c[0] + c[1] + c[2]`
     - ...
     - `a[n-1] = c[0] + c[1] + ... + c[n-1]`

4. **Output Description:**
   - The print statement will output the cumulative sums of the list `c` from `a[0]` to `a[n-1]`, each separated by a space.

Given the information, the output will be the cumulative sums of the elements in the list `c`.

Output: **a[0] a[1] a[2] ... a[n-1] (where each a[i] is the cumulative sum of the first i+1 elements of the list c)**
