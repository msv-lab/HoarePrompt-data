In the provided for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `_` and `testcases`. The variable `_` is a conventional name for a variable that we don't plan to use within the loop, and `testcases` is the variable that determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

To ensure the loop executes, `testcases` must be a positive integer. The value of `_` does not need to be adjusted because it is not used in the loop body.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `testcases` is greater than 0. The value returned by `func_3()` should reflect this requirement.

State: **`testcases` is a positive integer (greater than 0)**

Since `func_3()` is responsible for providing the value of `testcases`, we should ensure that `func_3()` returns a positive integer. However, since we are only adjusting the state and not the function itself, we simply state that `testcases` must be greater than 0.
