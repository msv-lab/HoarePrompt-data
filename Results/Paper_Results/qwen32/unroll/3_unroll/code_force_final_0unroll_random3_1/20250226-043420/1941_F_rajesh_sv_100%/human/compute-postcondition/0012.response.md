The function `func_6` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`, which are integers with the constraints 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= m, k <= 2 * 10^5. It also accepts three lists: `A`, `D`, and `F`. List `A` contains `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 2 * 10^9 and is strictly increasing (a_i < a_{i+1}). List `D` contains `m` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9. List `F` contains `k` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9.

The function returns a value based on the provided lists and integers, but the specific return conditions are not detailed. Given the constraints and the nature of the input, it is likely that the function performs some form of computation or lookup involving the elements of `A`, `D`, and `F`.

Functionality: **The function accepts integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and lists `A`, `D`, and `F` with specified constraints. It returns a value based on these inputs.**
