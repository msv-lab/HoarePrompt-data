Let's break down the problem step by step using the given initial state:

1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `x` is an integer and equals 0.
   - `y` is an integer and is greater than 0.
   - At least one of `x` or `y` is not greater than 0. Since `x` is 0, this condition is satisfied.

2. **Expression Analysis:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
   - `y` is greater than 0, so `y / 2` will be a positive number.
   - `math.ceil()` is a function that rounds a number up to the nearest integer.

3. **Determining the Output:**
   - Since `y` is greater than 0 but we don't know its exact value, we can't determine a specific numerical output. However, we can describe it in terms of `y`.
   - The result of `y / 2` will be a positive number, and `math.ceil(y / 2)` will round this number up to the nearest integer.

Given the above analysis, the output will be the ceiling value of `y / 2`.

Output: **math.ceil(y / 2) (where y is a positive integer)**
