To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to analyze the given loop and its body. The loop iterates `t` times, and in each iteration, it calls the function `func_2()`. However, the function `func_2()` is not defined in the provided code, so we cannot determine the exact effect it has on the variables or the state of the program. 

Since the problem specifies that we should only change the values of the variables in the loop head and body and that the state of other variables remains unchanged, we can infer that the only variable that is directly affected by the loop is the loop counter, which is implicitly managed by the `range(t)` in the loop header. 

The loop counter itself is not explicitly named in the loop, but it iterates from 0 to `t-1`. After the loop finishes, the loop counter will have completed its iterations, and no further changes will occur to it within the context of this loop.

Given that the problem does not specify any changes to `t` within the loop and that `func_2()` does not affect the loop variable or any other variables mentioned in the initial state, the only thing we can definitively state about the output state is that the loop has finished executing `t` times.

Therefore, the output state will be the same as the initial state with respect to the variables mentioned, except for the implicit loop counter which is no longer in scope after the loop completes.

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged as a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.**
