Functionality: **The function takes two non-negative integer parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`. If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of the remainder when `extroverts` is divided by 3 and `universals` is less than 3, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3.**
