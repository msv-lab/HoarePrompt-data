You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Introverts (a)**: Each introvert needs a tent to themselves. So, `a` tents are needed for introverts.
2. **Extroverts (b)**: Each extrovert needs a tent with exactly two other people. So, `b` extroverts require `ceil(b/3)` tents (since each tent can accommodate 3 people).
3. **Universals (c)**: Universals can be placed in any tent.

The key requirement is that extroverts must always be in tents with exactly two other people. This means if we have `b` extroverts, the number of people they need to be with is `2*b`. These `2*b` people can be filled by introverts and universals.

- If `2*b > a + c`, it is impossible to accommodate all extroverts according to their wishes, and we should output `-1`.
- Otherwise, after placing `a` introverts in their own tents, we need to place the remaining `2*b - a` people in tents with extroverts. The remaining people can be universals. We then need to calculate the number of tents required for these groups.

### Solution Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - It first checks if `extroverts % 3 != 0`. If true, it means extroverts cannot be perfectly grouped into tents of 3.
   - It then checks if the remaining extroverts and universals can fill up the last tent. If `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it returns `None`, indicating it's impossible to accommodate the remaining extroverts.
   - Otherwise, it returns `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`, which is the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the total number of tents required.
   - It first calls `func_1` to get the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns `-1`, indicating it's impossible to accommodate all participants.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of tents required for introverts (`introverts`) and the tents required for extroverts and universals (`ret`).

### Testing the Solution:

Let's walk through the first test case `1 2 3`:
- `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `c = 3`
- `func_1(2, 3)` calculates `ceil((2 + 3) / 3) = 2`. This is because 2 extroverts need 1 tent, and the remaining 3 people (1 introvert + 2 universals) can fill up the second tent.
- `func_2(1, 2, 3)` returns `1 + 2 = 3`, which is correct.

Let's walk through the second test case `1 4 1`:
- `a = 1`, `b = 4`, `c = 1`
- `func_1(4, 1)` calculates `None` because `4 % 3 != 0` and `4 % 3 + 1 < 3`.
- `func_2(1, 4, 1)` returns `-1`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly handles the constraints and requirements of the problem. It correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed or determines if it's impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.
