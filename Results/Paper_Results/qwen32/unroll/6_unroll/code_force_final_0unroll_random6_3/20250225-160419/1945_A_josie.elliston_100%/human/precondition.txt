extroverts and universals are integers such that 0 <= extroverts, universals <= 10^9. Note that the function definition provided does not match the problem description, which includes introverts as well. The correct function definition should be `def f(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:`.
