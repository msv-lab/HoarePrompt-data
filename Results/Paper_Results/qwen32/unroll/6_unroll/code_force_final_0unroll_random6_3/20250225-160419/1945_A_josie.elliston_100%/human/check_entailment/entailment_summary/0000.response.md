### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the functions to determine if the program meets the problem description.

**Problem Requirements:**
- Each introvert needs a tent by themselves.
- Each extrovert needs a tent with exactly two others.
- Universals can be placed in any type of tent.
- If it's impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences, output -1.

**Functions Analysis:**

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Purpose:** Calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - **Logic:**
     - If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, it means there will be leftover extroverts who need to share a tent with others.
     - If the sum of the leftover extroverts and universals is less than 3, it's impossible to form a tent with the required 3 people, so it returns `None`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the total number of tents needed by taking the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3.
   - **Output:** Returns the number of tents or `None` if it's impossible to form valid tents.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - **Purpose:** Calculate the total number of tents needed for all participants.
   - **Logic:**
     - It first calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
     - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so it returns -1.
     - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1` (since each introvert needs a separate tent) and returns the total number of tents.
   - **Output:** Returns the total number of tents or -1 if it's impossible.

**Verification with Examples:**

- **Test Case 1: (1, 2, 3)**
  - Extroverts: 2 (not divisible by 3, remainder 2)
  - Universals: 3
  - Sum of remainder and universals: 5 (>= 3)
  - Tents for extroverts and universals: ceil((2 + 3) / 3) = 2
  - Total tents: 1 (introverts) + 2 = 3
  - **Result:** 3 (Correct)

- **Test Case 2: (1, 4, 1)**
  - Extroverts: 4 (not divisible by 3, remainder 1)
  - Universals: 1
  - Sum of remainder and universals: 2 (< 3)
  - **Result:** -1 (Correct)

- **Test Case 3: (1, 4, 2)**
  - Extroverts: 4 (not divisible by 3, remainder 1)
  - Universals: 2
  - Sum of remainder and universals: 3 (>= 3)
  - Tents for extroverts and universals: ceil((4 + 2) / 3) = 2
  - Total tents: 1 (introverts) + 2 = 3
  - **Result:** 3 (Correct)

- **Test Case 4: (1, 1, 1)**
  - Extroverts: 1 (not divisible by 3, remainder 1)
  - Universals: 1
  - Sum of remainder and universals: 2 (< 3)
  - **Result:** -1 (Correct)

- **Test Case 5: (1, 3, 2)**
  - Extroverts: 3 (divisible by 3)
  - Universals: 2
  - Tents for extroverts and universals: ceil((3 + 2) / 3) = 2
  - Total tents: 1 (introverts) + 2 = 3
  - **Result:** 3 (Correct)

- **Test Case 6: (19, 7, 18)**
  - Extroverts: 7 (not divisible by 3, remainder 1)
  - Universals: 18
  - Sum of remainder and universals: 19 (>= 3)
  - Tents for extroverts and universals: ceil((7 + 18) / 3) = 9
  - Total tents: 19 (introverts) + 9 = 28
  - **Result:** 28 (Correct)

- **Test Case 7: (0, 0, 0)**
  - No participants.
  - **Result:** 0 (Correct)

- **Test Case 8: (7, 0, 0)**
  - Only introverts.
  - **Result:** 7 (Correct)

- **Test Case 9: (0, 24, 0)**
  - Only extroverts.
  - Tents for extroverts and universals: ceil(24 / 3) = 8
  - **Result:** 8 (Correct)

- **Test Case 10: (1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000)**
  - Large numbers.
  - Tents for extroverts and universals: ceil((1000000000 + 1000000000) / 3) = 666666667
  - Total tents: 1000000000 (introverts) + 666666667 = 1666666667
  - **Result:** 1666666667 (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed or determines if it's impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.

**Correctness: True**
