Let's analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

We need to determine the minimum number of tents required to accommodate all participants according to their preferences:
- Introverts (a) must be alone in a tent.
- Extroverts (b) must share a tent with two others.
- Universals (c) can be in a tent with one, two, or three people.

Given these constraints, the solution involves:
1. Allocating one tent per introvert.
2. Allocating tents for extroverts and universals such that each tent has exactly three people, while respecting the constraints.

### Code Analysis

Let's break down the code provided:

#### Function 1: `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`

This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals:
- If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, it checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the last tent.
- If `extroverts % 3` is non-zero, it means the last tent will not be fully occupied by extroverts alone. The function then checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in that tent (`extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`). If not, it returns `None`, indicating it's impossible to accommodate everyone.
- If it's possible, it calculates the number of tents needed using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

#### Function 2: `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`

This function combines the results from `func_1` to determine the total number of tents:
- It first calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
- If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate everyone, so `func_2` returns `-1`.
- Otherwise, it adds the number of tents for introverts (which is equal to the number of introverts, since each introvert needs a tent of their own) to the result from `func_1`.

### Correctness Verification

Let's verify the code against the problem statement:

- **Introverts**: Each introvert needs a separate tent, so the number of tents for introverts is simply `a`.
- **Extroverts and Universals**: The function `func_1` correctly checks if the extroverts can be accommodated in groups of three and if the remaining spots can be filled by universals. If not, it returns `None`, which `func_2` correctly interprets as `-1`.
- **Combining Results**: The function `func_2` correctly combines the number of tents for introverts and the result from `func_1`.

### Conclusion

The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents required or if it's impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.

**Correctness: True**
