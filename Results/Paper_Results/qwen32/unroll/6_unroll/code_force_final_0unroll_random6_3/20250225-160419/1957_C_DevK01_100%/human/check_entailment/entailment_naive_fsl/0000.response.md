Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Modulo Operation Error**:
   - The modulo operation in the `func_1` function is incorrect. The modulo should be `10**9 + 7`, not `7 + 10**9`. This will lead to incorrect results.

2. **Handling of `n`**:
   - The value of `n` is decremented based on the moves, but the logic for decrementing `n` is not entirely correct. When `a != b`, both positions `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` are occupied, and `n` should be decremented by 2. When `a == b`, only one position is occupied, and `n` should be decremented by 1. This part seems correct, but the issue arises in the calculation of possible configurations.

3. **Dynamic Programming Calculation**:
   - The `func_1` function calculates the number of possible configurations using a dynamic programming approach. However, the formula used inside the loop is incorrect. The correct formula for the number of configurations is more complex and involves combinatorial calculations, which are not correctly implemented here.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases properly. For example, when `n` becomes 0 or 1, the number of configurations should be handled separately, but the current code does not account for these scenarios correctly.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

**Example Input**:
```
1
4 1
1 2
```

**Expected Output**:
```
3
```

**Actual Output**:
The program would likely output an incorrect value due to the issues mentioned above.

To fix the program, the dynamic programming calculation should be corrected, and the modulo operation should be properly applied. Additionally, edge cases should be handled explicitly.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
