Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of possible final configurations of a chessboard after a series of moves are made by two players placing rooks under specific rules. The key part of the problem is understanding how the number of valid configurations changes as moves are made.

The program reads the number of test cases, for each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already made. For each move, it updates the size of the remaining board `n` by subtracting 2 if the rooks are not placed on the same row and column (i.e., `a != b`), otherwise, it subtracts 1 (i.e., `a == b`).

After processing all moves, the program calls `func_1(n)` to compute the number of possible final configurations for the remaining board size `n`. The function `func_1(n)` uses dynamic programming to compute this value based on the recurrence relation:
- `dp[0] = 1`
- `dp[1] = 1`
- For `i >= 2`, `dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i-2]) % (10^9 + 7)`

The recurrence relation and the dynamic programming approach appear to correctly model the problem, as the number of configurations is based on the number of ways to place rooks on an `n x n` board with the given constraints.

The execution summary indicates that `func_1(n)` correctly computes the value of `dp[n]` for the given `n`. Therefore, the program correctly handles the problem requirements and computes the correct number of possible final configurations for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
