In the given task, the for loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will iterate over the range starting from 2 up to and including `n`. To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to make sure that `n` is at least 2. The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts since it is initialized by the `range` function.

The state provided includes `t`, `n`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`, and `dp`. However, according to the instructions, we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Since `i` is automatically initialized by the `range` function, we only need to ensure that `n` is such that the range `range(2, n + 1)` is non-empty. This means `n` must be at least 2.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is at least 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 2, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i` where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, `dp` is `[1, 1]`**
