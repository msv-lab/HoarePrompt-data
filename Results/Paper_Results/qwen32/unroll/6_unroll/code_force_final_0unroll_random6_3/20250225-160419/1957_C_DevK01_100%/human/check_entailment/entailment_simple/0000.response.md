### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic behind the computation and compare it with the problem requirements.

1. **Game Dynamics**:
   - The game involves placing rooks on an n x n chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - Moves are made alternately between the player and the computer.
   - The player starts first and places white rooks, while the computer places black rooks at mirrored positions.
   - If a move is on the diagonal (r = c), the computer skips its turn.

2. **State Tracking**:
   - The program iterates through the given k moves and adjusts the size of the board (n) accordingly.
   - For each move (r, c):
     - If r â‰  c, it means the computer will place a rook at (c, r), effectively removing two positions (r, c) and (c, r) from the board.
     - If r = c, the computer skips its turn, removing only one position (r, c) from the board.
   - This logic correctly reflects the game dynamics and reduces the available positions for future moves.

3. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` calculates the number of possible final configurations for an n x n board using dynamic programming.
   - The recursive formula used in `func_1` is:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \times (i-1) \times dp[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the combinatorial nature of placing rooks such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - The base cases are `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 1`.

4. **Correctness of the DP Formula**:
   - The formula is based on the fact that for an n x n board, the number of ways to place rooks without any attacks can be derived from smaller subproblems.
   - The term `2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]` accounts for the choices available when placing a rook in a new position and considering the mirrored placement by the computer.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as n = 1 and k = 0 correctly.
   - It also correctly processes the sum of n across all test cases, ensuring it does not exceed 3 x 10^5, as required by the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, including handling the game dynamics and using dynamic programming to compute the number of possible final configurations. The provided code and the dynamic programming formula appear to be consistent with the problem requirements.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The program correctly implements the logic to handle the game dynamics and uses dynamic programming to compute the number of possible final configurations. The formula used in the dynamic programming function is consistent with the problem requirements, and the program handles edge cases appropriately.
Correctness: **True**
