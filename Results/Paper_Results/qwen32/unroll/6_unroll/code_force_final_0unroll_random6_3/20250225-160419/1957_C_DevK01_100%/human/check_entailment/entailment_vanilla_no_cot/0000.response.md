Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Modulo Operation Error**: The modulo value should be `10^9 + 7` (i.e., `1000000007`), not `7 + 10 ** 9`. The program incorrectly uses `(7 + 10 ** 9)`.

2. **Function Call Error**: The function `func_1(n)` is called before it is defined in the code. In Python, functions must be defined before they are called.

3. **Logic for Reducing `n`**: The logic for reducing `n` is incorrect. When a rook is placed, it should reduce the number of available rows and columns by 1, not by 2 if `a != b`. The program incorrectly reduces `n` by 2 when `a != b` and by 1 when `a == b`.

4. **Handling of `n`**: After `k` moves, the number of available positions `n` should be reduced accordingly, and then the number of possible configurations should be computed. The current implementation does not correctly account for the reduction in available positions.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    dp = [1, 1]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp += [(dp[-1] + (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % MOD]
        dp.pop(0)
    return dp[-1]

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    for _ in range(k):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        n -= 1  # Each move reduces the number of available positions by 1
    print(func_1(n))
```

This corrected version fixes the issues mentioned above and should work correctly for the given problem.
