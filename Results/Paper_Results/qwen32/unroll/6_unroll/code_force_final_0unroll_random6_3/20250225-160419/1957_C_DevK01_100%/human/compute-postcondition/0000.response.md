The code snippet provided initializes a list `dp` with the values `[1, 1]`. This action does not affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `r_i`, and `c_i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n. It is guaranteed that the `k` moves and the implied computer moves are valid. `dp` is `[1, 1]`.**
