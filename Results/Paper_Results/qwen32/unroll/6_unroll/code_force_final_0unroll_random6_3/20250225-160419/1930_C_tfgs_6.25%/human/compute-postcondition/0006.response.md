The code snippet sorts the list `a` in descending order. The values of `n` and `counter` remain unchanged. The list `a` is now sorted from the largest to the smallest element.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the length of array `a`; `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with duplicates removed; `counter` is a `Counter` object that contains the frequency of each unique element in the original list `a` before duplicates were removed.**
