Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the length of array `a` before duplicates were removed; `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with duplicates removed; `counter` is a `Counter` object that contains the frequency of each unique element in the original list `a` before duplicates were removed; `cnt` is the number of duplicate elements that were removed, calculated as `n - len(a)`; `ans` is an empty list.**

In natural language, the output state is: `n` remains the input integer representing the length of the original array before duplicates were removed; `a` remains a sorted list of integers in descending order with duplicates removed; `counter` remains a `Counter` object that contains the frequency of each unique element in the original list before duplicates were removed; `cnt` remains the number of duplicate elements that were removed, calculated as `n - len(a)`; `ans` is now an empty list.
