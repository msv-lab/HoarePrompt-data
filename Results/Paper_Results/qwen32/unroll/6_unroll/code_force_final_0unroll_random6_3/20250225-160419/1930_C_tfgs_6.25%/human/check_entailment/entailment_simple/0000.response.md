### Reasoning:

The program aims to achieve the following:
1. For each element in the array `a`, add its index (1-based) to the element.
2. Insert the resulting value into a set to ensure uniqueness.
3. Sort the unique values in descending order to form the array `b`.

The program logic is as follows:
- The function `func_1` is called for each test case.
- The array `a` is read and each element is updated to `a[i] + i + 1`.
- A `Counter` is used to count the occurrences of each unique value.
- The set of unique values is sorted in descending order.
- The program then reconstructs the array `b` by inserting duplicates back in the correct positions based on the counts from the `Counter`.

Let's break down the program's steps to verify correctness:

1. **Updating the Array Elements**:
   - The elements of `a` are updated to `a[i] + i + 1`. This step correctly implements the first step of the problem statement.

2. **Counting Unique Values**:
   - A `Counter` is used to count the occurrences of each unique value after the update. This ensures that we know how many times each value appears.

3. **Sorting Unique Values**:
   - The unique values are sorted in descending order. This step ensures that the final array `b` is sorted as required.

4. **Reconstructing the Array `b`**:
   - The program reconstructs the array `b` by iterating through the sorted unique values and inserting duplicates based on the counts from the `Counter`. This ensures that the final array `b` contains the correct number of each unique value.

5. **Handling Remaining Duplicates**:
   - If there are any remaining duplicates (i.e., `cnt` is not zero), the program appends the smallest possible values to `b` until all duplicates are accounted for. This step ensures that the final array `b` has the correct length and is lexicographically largest.

Given the above steps, the program correctly implements the logic to construct the lexicographically largest array `b` as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem. Thus, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
