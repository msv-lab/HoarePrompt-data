The code snippet calculates the difference between the original length of the list `a` (before duplicates were removed) and the current length of the list `a` (after duplicates were removed). This difference is stored in the variable `cnt`.

Given that `counter` is a `Counter` object that contains the frequency of each unique element in the original list `a` before duplicates were removed, the sum of the values in `counter` would give the original length of the list `a`.

However, the problem statement only provides `n` which is the original length of the list `a` before duplicates were removed, and `a` which is the list after duplicates were removed. The variable `cnt` is calculated as `n - len(a)`, which represents the number of duplicate elements that were removed.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the length of array `a` before duplicates were removed; `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with duplicates removed; `counter` is a `Counter` object that contains the frequency of each unique element in the original list `a` before duplicates were removed; `cnt` is the number of duplicate elements that were removed, calculated as `n - len(a)`.**
