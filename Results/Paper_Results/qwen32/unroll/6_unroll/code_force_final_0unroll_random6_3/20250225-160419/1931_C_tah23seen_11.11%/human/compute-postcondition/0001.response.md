The variable `j` is assigned the value `len(arr) - 1`, which is `n - 1` since `n` is the length of the list `arr`. The values of `arr` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), and `n` is the length of the list `arr`; `i` is 0; `j` is `n - 1`.**
