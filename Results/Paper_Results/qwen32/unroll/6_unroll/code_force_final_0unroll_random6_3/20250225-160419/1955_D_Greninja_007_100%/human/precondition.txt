n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5. a is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. b is a list of m integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. Similarly, the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
