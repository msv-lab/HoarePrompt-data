The code snippet provided only increments the value of the variable `ans` by 1. Therefore, the value of `ans` changes from its initial value of 0 to 1. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `cb`, `ca`, `sm`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; `cb` is a `Counter` object that contains the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`; `ca` is a `Counter` object that contains the frequency of each element in the sorted list `a[:m]`; `ans` is 1; `sm` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of the common elements between `ca` and `cb`. The current value of `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
