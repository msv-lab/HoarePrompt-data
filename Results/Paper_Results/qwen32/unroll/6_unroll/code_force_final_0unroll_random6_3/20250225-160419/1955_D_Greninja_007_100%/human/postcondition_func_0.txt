The function `func_1` calculates and returns the count of iterations where the sum of the minimum frequencies of common elements between the frequency distributions of the first `m` elements of list `a` and list `b` is greater than or equal to `k`. It then slides a window of size `m` across the rest of list `a`, updating the count similarly for each new window.
