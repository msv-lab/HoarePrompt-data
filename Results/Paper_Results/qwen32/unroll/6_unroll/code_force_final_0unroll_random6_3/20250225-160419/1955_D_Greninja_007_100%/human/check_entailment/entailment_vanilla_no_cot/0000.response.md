Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a logical error in the way it updates the count of matching elements (`sm`) when sliding the window over the array `a`. Specifically, the conditions to adjust `sm` are not correctly implemented. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program correctly initializes `cb` (counter for array `b`) and `ca` (counter for the first `m` elements of array `a`).
   - It then calculates `sm`, which is the sum of the minimum values between `ca` and `cb` (i.e., the number of common elements in the first `m` elements of `a` and `b`).

2. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program attempts to slide the window over `a` by adding the new element (`a[r]`) and removing the old element (`a[r - m]`).
   - However, the conditions to adjust `sm` are incorrect. The conditions `if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]` and `if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]` are not appropriate for updating `sm`.

Here is a corrected version of the sliding window part:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    cb = Counter(b)
    ca = Counter(a[:m])
    ans = 0
    
    # Initial count of matching elements
    sm = sum((ca & cb).values())
    if sm >= k:
        ans += 1
    
    # Sliding window
    for r in range(m, n):
        # Add new element to the window
        ca[a[r]] += 1
        if ca[a[r]] == cb[a[r]]:
            sm += 1
        elif ca[a[r]] == cb[a[r]] + 1:
            sm -= 1
        
        # Remove the old element from the window
        ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
        if ca[a[r - m]] == cb[a[r - m]] - 1:
            sm -= 1
        elif ca[a[r - m]] == cb[a[r - m]]:
            sm += 1
        
        if sm >= k:
            ans += 1
    
    return ans

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, m, k, a, b))
```

In this corrected version:
- When adding a new element `a[r]` to the window, if `ca[a[r]]` becomes equal to `cb[a[r]]`, it means we have found a new matching element, so `sm` is incremented.
- If `ca[a[r]]` becomes equal to `cb[a[r]] + 1`, it means we have added an extra occurrence of an element that was already fully matched, so `sm` is decremented.
- When removing an old element `a[r - m]` from the window, if `ca[a[r - m]]` becomes equal to `cb[a[r - m]] - 1`, it means we have lost a matching element, so `sm` is decremented.
- If `ca[a[r - m]]` becomes equal to `cb[a[r - m]]`, it means we have removed an extra occurrence of an element that was fully matched, so `sm` is incremented.

This ensures that `sm` correctly reflects the number of matching elements in the current window at all times.
