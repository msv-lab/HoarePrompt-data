Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists `a` and `b`. The function calculates and returns the count of iterations where the sum of the minimum frequencies of the common elements between the frequency distributions of `a` and `b` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
