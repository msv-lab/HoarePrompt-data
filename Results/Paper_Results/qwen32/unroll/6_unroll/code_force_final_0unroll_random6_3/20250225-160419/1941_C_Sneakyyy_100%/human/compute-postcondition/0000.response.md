In the provided for loop, the loop variable is `_`, and the range is determined by the integer value obtained from `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The variables `n` and `s` are defined inside the loop and are not part of the loop head, so we only need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the input `t`.

Given that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `t` is at least 1. The variables `n` and `s` do not need to be adjusted since they are defined within the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
