You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50,000, and k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The array a is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 50,000.

    #State: The output state consists of T test cases, each producing two lines of output. For each test case, the first line contains up to k integers selected from the left half (lft) and the right half (rgt) of the input list `lst`, prioritizing pairs of identical integers from each half. If there are not enough pairs to reach k integers, single integers from the left half are added until k integers are reached. The second line follows the same logic but exclusively uses integers from the right half (rgt). The state of variables `T`, `t`, `n`, `k`, and `lst` remains unchanged after each iteration of the loop, except for the temporary variables `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, `sng`, and `sz` which are recalculated for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing half the length of the array, an integer `k` which is a positive integer not exceeding half of `n`, and an array `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The function returns a value (or performs an action) based on these inputs, but the specific return value or action is not detailed in the provided information.
