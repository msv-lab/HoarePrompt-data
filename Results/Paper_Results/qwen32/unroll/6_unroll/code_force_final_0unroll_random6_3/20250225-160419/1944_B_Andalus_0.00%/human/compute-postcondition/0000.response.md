The variable `T` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will hold the integer value provided by the user input. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the array `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`T` is an integer provided by the user input; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50,000, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋; the array `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.**
