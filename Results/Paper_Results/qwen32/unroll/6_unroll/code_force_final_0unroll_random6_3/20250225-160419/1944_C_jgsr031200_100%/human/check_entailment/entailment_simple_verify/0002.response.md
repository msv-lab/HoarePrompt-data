### Reasoning:

Let's evaluate the program based on the problem description, the code, and the annotated version provided.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it. The strategy involves both players making moves that lead to an optimal outcome based on their respective goals.

#### Key Points:
1. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
2. **Optimal Play**: Alice and Bob play optimally, meaning they make moves that maximize or minimize the MEX, respectively.
3. **Game Dynamics**: Alice starts by picking an element, appends it to `c`, and removes it from `a`. Bob then picks an element and removes it from `a`. This continues until `a` is empty.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
- It then calls the function `func_1(arr)` which calculates the MEX of the array `arr` based on the frequencies of elements.

#### Function `func_1(arr)`:
1. It initializes a frequency array `freq` of size `n+1` to count occurrences of each element in `arr`.
2. It counts the frequency of each element in `arr`.
3. It iterates through the frequency array to find the smallest index `i` such that `freq[i]` is either 0 or 1.
4. It prints this index `i` as the MEX.

#### Correctness Check:
- The program correctly counts the frequency of each element in `arr`.
- The program correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer that is either not present in `arr` or appears only once, which is the MEX.
- The program assumes that the optimal play strategy is inherently handled by the MEX calculation, which is correct because the MEX is a direct result of the unique elements and their frequencies in `arr`.

#### Evaluation of Annotations:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
- The annotations confirm that the frequency array `freq` is correctly populated.
- The annotations confirm that the loop correctly identifies the MEX by checking the first index where the frequency is either 0 or 1.

### Final Assessment:
The program correctly calculates the MEX of the array `arr` based on the frequencies of elements, which is the optimal result for the game when both players play optimally. The annotations support the correctness of the program's logic and behavior.

**Final: True**
