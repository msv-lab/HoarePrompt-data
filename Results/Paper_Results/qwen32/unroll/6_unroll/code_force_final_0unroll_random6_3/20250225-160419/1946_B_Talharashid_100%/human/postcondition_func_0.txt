The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of integers `n` and `k`, and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on a specific formula involving the maximum subarray sum, the value of `k`, and the sum of the array elements, modulo 1000000007.
