Let's analyze the given Python program and determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to maximize the sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations. In each operation, we can select any contiguous subarray and insert its sum anywhere in the array. The goal is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` such operations, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Key Observations
1. **Maximizing the Sum:** The key to maximizing the sum is to add the maximum possible subarray sum repeatedly. This is because adding a larger number will always lead to a larger final sum.
2. **Subarray Sum:** The maximum subarray sum can be found using Kadane's algorithm.
3. **Effect of Operations:** If the maximum subarray sum is positive, adding it repeatedly will maximize the sum. If it is negative or zero, adding it won't increase the sum.
4. **Modulo Operation:** Since the result can be very large, we need to take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the provided code and check its logic:

```python
import math

def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        c = 0
        maxi = 0
        for ele in l:
            if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
                maxi = max(c, maxi)
                c = 0
            else:
                c += ele
                maxi = max(c, maxi)
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)
```

#### Issues in the Code
1. **Incorrect Kadane's Implementation:** The provided code does not correctly implement Kadane's algorithm. Kadane's algorithm should iterate through the list and keep track of the maximum subarray sum found so far. The current code incorrectly resets the sum `c` when it encounters a negative number and doesn't handle the subarray sum correctly.
2. **Logic for Maximum Subarray Sum:** The code does not correctly compute the maximum subarray sum. It should use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum and then use that value to calculate the final result.
3. **Handling Large Numbers:** The code correctly uses modulo \(10^9 + 7\) but the logic for calculating the final sum is incorrect due to the incorrect maximum subarray sum.

### Correct Approach
1. **Use Kadane's Algorithm:** Correctly compute the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm.
2. **Calculate the Final Sum:** If the maximum subarray sum is positive, the final sum can be calculated as \((\text{max\_subarray\_sum} \times (2^k - 1) + \text{sum\_of\_array}) \mod (10^9 + 7)\). If the maximum subarray sum is non-positive, the final sum is simply the sum of the original array modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conclusion
The provided code is incorrect due to the improper implementation of Kadane's algorithm and the incorrect logic for calculating the final sum.

Correctness: **False**
