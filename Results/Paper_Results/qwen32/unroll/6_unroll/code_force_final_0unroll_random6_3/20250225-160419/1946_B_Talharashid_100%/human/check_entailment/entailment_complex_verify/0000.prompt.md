You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of integers `n` and `k`, and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on a specific formula involving the maximum subarray sum, the value of `k`, and the sum of the array elements, modulo 1000000007.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting any contiguous subarray and inserting the sum of that subarray anywhere in the array. The program's logic is flawed and does not consider the optimal strategy to achieve the maximum sum.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Subarray Sum**:
   The program tries to find the maximum subarray sum (`maxi`) using a logic that is not entirely correct. It resets the cumulative sum (`c`) when it encounters a negative number that is greater than the current cumulative sum. This logic does not correctly handle all cases, especially when there are multiple negative numbers or when the optimal subarray includes negative numbers that are outweighed by positive numbers.

2. **Incorrect Use of `2 ** k`**:
   The program multiplies the maximum subarray sum (`maxi`) by `2 ** k`, which is incorrect. The correct strategy involves adding the maximum subarray sum to the total sum of the array repeatedly, but this does not mean simply multiplying by `2 ** k`. The correct approach would involve adding the maximum subarray sum to the total sum `k` times, which can be optimized using a more sophisticated method such as binary exponentiation.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   While the program correctly applies the modulo operation at the end, the incorrect logic leading up to this step means that the final result is not correct.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 3
1 -2 3
```
The correct approach would involve selecting the subarray `[1, -2, 3]` (which has a sum of 2) and adding this sum to the array `k` times. The optimal sequence of operations would be:
1. Original array: `[1, -2, 3]`
2. After 1st operation: `[1, -2, 3, 2]` (sum = 4)
3. After 2nd operation: `[1, -2, 3, 2, 2]` (sum = 6)
4. After 3rd operation: `[1, -2, 3, 2, 2, 2]` (sum = 8)

The correct output for this test case is `8`.

However, the provided program would not produce this result. It would incorrectly calculate the maximum subarray sum and then apply the incorrect logic to compute the final sum.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
