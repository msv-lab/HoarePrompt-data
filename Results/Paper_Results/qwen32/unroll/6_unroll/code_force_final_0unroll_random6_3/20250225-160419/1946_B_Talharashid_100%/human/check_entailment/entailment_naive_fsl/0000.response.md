Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting any contiguous subarray and inserting the sum of that subarray anywhere in the array. The program's logic is flawed and does not consider the optimal strategy to achieve the maximum sum.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Subarray Sum**:
   The program tries to find the maximum subarray sum (`maxi`) using a logic that is not entirely correct. It resets the cumulative sum (`c`) when it encounters a negative number that is greater than the current cumulative sum. This logic does not correctly handle all cases, especially when there are multiple negative numbers or when the optimal subarray includes negative numbers that are outweighed by positive numbers.

2. **Incorrect Use of `2 ** k`**:
   The program multiplies the maximum subarray sum (`maxi`) by `2 ** k`, which is incorrect. The correct strategy involves adding the maximum subarray sum to the total sum of the array repeatedly, but this does not mean simply multiplying by `2 ** k`. The correct approach would involve adding the maximum subarray sum to the total sum `k` times, which can be optimized using a more sophisticated method such as binary exponentiation.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   While the program correctly applies the modulo operation at the end, the incorrect logic leading up to this step means that the final result is not correct.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 3
1 -2 3
```
The correct approach would involve selecting the subarray `[1, -2, 3]` (which has a sum of 2) and adding this sum to the array `k` times. The optimal sequence of operations would be:
1. Original array: `[1, -2, 3]`
2. After 1st operation: `[1, -2, 3, 2]` (sum = 4)
3. After 2nd operation: `[1, -2, 3, 2, 2]` (sum = 6)
4. After 3rd operation: `[1, -2, 3, 2, 2, 2]` (sum = 8)

The correct output for this test case is `8`.

However, the provided program would not produce this result. It would incorrectly calculate the maximum subarray sum and then apply the incorrect logic to compute the final sum.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
