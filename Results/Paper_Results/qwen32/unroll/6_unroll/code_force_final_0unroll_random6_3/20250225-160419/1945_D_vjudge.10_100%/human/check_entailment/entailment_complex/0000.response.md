Reasoning:

The provided code snippet contains a logical flaw in the implementation of the `func_1` function, which is supposed to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill will have to spend in order to be among the first `m` people in line.

Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `x` is initialized to 0. This variable is intended to keep track of the cumulative cost of bribes.
   - `pergunta` is initialized to infinity (`float('inf')`). This variable is intended to store the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position less than `m`.

2. **Loop through the queue**:
   - The loop iterates from the last person in the queue (`n-1`) to the first (`0`).
   - For each person `i`:
     - If `i < m`, it updates `pergunta` to be the minimum of its current value and `x + a[i]`. This is correct in the sense that it considers the cost if Kirill were to swap with the `i-th` person.
     - It then adds the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x`. This is incorrect because it does not accurately reflect the cost of bribes. The cost of bribing should only be added if Kirill actually performs the bribe, which is not the case for all `i`.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints `pergunta`, which is supposed to be the minimum cost for Kirill to be among the first `m` people.

The issue is that the cost `x` is being incremented by the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i`, which is not the correct approach. The cost should only be added if Kirill actually bribes someone, and the cost should reflect the actual sequence of bribes needed to place Kirill among the first `m` people.

Therefore, the current implementation does not correctly compute the minimum cost for Kirill to be among the first `m` people in line.

Correctness: **False**
