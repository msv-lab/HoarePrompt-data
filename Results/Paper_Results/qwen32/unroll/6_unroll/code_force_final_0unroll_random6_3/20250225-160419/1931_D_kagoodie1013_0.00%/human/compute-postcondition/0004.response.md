Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers (a). For each test case, the function calculates the count of pairs (a_i, a_j) where i < j and the product of a_i and a_j is divisible by both x and y. The function returns a list `results` containing these counts for each test case.**
