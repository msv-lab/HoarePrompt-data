Correctness: **False**

The given program contains a logic error in the calculation of the `mod_x` value. The program uses `-num % x` which is incorrect for determining whether `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`. Instead, it should use `num % x` for both `a_i % x` and `a_j % x` for checking the condition `a_i + a_j % x == 0`.

Here's the corrected logic for counting the beautiful pairs:

```python
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        mod_xy_map = {}
        for num in arr:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            mod_xy_key = (mod_x, mod_y)
            # Check how many pairs (i, j) we can form with the current number
            count += mod_xy_map.get((mod_x, mod_y), 0)
            mod_xy_map[mod_xy_key] = mod_xy_map.get(mod_xy_key, 0) + 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

The corrected program uses a single dictionary `mod_xy_map` to store pairs of `(mod_x, mod_y)` and counts how many times each pair has been seen. For each number in the array, it checks how many times the same `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair has been seen before and adds that count to the result. This ensures that both conditions (`a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`) are satisfied by checking for the same `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair.
