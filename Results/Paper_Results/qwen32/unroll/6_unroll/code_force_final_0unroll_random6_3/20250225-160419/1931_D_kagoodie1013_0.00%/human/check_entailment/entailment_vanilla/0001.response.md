Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to find the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A pair of indices \((i, j)\) with \(1 \le i < j \le n\) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

### Conditions Analysis

1. **Condition 1: \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\)**
   - This implies \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\).
   - Therefore, for a given \(a_i\), we need to find \(a_j\) such that \(a_j \equiv -a_i \pmod{x}\).

2. **Condition 2: \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\)**
   - This implies \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\).
   - Therefore, for a given \(a_i\), we need to find \(a_j\) such that \(a_j \equiv a_i \pmod{y}\).

### Approach Analysis

The program uses two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to count the number of elements that have a specific remainder when divided by \(x\) and \(y\) respectively. 

For each element `num` in the array:
- It calculates `mod_x = -num % x` and `mod_y = num % y`.
- It increments the count by the number of elements previously seen that satisfy the conditions (i.e., `mod_x_map[mod_x]` and `mod_y_map[mod_y]`).
- It then updates the dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` to include the current element.

### Correctness Analysis

Let's check if the approach correctly counts the beautiful pairs:
- The program correctly identifies pairs where \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\) and \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\).
- However, there is a mistake in the calculation of `mod_x`. It should be `mod_x = num % x` instead of `mod_x = -num % x`. The correct condition should be checking if the current element can pair with any previously seen element that satisfies both conditions.

### Correct Calculation

The correct approach should be:
- For each element `num` in the array:
  - Calculate `mod_x = num % x` and `mod_y = num % y`.
  - The condition `a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}` translates to `a_j \equiv -a_i \pmod{x}`, which is equivalent to `a_j \equiv (x - a_i % x) % x \pmod{x}`.
  - Check how many elements with `mod_x_key = (x - num % x) % x` and `mod_y_key = num % y` have been seen before.
  - Update the dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` with the current element.

### Conclusion

The provided program contains an error in the calculation of `mod_x`. It should be `mod_x = num % x` and the condition to check in the map should be `(x - num % x) % x`.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
