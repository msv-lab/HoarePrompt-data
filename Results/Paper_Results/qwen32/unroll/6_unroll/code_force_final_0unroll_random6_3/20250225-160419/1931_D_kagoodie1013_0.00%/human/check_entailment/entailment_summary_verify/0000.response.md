### Reasoning:

The original assessment is **inaccurate**. Let's break down the issue and verify the correctness of the provided program.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- A pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) (with \(1 \le i < j \le n\)) is considered beautiful if:
  - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
  - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

#### Analysis of the Provided Program:
- The program uses two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to store the counts of elements based on their modulo values.
- For each element `num` in the array:
  - It calculates `mod_x = -num % x` and `mod_y = num % y`.
  - It increments the count by the number of elements seen so far that satisfy the conditions:
    - `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` counts elements where `a_i % x == -a_j % x`.
    - `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` counts elements where `a_i % y == a_j % y`.
  - It then updates the dictionaries with the current element's modulo values.

#### Issues in the Provided Program:
- The calculation `mod_x = -num % x` is incorrect. This does not correctly represent the condition \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\). Instead, it should be `mod_x = num % x` and then check for the complement `(x - mod_x) % x` when counting pairs.
- The function summary provided is also incorrect. It states that the function calculates pairs where the product of `a_i` and `a_j` is divisible by both `x` and `y`, which is not the requirement.

#### Corrected Program:
The corrected version of the program should use:
- `mod_x = num % x` and then check for `(x - mod_x) % x` when counting pairs.
- `mod_y = num % y` directly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        mod_x_map = {}
        mod_y_map = {}
        for num in arr:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            count += mod_x_map.get((x - mod_x) % x, 0) * mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
            mod_x_key = mod_x
            mod_y_key = mod_y
            mod_x_map[mod_x_key] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1
            mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

#### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly identify beautiful pairs due to the incorrect calculation of `mod_x`. The corrected version provided in the original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True** (The corrected version of the program is correct, but the original program as given is incorrect.)
