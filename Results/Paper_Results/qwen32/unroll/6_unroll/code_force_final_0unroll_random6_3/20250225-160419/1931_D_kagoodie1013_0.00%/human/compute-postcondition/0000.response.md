Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case. Each test case consists of three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers (a). The integers n, x, and y satisfy 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and the elements of the list a satisfy 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The total number of elements across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `results` is an empty list.**

In simple terms, `test_cases` remains the same as it was, and `results` is now an empty list.
