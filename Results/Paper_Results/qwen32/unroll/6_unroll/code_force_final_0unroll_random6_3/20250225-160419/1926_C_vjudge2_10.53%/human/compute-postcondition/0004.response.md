The code snippet creates a list named `values` with a length equal to the maximum value in the `numbers` list plus one, and initializes all elements of this list to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Since `t` is the number of test cases and `numbers` is a list of `t` integers, the only change is the creation and initialization of the `values` list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each read from the input; `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.**
