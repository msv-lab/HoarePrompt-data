You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the largest number Vladislav writes for each test case.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        numbers.append(n)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each read from the input.
    values = [(0) for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    sum_values = [(0) for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        
        total += i
        
        sum_values[i] = total
        
    #State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each read from the input; `values` is a list where the first 10 elements are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] and the rest are 0; `sum_values` is a list where the first 10 elements are [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45] and the rest are 0; `total` is 45.
    for i in range(10, n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
        
    #State: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; numbers is a list containing t integers, each read from the input; values is a list where the first 10 elements are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] and the rest are computed based on the loop; sum_values is a list where the first 10 elements are [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45] and the rest are computed based on the loop; total is 45.
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])
        
    #State: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; numbers is a list containing t integers, each read from the input; values is a list where the first 10 elements are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] and the rest are computed based on the loop; sum_values is a list where the first 10 elements are [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45] and the rest are computed based on the loop; total is 45.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each of the next `t` lines, it receives an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the largest number Vladislav writes for each test case. The function processes each test case and returns the result for each one.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
