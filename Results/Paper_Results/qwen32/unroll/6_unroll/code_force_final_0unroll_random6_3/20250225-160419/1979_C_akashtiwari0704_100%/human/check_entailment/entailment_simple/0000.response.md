### Reasoning:

The given program aims to solve the problem by finding a suitable distribution of bets such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.

2. **Finding the LCM**:
   - The program calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`. This is done using the `gcd` function to iteratively compute the LCM of the list.

3. **Calculating Bets**:
   - The program then calculates the bets for each outcome by dividing the LCM by the respective multiplier `k_i`. This ensures that if the i-th outcome wins, the amount received (`k_i * bet_i`) is exactly the LCM.
   - The sum of all these bets is stored in `sumo`.

4. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - The program checks if `sumo` (the total amount bet) is less than the LCM. If `sumo` is not less than the LCM, it prints `-1` indicating that no valid distribution of bets exists.
   - If `sumo` is less than the LCM, it prints the calculated bets.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **LCM Calculation**:
  - The LCM is calculated correctly using the GCD. This ensures that the amount received for any winning outcome is at least the LCM.
  
- **Bet Calculation**:
  - The bets are calculated as `LCM / k_i`, which ensures that `k_i * bet_i = LCM` for each outcome. This guarantees that the amount received for any winning outcome is exactly the LCM.
  
- **Feasibility Check**:
  - The program checks if the sum of the bets is less than the LCM. If it is, the distribution is valid because the amount received for any winning outcome (which is the LCM) is strictly greater than the total amount bet.
  
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles cases where no valid distribution exists by printing `-1`.
  - The constraints are respected, and the program can handle up to 10,000 test cases with up to 50 outcomes each.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find a valid distribution of bets or determine that no such distribution exists. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
