Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 50, followed by a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n where 2 <= k_i <= 20 for each i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the integer input, but no other variables are affected. The preconditions for the test cases and the constraints remain unchanged.
