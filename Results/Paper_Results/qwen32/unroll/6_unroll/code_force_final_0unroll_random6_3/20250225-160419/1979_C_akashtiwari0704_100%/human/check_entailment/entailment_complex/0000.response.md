### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine a way to distribute bets on outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. This is achieved by leveraging the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Handling:** The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.

2. **LCM Calculation:** The least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers is calculated. This LCM is used to determine the bets in a way that ensures the conditions are met.

3. **Bet Calculation:** For each outcome, the bet is calculated as `prod // k_i` where `prod` is the LCM. This ensures that the total sum of bets is less than the LCM.

4. **Condition Check:** The program checks if the total sum of the bets is less than the LCM. If it is, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **LCM Usage:** The LCM is used to ensure that the bets satisfy the condition. By setting each bet to `prod // k_i`, the total sum of bets is guaranteed to be less than the LCM because the sum of these fractions (each being less than 1 when considered as `k_i / prod`) adds up to less than 1 when multiplied by `prod`.

- **Output:** If the total sum of bets is less than the LCM, the bets are printed. Otherwise, `-1` is printed, indicating that no valid distribution of bets is possible.

- **Edge Cases:** The program handles edge cases such as when all multipliers are the same, or when the number of outcomes is minimal or maximal within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets based on the LCM of the multipliers and checks the condition to ensure the bets meet the required criteria. Therefore, the program is correct.
