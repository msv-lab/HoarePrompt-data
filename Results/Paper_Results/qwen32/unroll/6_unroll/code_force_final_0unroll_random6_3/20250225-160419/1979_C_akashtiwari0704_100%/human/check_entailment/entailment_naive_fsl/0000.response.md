Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the bets for each outcome such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers and then assigns bets based on the LCM divided by each multiplier. However, this approach does not guarantee that the total amount of coins bet will be strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. Specifically, the condition `if sumo >= prod` only checks if the sum of the bets is greater than or equal to the LCM, but it does not ensure that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the amount received for any individual winning outcome.

Here is a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
3
2 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 1 1
```
or any other valid distribution where the total bet is less than 4 (e.g., `1 1 1`, `2 1 1`, etc.).

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
-1
```

Explanation of the Counterexample:
- The LCM of `[2, 2, 2]` is `2`.
- The bets calculated by the program are `[1, 1, 1]` (since `2 // 2 = 1` for each multiplier).
- The sum of the bets is `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`, which is less than `2 * 1 = 2` for any winning outcome, but the program incorrectly outputs `-1` because `sumo` (3) is not less than `prod` (2).

Thus, the program does not handle this case correctly and is therefore incorrect.
