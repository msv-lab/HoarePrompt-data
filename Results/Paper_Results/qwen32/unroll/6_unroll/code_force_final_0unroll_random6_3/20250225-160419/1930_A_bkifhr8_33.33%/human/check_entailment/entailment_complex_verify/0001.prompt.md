You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = l.split(' ')
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of pairs of integers on the whiteboard. The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) representing the numbers written on the whiteboard. The input starts with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) indicating the number of test cases.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        
        n = int(input())
        
        l = input()

                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break
        
        ans_f.append(ans)
        
    #State: `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimums of the pairs for each test case.
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
        
    #State: Each element in the list `ans_f` is printed on a new line. The state of `ans_f` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a number of pairs of integers. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the minimum values from each pair and prints the result for each test case on a new line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of pairs of integers on the whiteboard) and the list of integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the final score.
   - The list of integers `lst` is obtained by splitting the input string.

3. **Calculating the Score:**
   - The program is supposed to perform `n` moves, each time choosing two integers `x` and `y`, adding `min(x, y)` to the score, and removing these integers from the list.
   - The loop runs `n * 2` times, which is incorrect. It should run `n` times because we are performing `n` moves, not `2n` operations.
   - Inside the loop, the program checks if the length of `lst` is not 2. However, this condition is not necessary and is incorrectly implemented. It attempts to remove elements at indices `0 * 2` and `1 * 2`, which will always be 0 and 2 respectively, leading to incorrect behavior.
   - If the length of `lst` is 2, it adds the minimum of the two remaining integers to `ans` and breaks the loop. This is the correct behavior for the last move, but it's not correctly integrated into the main loop.

4. **Storing and Printing Results:**
   - After processing each test case, the final score `ans` is appended to the list `ans_f`.
   - Finally, the program prints all the scores stored in `ans_f`.

### Correctness:

The current implementation has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

- The loop should run `n` times, not `n * 2` times.
- The logic for removing elements from the list is incorrect and can lead to index errors or incorrect results.
- The condition to handle the last two elements is not correctly integrated into the main loop.

### Correct Implementation:

To fix the issues, we need to ensure that we correctly perform `n` moves, always choosing the two smallest elements and adding the smaller one to the score. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lst.sort()
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            ans += lst[i]
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above.

**Correctness: False**
