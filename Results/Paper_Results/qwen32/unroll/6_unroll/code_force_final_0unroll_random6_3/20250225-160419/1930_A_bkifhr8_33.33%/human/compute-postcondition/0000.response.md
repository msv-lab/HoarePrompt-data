Output State: **`t` is an input integer, each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of pairs of integers on the whiteboard. The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) representing the numbers written on the whiteboard. The input starts with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) indicating the number of test cases.**

In this output state, `t` has been assigned the value of the input integer, while the description of the test cases and their structure remains unchanged as it is part of the precondition and has not been altered by the code snippet provided.
