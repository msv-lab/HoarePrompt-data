Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of pairs of integers on the whiteboard) and the list of integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the final score.
   - The list of integers `lst` is obtained by splitting the input string.

3. **Calculating the Score:**
   - The program is supposed to perform `n` moves, each time choosing two integers `x` and `y`, adding `min(x, y)` to the score, and removing these integers from the list.
   - The loop runs `n * 2` times, which is incorrect. It should run `n` times because we are performing `n` moves, not `2n` operations.
   - Inside the loop, the program checks if the length of `lst` is not 2. However, this condition is not necessary and is incorrectly implemented. It attempts to remove elements at indices `0 * 2` and `1 * 2`, which will always be 0 and 2 respectively, leading to incorrect behavior.
   - If the length of `lst` is 2, it adds the minimum of the two remaining integers to `ans` and breaks the loop. This is the correct behavior for the last move, but it's not correctly integrated into the main loop.

4. **Storing and Printing Results:**
   - After processing each test case, the final score `ans` is appended to the list `ans_f`.
   - Finally, the program prints all the scores stored in `ans_f`.

### Correctness:

The current implementation has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

- The loop should run `n` times, not `n * 2` times.
- The logic for removing elements from the list is incorrect and can lead to index errors or incorrect results.
- The condition to handle the last two elements is not correctly integrated into the main loop.

### Correct Implementation:

To fix the issues, we need to ensure that we correctly perform `n` moves, always choosing the two smallest elements and adding the smaller one to the score. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lst.sort()
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            ans += lst[i]
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above.

**Correctness: False**
