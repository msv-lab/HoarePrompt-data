Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes two integers `x` and `y` provided as input, where each integer consists only of digits from 1 to 9. It rearranges the digits of these numbers such that in the first half of each number, the larger digits from the corresponding positions of the original numbers are placed, and in the second half, the smaller digits are placed. It then prints the rearranged first number followed by the rearranged second number.**
