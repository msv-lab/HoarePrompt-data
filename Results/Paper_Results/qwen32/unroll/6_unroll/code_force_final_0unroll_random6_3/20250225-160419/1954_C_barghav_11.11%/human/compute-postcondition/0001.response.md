Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x < 10^100 and 1 <= y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9. `a` is a list of characters read from the input. `b` is a list of characters read from the input.**

In this output state, the variable `b` has been assigned a new value, which is a list of characters read from the input. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `a` remain unchanged.
