You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases and potential scenarios as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code and identify a case where it fails.

The program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the array is already uniform, and if not, it tries to find the longest sequence of identical elements from the start and end of the array. It then calculates the minimum number of burles needed by considering the longest sequence of identical elements.

However, the logic is flawed because it does not consider all possible ways to make the entire array uniform with a single operation. Specifically, the program does not account for the possibility of selecting a subarray in the middle of the array that could make the entire array uniform with fewer burles than the approach used in the code.

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
To make all elements of the array equal, we can select the subarray from index 2 to 4 (1-based indexing) and set all elements in this subarray to 1. This operation costs 3 burles, but we can do better. Instead, we can select the subarray from index 1 to 3 and set all elements to 1, or select the subarray from index 3 to 5 and set all elements to 1. Both operations cost 3 burles, but we can also select the subarray from index 2 to 3 and set all elements to 1, or select the subarray from index 3 to 4 and set all elements to 1, both of which cost 2 burles. Therefore, the minimum number of burles needed is 2.

However, the provided program would output 3 for this input, as it only considers the longest sequence of identical elements from the start and end of the array.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all cases optimally.
