To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand the logic of the provided code. The code processes `t` test cases, each with a list of integers `a` of length `n`. For each test case, it checks if all elements in the list are the same. If they are, it prints `0`. If not, it calculates the maximum number of consecutive elements that are the same from the start and the end of the list, and then prints `n - max(cn, ck)`.

Given the initial state, we will analyze the loop's behavior and derive the final state after all iterations.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` is the length of the list `num`.
   - `num` is the list of integers.

2. **Checking if all elements are the same:**
   - If all elements in `num` are the same, it prints `0` and moves to the next test case.

3. **Calculating `cn` and `ck`:**
   - `cn` is the count of consecutive elements from the start of `num` that are the same.
   - `ck` is the count of consecutive elements from the end of `num` that are the same.
   - If the first and last elements are the same, `cn` and `ck` are combined.

4. **Output:**
   - The output for each test case is `n - max(cn, ck)`.

### Output State:
After all iterations, the state of the variables in the loop body will be reset for each test case, but the final output will be a series of integers, one for each test case, based on the described logic.

Since the output is a series of integers (one per test case), we can describe the final output state as a list of these integers. However, the problem asks for the state in a specific format, and since we are not given specific values for `t`, `n`, and `a`, we can describe the output state in a general form.

Output State: **A series of integers, one for each test case, representing the output of the code for that test case.**

To provide a more concrete example, let's assume the following input:
- `t = 2`
- For the first test case: `n = 5`, `num = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
- For the second test case: `n = 5`, `num = [1, 2, 2, 2, 1]`

The output for the first test case would be `0` because all elements are the same.
The output for the second test case would be `2` because `cn = 1` and `ck = 2`, and `n - max(cn, ck) = 5 - 2 = 3`.

Thus, the output state would be:
Output State: **0 3**

However, since we are not given specific values, the general form is:
Output State: **A series of integers, one for each test case, representing the output of the code for that test case.**
