You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    -3 -2 3 4 5
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

    #State: For each test case, the output will be either 'YES' or 'NO' printed to the console, indicating whether it is possible to defeat all monsters with the given constraints. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `x`, `monsters`, `bullets_used`, and `can_survive` will not retain their values after the loop completes as they are local to each iteration. The state of `t` remains unchanged as it is the number of test cases to be processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each involving a set of monsters with specific health values and positions, and a given number of bullets. For each test case, it determines whether it is possible to defeat all monsters using the bullets, considering the distance each monster is from the starting point and a given parameter `k` that affects the number of bullets needed per unit distance. The function outputs 'YES' if all monsters can be defeated and 'NO' otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided Python program and determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of monsters) and `k` (maximum bullets per second).
   - It then reads the list `a` of monster healths and the list `x` of monster positions.
   - It pairs each monster's position with its health using `zip(x, a)` and sorts these pairs based on the absolute value of the positions (`abs(p[0])`).

2. **Logic to Determine Survival:**
   - The program initializes `bullets_used` to 0 and `can_survive` to `True`.
   - It then iterates over the sorted list of monsters.
   - For each monster, it calculates the distance from the character (`distance = abs(pos)`).
   - It calculates the total bullets needed up to this point (`total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health`).
   - It checks if the total bullets needed can be fired within the time it takes for the monster to reach the character (`distance * k`). If not, it sets `can_survive` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without setting `can_survive` to `False`, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Sorting by Distance:** The sorting step ensures that the program considers the closest monsters first. This is crucial because closer monsters pose an immediate threat and need to be dealt with first.
- **Bullet Calculation:** The program correctly calculates the total bullets needed and checks if it is feasible to kill each monster before it reaches the character.
- **Edge Cases:** The program handles cases where the number of bullets `k` is very large by simply checking if the total bullets needed can be fired within the time constraint. This is efficient and correct.

### Conclusion:

The program follows the correct logic to determine if the character can survive and kill all the monsters. It efficiently handles the constraints and correctly implements the required checks.
