Postcondition: **`nums` is a list of 1s with the same length as the initial `nums`, `ls` is the sum of the original `nums` list, `nw` is `True`, and `cw` is `False`.**

Given the precondition and the logical impossibility of the if condition being true, the else part will always execute, maintaining the state of `nums`, `ls`, `nw`, and `cw` as described.
