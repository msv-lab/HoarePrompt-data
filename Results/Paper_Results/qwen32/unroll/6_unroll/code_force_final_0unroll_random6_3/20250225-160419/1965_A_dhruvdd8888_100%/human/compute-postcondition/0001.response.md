The code snippet `nums = set(input().split())` takes an input, splits it into a list of strings, and then converts that list into a set. This means `nums` will be a set containing unique elements from the input. The variables `N`, `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged unless they are part of the input being split and converted into `nums`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain as described in the initial state; `nums` is a set of unique strings from the input.**
