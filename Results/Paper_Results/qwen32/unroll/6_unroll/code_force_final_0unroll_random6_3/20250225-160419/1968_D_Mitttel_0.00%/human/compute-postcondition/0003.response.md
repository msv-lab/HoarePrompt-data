Output State: **`start_pos` is an integer representing the starting position in the permutation, 1 <= `start_pos` <= n; `score` is 0; `current_pos` is equal to `start_pos`; `steps` is 0; `visited` is an empty dictionary.**

The code snippet initializes an empty dictionary named `visited`, while the values of `start_pos`, `score`, `current_pos`, and `steps` remain unchanged.
