Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^3.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of an input integer, which is expected to be between 1 and 1000, inclusive. The other conditions regarding `n` and `k` for each test case remain unchanged as they were part of the precondition and not directly affected by the execution of the given code snippet.
