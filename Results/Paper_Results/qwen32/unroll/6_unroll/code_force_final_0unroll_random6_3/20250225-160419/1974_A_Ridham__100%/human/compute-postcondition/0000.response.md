Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. The input is read from standard input and consists of t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) test cases. Each test case contains two integers x and y (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99) representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons, respectively.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of the first integer read from standard input, which specifies the number of test cases. The other details about the test cases (the values of `x` and `y` for each test case) are not yet read or processed.
