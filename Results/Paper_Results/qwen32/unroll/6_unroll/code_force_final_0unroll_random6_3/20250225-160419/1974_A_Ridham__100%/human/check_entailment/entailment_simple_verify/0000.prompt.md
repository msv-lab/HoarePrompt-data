You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 icons `x` and the number of 2x2 icons `y`.

2. **Space Calculation:**
   - `space_x` is calculated as `x * 1` which is simply `x`.
   - `space_y` is calculated as `y * 4` because each 2x2 icon requires 4 cells.
   - `total_space` is the sum of `space_x` and `space_y`.

3. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons:**
   - If `y` (number of 2x2 icons) is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2` because each screen can hold two 2x2 icons.
   - If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1` because one screen will have only one 2x2 icon.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation:**
   - `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. This represents the leftover cells after placing the 2x2 icons on the screens.

5. **Screen Calculation for 1x1 Icons:**
   - If `space_x` (number of 1x1 icons) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, no additional screens are needed for 1x1 icons.
   - Otherwise, the extra space needed for 1x1 icons is `space_x - remaining_cells`.
   - The number of extra screens required for 1x1 icons is calculated based on whether the extra space is a multiple of 15 or not.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Potential Issues

Let's consider the following test case:
- `x = 12`, `y = 3`
- The program will calculate:
  - `space_x = 12`
  - `space_y = 12`
  - `total_space = 24`
  - `screen_require_for_y = 2` (since `y` is odd, `3 // 2 + 1`)
  - `remaining_cells = 15 * 2 - 12 = 18`
  - Since `space_x` (12) is less than `remaining_cells` (18), no additional screens are needed for 1x1 icons.
  - Total screens = `2`

However, let's check if this is optimal:
- We can place 2 2x2 icons on the first screen, using up 8 cells and leaving 7 cells.
- We can place 2 2x2 icons on the second screen, using up 8 cells and leaving 7 cells.
- We can place 6 1x1 icons on the first screen (leaving 1 cell unused) and 6 1x1 icons on the second screen (leaving 1 cell unused).

This arrangement uses only 2 screens, which matches the program's output. However, let's consider another case:
- `x = 14`, `y = 2`
- The program will calculate:
  - `space_x = 14`
  - `space_y = 8`
  - `total_space = 22`
  - `screen_require_for_y = 1` (since `y` is even, `2 // 2`)
  - `remaining_cells = 15 * 1 - 8 = 7`
  - Since `space_x` (14) is greater than `remaining_cells` (7), we need additional screens for 1x1 icons.
  - Extra space needed = `14 - 7 = 7`
  - Extra screens required = `7 // 15 + 1 = 1` (since 7 is not a multiple of 15)
  - Total screens = `1 + 1 = 2`

However, let's check if this is optimal:
- We can place 2 2x2 icons on the first screen, using up 8 cells and leaving 7 cells.
- We can place 7 1x1 icons on the first screen (leaving 1 cell unused).
- We can place 7 1x1 icons on the second screen (leaving 8 cells unused).

This arrangement uses only 2 screens, which matches the program's output. However, let's consider another edge case:
- `x = 1`, `y = 3`
- The program will calculate:
  - `space_x = 1`
  - `space_y = 12`
  - `total_space = 13`
  - `screen_require_for_y = 2` (since `y` is odd, `3 // 2 + 1`)
  - `remaining_cells = 15 * 2 - 12 = 18`
  - Since `space_x` (1) is less than `remaining_cells` (18), no additional screens are needed for 1x1 icons.
  - Total screens = `2`

However, let's check if this is optimal:
- We can place 2 2x2 icons on the first screen, using up 8 cells and leaving 7 cells.
- We can place 1 2x2 icon on the second screen, using up 4 cells and leaving 11 cells.
- We can place 1 1x1 icon on the second screen (leaving 10 cells unused).

This arrangement uses only 2 screens, which matches the program's output. However, let's consider another edge case:
- `x = 14`, `y = 2`
- The program will calculate:
  - `space_x = 14`
  - `space_y = 8`
  - `total_space = 22`
  - `screen_require_for_y = 1` (since `y` is even, `2 // 2`)
  - `remaining_cells = 15 * 1 - 8 = 7`
  - Since `space_x` (14) is greater than `remaining_cells` (7), we need additional screens for 1x1 icons.
  - Extra space needed = `14 - 7 = 7`
  - Extra screens required = `7 // 15 + 1 = 1` (since 7 is not a multiple of 15)
  - Total screens = `1 + 1 = 2`

However, let's check if this is optimal:
- We can place 2 2x2 icons on the first screen, using up 8 cells and leaving 7 cells.
- We can place 7 1x1 icons on the first screen (leaving 1 cell unused).
- We can place 7 1x1 icons on the second screen (leaving 8 cells unused).

This arrangement uses only 2 screens, which matches the program's output.
