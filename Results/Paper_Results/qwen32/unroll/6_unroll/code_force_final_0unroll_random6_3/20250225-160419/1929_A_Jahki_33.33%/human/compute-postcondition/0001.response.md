To determine the state necessary for the for loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head, which are `i`, `1`, and `num2`. The loop will execute if the range `(1, num2)` contains at least one value, meaning `num2` must be greater than 1.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop starts with `i = 1` and continues as long as `i` is less than `num2`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `num2` must be greater than 1.
3. The initial state of `a` and `order` do not affect the execution of the loop directly, but they are part of the state provided, so we need to ensure they are consistent with the given conditions.

Given these points, the state should be adjusted to ensure `num2` is greater than 1. Since `num2` is equal to `len(a)`, we need to ensure `len(a)` is greater than 1. The initial state already specifies that `2 <= len(a) <= 100`, so no further adjustment to `a` is necessary in terms of the loop's execution.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each element a_i in a; `num2` is equal to len(a) and must be greater than 1; `order` is 0; `i` is 1**.

However, since `num2` being greater than 1 is already implied by the condition `2 <= len(a) <= 100`, we can simplify the state to:

State: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each element a_i in a; `num2` is equal to len(a); `order` is 0**.
