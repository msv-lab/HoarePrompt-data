### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies a significant issue with the program. The function `func_1` is unnecessary and incorrectly used to determine whether to print 0 or the calculated beauty. The beauty of the array should always be calculated based on the sorted order of the array, regardless of its initial configuration. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The program sorts the array in ascending order, which is the correct approach to maximize the beauty since the beauty is the sum of differences between consecutive elements, and sorting maximizes these differences.

2. **Calculating Beauty**: The program correctly calculates the beauty by iterating over the sorted array and summing the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Condition to Print 0**: The program uses `func_1` to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, the program prints 0. This condition is incorrect because even if the array is not sorted, the beauty can still be maximized by sorting it. Therefore, the beauty should always be calculated and printed.

4. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if the array is strictly increasing. However, the program incorrectly uses this function to decide whether to print 0 or the calculated beauty. The function is unnecessary and should be removed.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the following input:
```
2
3
1 3 2
3
2 1 3
```
- For the first test case, the array `[1, 3, 2]` is not sorted, but the beauty can still be calculated as `2` by sorting it to `[1, 2, 3]`.
- For the second test case, the array `[2, 1, 3]` is not sorted, but the beauty can be calculated as `2` by sorting it to `[1, 2, 3]`.
- The program will incorrectly print `0` for the first test case because `func_1` returns `False`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the unnecessary and incorrect use of the `func_1` function to decide whether to print 0 or the calculated beauty. The beauty should always be calculated and printed based on the sorted order of the array.

### Final: **False**
