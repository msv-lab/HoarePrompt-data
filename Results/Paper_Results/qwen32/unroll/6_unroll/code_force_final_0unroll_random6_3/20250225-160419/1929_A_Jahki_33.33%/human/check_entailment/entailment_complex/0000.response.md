### Reasoning:

The task is to determine the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, the array should be sorted in ascending order. This is because the difference between consecutive elements in a sorted array will be maximized, leading to the highest possible sum of these differences.

The provided program follows this logic correctly:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array.
3. It checks if the array is already strictly increasing using the `func_1` function. If it is, the beauty is 0 because rearranging won't increase the beauty.
4. If the array is not strictly increasing, it sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
5. It prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

The `func_1` function correctly checks if the array is strictly increasing by counting non-increasing consecutive pairs. If there are no such pairs, the array is strictly increasing, and the function returns `True`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by rearranging its elements. Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
