Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
The problem asks to find the maximum beauty of an array after rearranging its elements. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. The goal is to maximize this sum.

### Key Observations:
- The maximum beauty can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order. This is because the difference between consecutive elements will be maximized when the elements are in increasing order.
- If the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, the beauty is simply the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
- If the array is not sorted, sorting it will yield the maximum beauty.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The program sorts the array in ascending order using `sorted(a)`. This step is correct as it ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

3. **Calculating Beauty:**
   - The program calculates the beauty by iterating through the sorted array and summing up the differences between consecutive elements. This is the correct approach to calculate the beauty of the array.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program includes a function `func_1` to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. However, this function is not necessary for calculating the maximum beauty since sorting the array will always yield the correct result regardless of its initial order.
   - The function `func_1` is used to print `0` if the array is already sorted. However, this is incorrect because the beauty of an already sorted array should be calculated as described above, not simply `0`.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly sorts the array and calculates the beauty, but the inclusion of the `func_1` function and its usage to print `0` for already sorted arrays is incorrect.
- The program should be modified to remove the unnecessary function and directly calculate the beauty for all cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
