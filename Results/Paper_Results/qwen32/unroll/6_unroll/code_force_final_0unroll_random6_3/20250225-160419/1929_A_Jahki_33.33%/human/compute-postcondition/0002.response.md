To determine the output state, we need to analyze the loop and how it modifies the `order` variable based on the initial state provided.

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = num2 - 1` (which is equivalent to `len(a) - 1`). In each iteration, it checks whether the previous element (`a[i - 1]`) is greater than or equal to the current element (`a[i]`). If this condition is true, it increments the `order` variable by 1.

The `order` variable keeps track of the number of times an element in the list `a` is greater than or equal to the following element. Essentially, it counts the number of non-increasing consecutive pairs in the list.

Given that the initial state of `order` is 0, the final value of `order` will be the count of such non-increasing pairs after the loop completes all iterations.

The list `a` and the variable `num2` remain unchanged throughout the loop.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each element a_i in a; `num2` is equal to len(a); `order` is the number of non-increasing consecutive pairs in the list a.**
