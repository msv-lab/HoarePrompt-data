You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
    if order == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` checks if the list `a` of integers is strictly increasing. It returns `True` if the list is strictly increasing, meaning each element is greater than the previous one, and `False` otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
The problem asks to find the maximum beauty of an array after rearranging its elements. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. The goal is to maximize this sum.

### Key Observations:
- The maximum beauty can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order. This is because the difference between consecutive elements will be maximized when the elements are in increasing order.
- If the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, the beauty is simply the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
- If the array is not sorted, sorting it will yield the maximum beauty.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The program sorts the array in ascending order using `sorted(a)`. This step is correct as it ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

3. **Calculating Beauty:**
   - The program calculates the beauty by iterating through the sorted array and summing up the differences between consecutive elements. This is the correct approach to calculate the beauty of the array.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program includes a function `func_1` to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. However, this function is not necessary for calculating the maximum beauty since sorting the array will always yield the correct result regardless of its initial order.
   - The function `func_1` is used to print `0` if the array is already sorted. However, this is incorrect because the beauty of an already sorted array should be calculated as described above, not simply `0`.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly sorts the array and calculates the beauty, but the inclusion of the `func_1` function and its usage to print `0` for already sorted arrays is incorrect.
- The program should be modified to remove the unnecessary function and directly calculate the beauty for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
