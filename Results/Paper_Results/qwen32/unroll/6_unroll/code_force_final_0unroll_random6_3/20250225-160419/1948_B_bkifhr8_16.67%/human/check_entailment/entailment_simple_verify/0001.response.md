### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several key issues with the provided program. Here's a detailed breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), the length of each array (`n`), and the elements of the array (`list1`).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program iterates through the array starting from the second element and checks if the current element is greater than the previous one and if the previous one is at least 10.
   - If the condition is met, it splits the previous element into its constituent digits and inserts them back into the array at the same position.
   - However, this logic only processes the array once. After splitting an element, the newly inserted elements might need further processing to ensure the array is sorted. The current loop does not account for this, leading to potential incorrect results.

3. **Checking if the Array is Sorted:**
   - The program uses a helper function `func_1` to check if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. This function correctly compares the array with its sorted version and returns `True` if they are the same, indicating the array is sorted.

4. **Output:**
   - Based on the result from `func_1`, the program prints "Yes" or "No". However, since the array might not be fully processed before this check, the output could be incorrect.

### Issues and Corrections:
- **Logic for Splitting Elements:**
  - The program only checks and splits elements once per test case. This is insufficient because splitting an element can affect subsequent elements that need to be checked.
  - A nested loop or a while loop is required to keep processing the array until no more splits are needed and the array is sorted.

### Correctness of the Program:
Given the above points, the current program is not guaranteed to work correctly for all cases because it does not ensure that the array is fully processed after splitting elements. It might miss cases where further splits are required to achieve a sorted array.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the program is incorrect due to the insufficient processing of the array after splitting elements. The program does not account for the need to repeatedly process the array to ensure it is sorted.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
