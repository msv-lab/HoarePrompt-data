### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to determine whether it is possible to sort the given array using the specified operation. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.

2. **Transformation Attempt:**
   - The program iterates through the array from the second element to the end.
   - If the current element is smaller than the previous one and the previous one is at least 10, it attempts to split the previous element into its constituent digits.
   - This is done by popping the previous element and inserting its tens and units digits in their respective positions.

3. **Check Sorted State:**
   - After attempting the transformation, the program checks if the array is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version using the `func_1` function.
   - If the array is sorted, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Issues in the Program:

- **Single Pass Limitation:**
  - The current implementation only performs one pass through the array to attempt transformations.
  - This might not be sufficient because the transformation of an element can affect subsequent elements, and multiple passes might be necessary to fully sort the array.

- **Inefficient Transformation Handling:**
  - The transformation is only attempted if the previous element is greater than the current one and is at least 10.
  - This condition is too restrictive and might miss opportunities to sort the array, especially if the array needs multiple transformations.

### Correctness:

Given the above issues, the program might not correctly determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operations. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to be correct for all possible inputs.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **False**
