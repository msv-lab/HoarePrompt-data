You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
            a = list1[p - 1]
            list1.pop(p - 1)
            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Function Summary: 
The function checks if the input list `lst` of integers (where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive and the length of the list is between 2 and 50 inclusive) is already sorted in ascending order. It returns `True` if the list is sorted; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the provided Python program is correct based on the problem description, we need to analyze several aspects of the code:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`list1`).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element is greater than the previous one and the previous one is at least 10, it splits the previous element into its constituent digits and inserts them back into the array at the same position.

3. **Checking if the Array is Sorted:**
   - After processing, the program uses a helper function `func_1` to check if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - The helper function `func_1` compares the array with its sorted version and returns `True` if they are the same, indicating the array is sorted.

4. **Output:**
   - Based on the result from `func_1`, the program prints "Yes" or "No".

### Issues and Corrections:
1. **Logic for Splitting Elements:**
   - The current logic for splitting elements only checks the immediate previous element. However, after splitting, the newly inserted elements might need further processing to ensure the array is sorted.
   - The current loop only runs once per test case, which is insufficient because splitting an element can affect subsequent elements that need to be checked.

2. **Helper Function:**
   - The helper function `func_1` is correctly checking if the array is sorted, but the main logic needs to ensure that the array is fully processed before this check.

3. **Loop for Splitting:**
   - A nested loop or a while loop might be required to keep processing the array until no more splits are needed and the array is sorted.

### Correctness of the Program:
Given the above points, the current program is not guaranteed to work correctly for all cases because it does not ensure that the array is fully processed after splitting elements. It might miss cases where further splits are required to achieve a sorted array.

### Conclusion:
The program as it stands is incorrect because it does not account for the need to repeatedly process the array after each split to ensure it is sorted.

Correctness: **False**
