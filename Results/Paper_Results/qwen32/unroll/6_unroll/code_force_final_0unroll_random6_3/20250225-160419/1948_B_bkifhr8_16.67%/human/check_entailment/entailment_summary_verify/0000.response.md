### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases for transforming the array into a sorted one using the allowed operations. Here's a detailed breakdown of why:

1. **Single Pass Limitation**: The program only makes a single pass through the array, checking each element against its previous one and splitting it if necessary. This approach is too simplistic because the transformation process can involve multiple iterations where elements need to be split and re-evaluated.

2. **Inadequate Handling of Multiple Splits**: The program does not account for the possibility that splitting an element might require further splits of subsequent elements to achieve a sorted array. The given example in the original assessment demonstrates this clearly:
   - **Input:** `1 4 12 30 4 5`
   - **Expected Output:** `YES` (can be transformed to `[1, 2, 3, 0, 4, 5]`)
   - **Actual Output:** `NO` (program only splits `30` into `3` and `0`, resulting in `[12, 3, 0, 4, 5]`, which is not sorted)

3. **Lack of Recursive or Iterative Re-evaluation**: After splitting an element, the program does not re-evaluate the entire array to ensure that further splits are necessary. This is crucial because splitting one element might unsort parts of the array that were previously in order.

4. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly checks if the list is sorted, but it is applied after a single pass through the array, which is insufficient to guarantee a sorted result.

### Conclusion:

The provided program is incorrect because it does not fully explore all possible transformations needed to sort the array. It needs a more robust approach that can handle multiple iterations and re-evaluations of the array after each split.

### Final: **False**
