To determine if the provided Python program is correct based on the problem description, we need to analyze several aspects of the code:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`list1`).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element is greater than the previous one and the previous one is at least 10, it splits the previous element into its constituent digits and inserts them back into the array at the same position.

3. **Checking if the Array is Sorted:**
   - After processing, the program uses a helper function `func_1` to check if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - The helper function `func_1` compares the array with its sorted version and returns `True` if they are the same, indicating the array is sorted.

4. **Output:**
   - Based on the result from `func_1`, the program prints "Yes" or "No".

### Issues and Corrections:
1. **Logic for Splitting Elements:**
   - The current logic for splitting elements only checks the immediate previous element. However, after splitting, the newly inserted elements might need further processing to ensure the array is sorted.
   - The current loop only runs once per test case, which is insufficient because splitting an element can affect subsequent elements that need to be checked.

2. **Helper Function:**
   - The helper function `func_1` is correctly checking if the array is sorted, but the main logic needs to ensure that the array is fully processed before this check.

3. **Loop for Splitting:**
   - A nested loop or a while loop might be required to keep processing the array until no more splits are needed and the array is sorted.

### Correctness of the Program:
Given the above points, the current program is not guaranteed to work correctly for all cases because it does not ensure that the array is fully processed after splitting elements. It might miss cases where further splits are required to achieve a sorted array.

### Conclusion:
The program as it stands is incorrect because it does not account for the need to repeatedly process the array after each split to ensure it is sorted.

Correctness: **False**
