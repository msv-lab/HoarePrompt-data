Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of characters to be removed to make the string beautiful. The approach of simply counting the occurrences of "map", "pie", and "mapie" and then calculating `x + y - z` does not account for overlapping substrings or the optimal way to remove characters to break all occurrences of "map" and "pie".

For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
8
mapmapie
```

The string "mapmapie" contains two occurrences of "map" and one occurrence of "pie". However, the optimal way to make the string beautiful is to remove just 2 characters (e.g., the first 'm' and the last 'e'), resulting in "apmaapi", which does not contain "map" or "pie". The program would incorrectly output `2 + 1 - 1 = 2`, which is correct in this case, but the method is flawed and may not work for other cases.

Let's consider another test case:

Input:
```
1
10
mapiepie
```

The string "mapiepie" contains one occurrence of "map" and two occurrences of "pie". The optimal way to make the string beautiful is to remove just 2 characters (e.g., the first 'm' and the last 'e'), resulting in "apiepie", which does not contain "map" or "pie". The program would output `1 + 2 - 0 = 3`, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
