Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

Let's analyze the provided code and see if it meets the problem description.

The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. However, there are a few issues with the logic and the way the operations are constructed.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - This function is supposed to find the subarray `[l, r]` that maximizes the sum after replacing the subarray with its MEX value.
    - The current implementation calculates the sum as `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`. This formula is incorrect because it doesn't actually compute the MEX value of the subarray.
    - The MEX value should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, and the sum should be recalculated based on this MEX value, not `(j - i + 1) ** 2`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
    - This function is supposed to construct the sequence of operations to set all elements in the subarray to the MEX value.
    - The current implementation is recursive and doesn't correctly handle the operations. It seems to be trying to set the subarray elements to the MEX value but in a way that doesn't match the problem's requirements.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
    - This function is supposed to perform the operations and update the list.
    - The logic here is also incorrect. It appends operations and modifies the list but doesn't correctly calculate the MEX value or ensure the operations are minimal.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Let's consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```

The expected output is:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```

However, the provided code does not correctly calculate the MEX value and the operations. It might produce incorrect operations that do not maximize the sum or do not follow the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the MEX value for subarrays and does not construct the correct sequence of operations to maximize the sum of the array. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
