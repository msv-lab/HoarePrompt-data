### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to maximize the sum of an array by performing a series of operations where a subarray is replaced with its MEX (Minimum EXcluded Value). The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.

Let's analyze the provided code and its functions:

1. **Main Program:**
   - Reads the array `lst` from the input.
   - Initializes an empty list `ops` to store the operations.
   - Uses `func_1` to find the subarray `(r, l)` that maximizes the sum when replaced by its MEX.
   - Continues replacing subarrays until no further improvement is possible.
   - Attempts to replace any remaining `0`s with `1`s.
   - Prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Computes the sum of the array if a subarray from index `i` to `j` is replaced by its MEX.
   - Returns the indices `(r, l)` of the subarray that results in the maximum sum.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Recursively adds operations to `ops` to split the subarray `[r, l]` into smaller subarrays, which is not clearly utilized in the main program flow and seems redundant.

4. **Function `func_3`:**
   - Adds an operation to replace the subarray `[r, l]` with its MEX.
   - If the minimum value in the subarray is `0`, it adds another operation to replace the subarray `[r, l]` again.
   - Adds an operation to replace the single element at index `r`.
   - Calls `func_2` to add more operations, which is not necessary for the problem.
   - Replaces the subarray `[r, l]` with the MEX value repeated for the length of the subarray.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Approach:**
  - The main logic is to find a subarray that, when replaced by its MEX, maximizes the sum.
  - The function `func_1` correctly computes the potential maximum sum by iterating over all possible subarrays and calculating the sum if that subarray were replaced by its MEX.
  - The function `func_3` correctly performs the replacement operation and adds the necessary operations to the list `ops`.
  
- **Redundancies and Issues:**
  - The function `func_2` is unnecessary and does not contribute to the solution.
  - The repeated operations added by `func_3` when the minimum value in the subarray is `0` are unnecessary and do not improve the sum.
  - The attempt to replace remaining `0`s with `1`s is correct but not optimal as it should be handled within the main logic.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array but includes unnecessary operations and redundant function calls. However, the core logic for finding and replacing subarrays with their MEX is correct.

Correctness: **True**

The program is correct in terms of achieving the maximum sum, although there are opportunities for optimization and simplification.
