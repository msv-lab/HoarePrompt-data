The code snippet modifies the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` by replacing it with a list of `n` elements, where each element is the value of `n`. Since `n` is defined as `l - r + 1`, the sublist from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) is replaced with a sublist of the same length where each element is `n`.

Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), lst is a list of integers where the sublist from index `r` to `l` has been replaced with `[n for _ in range(n)]`, and ops is a list that now contains an additional element [r + 1, l + 1] making it have [r + 1, l + 1], [r + 1, r + 1], and [r + 1, l + 1]. The condition that the minimum value in the sublist lst[r:l + 1] is 0 is no longer valid since the sublist is now filled with the value `n`. `n` is `l - r + 1`.**
