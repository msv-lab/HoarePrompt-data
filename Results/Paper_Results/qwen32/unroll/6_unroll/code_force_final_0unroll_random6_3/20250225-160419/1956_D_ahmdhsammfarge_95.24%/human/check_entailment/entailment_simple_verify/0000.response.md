Let's systematically evaluate the provided program based on the problem description, the code, and the annotated version.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the sum of an array by repeatedly choosing a subarray, computing its MEX value, and replacing all elements in that subarray with the MEX value. The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

### Code Analysis

#### Function `func_1`

```python
def func_1(lst):
    r = l = 0
    over_sum = sum(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
            sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
            if sm > over_sum:
                (r, l) = [i, j]
                over_sum = sm
    return (r, l)
```

**Issue:**
- The function is trying to find the subarray `[l, r]` that maximizes the sum after replacement. However, it incorrectly calculates the new sum as `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`.
- The correct calculation should involve finding the MEX of the subarray `lst[i:j+1]` and then replacing the subarray elements with this MEX value to calculate the new sum.

#### Function `func_2`

```python
def func_2(r, l, ops: list):
    if r == l:
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
        return
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
```

**Issue:**
- This function is recursive and seems to be trying to construct a sequence of operations to set all elements in the subarray to the MEX value. However, the logic is incorrect and does not match the problem's requirements.

#### Function `func_3`

```python
def func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list):
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    if min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0:
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])
    func_2(r, l, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    n = l - r + 1
    lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]
    return lst
```

**Issue:**
- This function is supposed to perform the operations and update the list. However, the logic is incorrect. It appends operations and modifies the list but doesn't correctly calculate the MEX value or ensure the operations are minimal.

### Annotated Code Analysis

The annotated code provides insights into the state of the program at key points, but the annotations do not address the core issues with the logic of finding the MEX value and constructing the correct sequence of operations.

### Example Case Analysis

Let's consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```

The expected output is:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```

However, the provided code does not correctly calculate the MEX value and the operations. It might produce incorrect operations that do not maximize the sum or do not follow the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the MEX value for subarrays and does not construct the correct sequence of operations to maximize the sum of the array. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation

**Reasoning:** The program fails to correctly compute the MEX value for subarrays and does not generate the correct sequence of operations to maximize the sum of the array. The logic in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

**Final:** **False**
