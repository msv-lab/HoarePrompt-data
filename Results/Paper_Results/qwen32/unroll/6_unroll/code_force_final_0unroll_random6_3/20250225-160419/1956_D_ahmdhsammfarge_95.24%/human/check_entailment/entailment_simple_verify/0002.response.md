### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the analysis step-by-step using the annotated code and the problem description:

1. **Function 1: `func_1(lst)`**
   - **Objective**: Find the subarray `[i, j]` that maximizes the sum of the array after replacing it with its MEX.
   - **Current Implementation**: The function calculates a sum based on the length of the subarray and the sums of the parts of the array outside the subarray. However, it does not compute the MEX of the subarray and does not ensure that the chosen subarray maximizes the sum.
   - **Issue**: The logic for finding the optimal subarray is incorrect. The MEX operation is not considered, and the sum calculation is not relevant to the problem.

2. **Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`**
   - **Objective**: Add operations to the list `ops` recursively.
   - **Current Implementation**: The function adds operations with the same subarray bounds recursively without any meaningful impact on the array or the sum.
   - **Issue**: The function does not contribute to solving the problem correctly. It simply appends redundant operations to `ops`.

3. **Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`**
   - **Objective**: Perform the operation on the subarray `[r, l]` by replacing it with its MEX.
   - **Current Implementation**: The function replaces the subarray with the length of the subarray instead of its MEX. It also adds multiple operations to `ops` recursively.
   - **Issue**: The function does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray and adds redundant operations, which do not contribute to solving the problem correctly.

4. **Main Program Logic**
   - **Objective**: Maximize the sum of the array by performing the MEX operation on subarrays.
   - **Current Implementation**: The main program uses `func_1` to find subarrays and `func_3` to perform operations. However, both functions have issues as described above.
   - **Issue**: The main logic is flawed because it relies on incorrect functions to find the optimal subarray and perform the MEX operation.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The functions do not perform the intended operations, and the overall logic does not ensure that the sum of the array is maximized.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
