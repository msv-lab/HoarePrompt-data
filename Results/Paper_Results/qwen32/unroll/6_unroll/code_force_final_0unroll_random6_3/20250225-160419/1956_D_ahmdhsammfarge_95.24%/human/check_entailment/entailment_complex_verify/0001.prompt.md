You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

    #The program returns a tuple containing the starting index `r` and the ending index `l` of the subarray.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list of non-negative integers and returns a tuple containing the starting and ending indices of a subarray. The subarray is chosen such that a specific calculated sum involving the subarray is maximized.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function modifies the list `ops` by appending operations in the form of pairs `[r + 1, l + 1]` based on the initial values of `r` and `l` and recursively reduces `l` until `l` equals `r`. The function does not return any value.

    #The program returns the list `lst` where the sublist from index `r` to `l` has been replaced with `[n for _ in range(n)]`, and `n` is equal to `l - r + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function modifies the input list `lst` by replacing the sublist from index `r` to `l` with a new sublist containing `n` elements, each equal to `n`, where `n` is the length of the original sublist (`l - r + 1`). It also appends several operations to the `ops` list.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Breakdown:
The goal is to maximize the sum of an array by repeatedly performing an operation that replaces a subarray with its MEX (Minimum Excluded Value). The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set. The operations are constrained to be no more than 500,000.

### Program Analysis:

#### Function 1: `func_1(lst)`
This function is supposed to find the optimal subarray `[i, j]` to replace with its MEX. However, the current implementation does not accurately compute the MEX of the subarray, and it doesn't ensure that the chosen subarray maximizes the sum of the array after the operation. Instead, it calculates a sum based on the length of the subarray and the sums of the parts of the array outside the subarray, which is not the correct approach for finding the MEX or maximizing the sum.

#### Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`
This function seems to be intended to add operations to a list `ops` recursively, but it doesn't perform any meaningful operations related to maximizing the array sum. It simply adds operations with the same subarray bounds, which does not contribute to solving the problem correctly.

#### Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`
This function is supposed to perform the operation on the subarray `[r, l]` by replacing it with its MEX. However, it does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray. Instead, it replaces the subarray with the length of the subarray, which is not the correct MEX operation. Additionally, it adds multiple operations to `ops` recursively, which again does not contribute to solving the problem correctly.

### Correctness:
Given the analysis above, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the MEX of a subarray or to maximize the sum of the array. The functions do not perform the intended operations and instead perform unrelated or incorrect operations.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
