Reasoning:
The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each time input in the 24-hour format. It converts the hours appropriately to the 12-hour format and appends the correct AM/PM suffix. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program handles different cases:

1. If the hour `h` is 0, it correctly sets the hour to 12 and the day to 'AM'.
2. If the hour `h` is greater than 12, it correctly adjusts the hour by subtracting 12 and sets the day to 'PM'.
3. If the hour `h` is between 1 and 11, it sets the day to 'AM'.
4. If the hour `h` is 12, it correctly sets the day to 'PM' (since 12 PM is the correct representation for 12 in 24-hour format).

The program uses string formatting (`f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}'`) to ensure that the hour and minute are always displayed with two digits, which is crucial for maintaining the correct format as specified in the problem description.

The execution summary indicates that the function reads and processes each test case as expected, and the output matches the example provided in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
