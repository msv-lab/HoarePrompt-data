Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a logical error in determining whether the time is AM or PM. Specifically, the logic for the `day` variable is incorrect when `h` is 12. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

In the original code, if `h` is 12, it incorrectly sets `day` to 'AM'. The correct behavior is to set `day` to 'PM' when `h` is 12.
