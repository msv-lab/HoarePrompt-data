Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided does not handle the case where the hour is exactly 12 correctly. Specifically, the program should output "12:xx PM" for 12:xx in 24-hour format and "12:xx AM" for 00:xx in 24-hour format. However, the current implementation outputs "00:xx AM" for 00:xx in 24-hour format, which is incorrect.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Midnight (00:xx) should be "12:xx AM"**:
   - The current code sets `h = 12` and `day = 'AM'` for `h == 0`, which is correct.
   
2. **Noon (12:xx) should be "12:xx PM"**:
   - The current code sets `day = 'PM'` for `h > 12`, which is correct for hours 13-23.
   - However, for `h == 12`, the code incorrectly sets `day = 'PM'` and then changes it to `day = 'AM'`. This results in "12:xx AM" being printed instead of "12:xx PM".

To fix this, the code should directly handle the case for `h == 12` to ensure it is always set to "12:xx PM". Here is the corrected part of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        day = 'AM'
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

This ensures that "12:xx PM" is correctly printed for noon (12:xx in 24-hour format).
