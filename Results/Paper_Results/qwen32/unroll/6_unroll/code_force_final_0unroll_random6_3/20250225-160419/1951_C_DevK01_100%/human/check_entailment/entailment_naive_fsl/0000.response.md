Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase exactly k tickets given the constraints. The main issues are:

1. **Sorting the Prices**: The program sorts the prices in ascending order and then selects the smallest prices. However, this approach does not account for the price increase mechanism. If you buy tickets on a day, the prices for subsequent days increase by the number of tickets bought. Therefore, buying tickets on days with initially higher prices might sometimes be more cost-effective if it allows you to buy more tickets on subsequent days at increased prices.

2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation logic does not correctly account for the price increases. The program calculates the cost based on a fixed number of tickets bought each day without considering the price increases dynamically.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the number of tickets to be bought is exactly equal to the number of days or when the maximum number of tickets per day is very large.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

**Example:**
```
1
5 3 9
5 5 5 5 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
45
```

**Explanation:**
- You can buy 3 tickets on the first day for 15 (5 + 5 + 5).
- The prices for the remaining days will be [8, 8, 8, 8].
- You can buy 3 tickets on the second day for 24 (8 + 8 + 8).
- The prices for the remaining days will be [11, 11, 11].
- You can buy 3 tickets on the third day for 33 (11 + 11 + 11).
- The prices for the remaining days will be [14, 14].
- You can buy the last ticket on the fourth day for 14.

Total cost: 15 + 24 + 33 + 14 = 86 (this is not the minimum cost).

However, the optimal way is to buy:
- 3 tickets on the first day for 15 (5 + 5 + 5).
- 3 tickets on the second day for 24 (8 + 8 + 8).
- 3 tickets on the third day for 33 (11 + 11 + 11).

Total cost: 15 + 24 + 33 = 72.

The provided program will not yield the correct result for this case because it does not dynamically adjust the number of tickets bought each day based on the price increases.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
