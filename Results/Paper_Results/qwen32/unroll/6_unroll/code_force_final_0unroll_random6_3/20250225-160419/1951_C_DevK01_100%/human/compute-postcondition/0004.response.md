Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of sale days (`n`), the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased each day (`m`), and the total number of tickets to be bought (`k`). For each test case, it also receives a list of `n` integers representing the price per ticket for each day. The function calculates and prints the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets, considering the constraints provided.**
