Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, representing the number of sale days, the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased each day, and the total number of tickets to be bought, respectively. Additionally, each test case includes a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, where each integer represents the price per ticket for each of the upcoming `n` days. The function returns the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets, considering the constraints provided.**
