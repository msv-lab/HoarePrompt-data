Reasoning:  
The provided Python program does not correctly implement the algorithm to find the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets given the constraints. Here are the key issues with the current implementation:

1. **Sorting Prices**: The program sorts the list of ticket prices. However, this does not account for the fact that purchasing tickets on a particular day increases the price for all subsequent days. Sorting the prices does not provide the correct order to minimize the overall cost.

2. **Greedy Approach**: The program uses a greedy approach by purchasing tickets on the cheapest available days. However, this greedy strategy does not consider the incremental price increase for subsequent days. A more optimal strategy involves a dynamic programming or binary search approach to find the minimum cost.

3. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation in the program is incorrect. It assumes that purchasing tickets on the cheapest days and then applying a fixed formula for the incremental cost will yield the minimum total cost. This is not the case due to the dynamic price increase.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when the number of tickets `k` is not a multiple of `m` or when the number of days `n` is very large.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated algorithm is needed, such as binary search to find the minimum cost or dynamic programming to account for the price increases.

Correctness: **False**
