You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
import copy, math, random, decimal
from decimal import Decimal

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    (val, cnt) = (arr[0], 0)
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It checks if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs the length of the shortest sequence of consecutive elements that are equal in `arr`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. A beautiful array is defined as one where you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` (where `2 <= i <= |a| - 1`) with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`.

### Key Points:
1. **Identical Arrays**: If the array is already entirely composed of the same element, it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements, so the answer should be `-1`.
2. **Non-Identical Arrays**: For arrays that are not identical, we need to find the smallest contiguous segment of identical elements that, if removed, will make the array non-beautiful.

### Program Analysis:
The given program follows these steps:
1. **Check if the array is entirely identical**: It iterates through the array to see if all elements are the same. If they are, it sets `flag` to `True` and outputs `-1`.
2. **Find the smallest segment of identical elements**: It then iterates through the array again to find the smallest contiguous segment of identical elements and keeps track of the minimum length of such segments using the `ans` variable.
3. **Output the result**: If the array was entirely identical (`flag` is `True`), it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs the length of the smallest segment found (`ans`).

### Issues:
- **Logic for Identical Arrays**: The logic for checking if the array is entirely identical is correct.
- **Logic for Finding Smallest Segment**: The logic for finding the smallest segment of identical elements is flawed. The program does not correctly handle the requirement to make the array non-beautiful by removing a segment. The current implementation only finds the smallest contiguous segment of identical elements but does not ensure that removing this segment will make the array non-beautiful.

### Example:
For the input `7 3 3 3 5 3 3 3`, the program will output `3`, but this is incorrect because removing any segment of three `3`s will still leave a beautiful array. The correct approach would be to find and remove a segment that, when removed, will disrupt the ability to make all elements the same using the allowed operations.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. Therefore, it is incorrect.
