The provided code snippet is just a comment block with metadata about the script, and it does not contain any executable Python code. Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`) are affected by this snippet. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
