In the given task, the `while` loop condition is `while T:`. In Python, a non-zero integer is considered `True` in a boolean context. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `T` is not zero.

Given the initial state:
- `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9

Since `T` is already defined to be an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, it is guaranteed to be non-zero and thus the loop can certainly execute at least once.

No adjustments are needed for `T` because it is already in a state that allows the loop to execute. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`) are not part of the loop condition and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9**
