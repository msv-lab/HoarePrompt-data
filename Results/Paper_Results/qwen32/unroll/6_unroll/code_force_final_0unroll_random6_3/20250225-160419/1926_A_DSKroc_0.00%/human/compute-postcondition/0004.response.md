The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'A'`. The initial state describes the variables `ac` and `bc` which hold the counts of 'A's and 'B's in a string of length 5, with `ac` being greater than `bc`. However, these variables are not used in the provided code snippet.

Since the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `ac` or `bc`, the output will simply be the character `'A'`.

Output: **A**
