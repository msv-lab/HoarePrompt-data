You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
    if ac > bc:
        print('A')
    else:
        print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string of length 5 consisting only of 'A' and 'B'. It then prints 'A' if the string contains more 'A's than 'B's, otherwise it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The given program is intended to determine which letter ('A' or 'B') appears most frequently in each of the given strings. However, there are a few issues with the provided code that lead to incorrect behavior.

1. The program initializes `ac` (count of 'A') and `bc` (count of 'B') outside the loop that processes each test case. This means that the counts from one test case will carry over to the next, leading to incorrect results.
2. The `if ac > bc` comparison is also outside the loop, meaning it only checks the counts from the last test case, not each individual test case.
3. The program does not handle the case where both 'A' and 'B' appear with the same frequency, although the problem doesn't specify what to do in this case, it is still a potential issue if the requirement is to always return one of the characters.

To fix the program, we need to move the initialization of `ac` and `bc` inside the loop for each test case and also move the comparison and print statement inside the loop to process each test case independently.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        elif bc > ac:
            print('B')
        else:
            print('A')  # or print('B'), depending on the requirement for ties

# Example usage:
# func()
```

Correctness: **False**
