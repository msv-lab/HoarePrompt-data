You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
    if ac > bc:
        print('A')
    else:
        print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string of length 5 consisting only of 'A' and 'B'. It then prints 'A' if the string contains more 'A's than 'B's, otherwise it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description. Specifically, the program only compares the counts of 'A' and 'B' after processing all test cases, rather than comparing the counts for each individual test case. As a result, the output will only reflect the comparison of counts for the last test case, not the correct answer for each test case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')

```

In the corrected version, the comparison between `ac` and `bc` and the corresponding print statement are moved inside the loop that processes each test case. This ensures that the output for each test case is determined correctly and independently.
