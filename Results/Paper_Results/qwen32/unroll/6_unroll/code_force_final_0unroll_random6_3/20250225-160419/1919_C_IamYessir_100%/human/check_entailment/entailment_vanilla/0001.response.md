### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `lit` itself.

2. **Splitting Logic:**
   - The program initializes two empty lists `a` and `b` to represent the subsequences.
   - It iterates through each element of `lit` and attempts to place it in either `a` or `b` based on certain conditions.
   - The conditions for placing an element into `a` or `b` seem to be based on the last elements of `a` and `b` and the current element being processed.
   - The logic for splitting the array into two subsequences is not straightforward and does not clearly reflect an optimal way to minimize the penalty.

3. **Penalty Calculation:**
   - After splitting the array into `a` and `b`, the program calculates the penalty for each subsequence.
   - It counts the number of increasing pairs in `a` and `b` and sums these penalties.
   - The penalty is correctly calculated as the number of indices `i` where `b[i] < b[i + 1]`.

4. **Optimal Splitting:**
   - The problem requires finding the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.
   - The provided program does not guarantee an optimal split. It uses a heuristic-based approach rather than an algorithm that ensures the minimum penalty.

### Issues with the Provided Program:
- The program does not guarantee an optimal solution. The heuristic used for splitting the array into `a` and `b` does not necessarily minimize the penalty.
- A correct solution would involve finding a way to split the array such that the sum of penalties of the two subsequences is minimized. This is a more complex problem that may require dynamic programming or a different approach.

### Correctness:
Given the issues with the provided program, it does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
