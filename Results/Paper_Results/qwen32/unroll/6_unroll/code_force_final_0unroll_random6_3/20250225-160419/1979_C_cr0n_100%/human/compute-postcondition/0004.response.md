To determine the output state, we need to understand the behavior of the function `func_1`. However, the code snippet provided does not define `func_1`, so I'll assume a common operation that might be performed with multipliers, such as multiplication.

Let's assume `func_1(den, x)` performs the operation `den = den * x`.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer provided by the input.
- `vals` is a list of integers representing the multipliers.
- `den` is the first element of `vals`.

The loop iterates over each element `x` in `vals` and updates `den` by multiplying it with `x`.

Let's break down the loop:
1. Initialize `den` with the first element of `vals`.
2. For each `x` in `vals`, update `den` as `den = den * x`.

After the loop finishes, `den` will be the product of all elements in `vals`.

**Output State:**
- `N` remains unchanged.
- `vals` remains unchanged.
- `den` is the product of all elements in `vals`.

Output State: **`N` is the integer provided by the input, `vals` is a list of integers representing the multipliers, `den` is the product of all elements in `vals`.**
