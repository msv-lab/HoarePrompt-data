### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to distribute bets on `n` outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. Each winning outcome `i` has a multiplier `k_i` such that if outcome `i` wins, the bet on that outcome is multiplied by `k_i` to determine the payout.

#### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `N` and the list of multipliers `vals`.

2. **Calculating the Product of Multipliers:**
   - The function `func_2` computes the least common multiple (LCM) of all multipliers in `vals` using `func_1`. This is actually the product of all the multipliers because all multipliers are integers between 2 and 20, and their GCD is 1 when considered as a group (since they are not necessarily pairwise coprime but their product is used here).

3. **Generating Bets:**
   - `vprod` is a list where each element is the product of all multipliers divided by the corresponding multiplier `r` in `vals`. This means `vprod[i]` is the product of all multipliers except `vals[i]`.
   - The program then calculates `den` as the product of all multipliers minus the sum of `vprod`. If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution is possible.
   - If `den` is positive, it prints `vprod` as the bets.

#### Verification of Correctness:

- **Correctness of LCM Calculation:**
  - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the LCM of two numbers, which is used iteratively to find the product of all multipliers in `vals`.

- **Generating Valid Bets:**
  - The bets generated (`vprod`) are such that for each outcome `i`, the total bet is `sum(vprod)`, and the payout for winning outcome `i` is `k_i * vprod[i]`.
  - Since `vprod[i]` is the product of all multipliers except `k_i`, `k_i * vprod[i]` is equal to the product of all multipliers. Therefore, `k_i * vprod[i]` is always greater than `sum(vprod)` because `sum(vprod)` is the product minus the term `vprod[i]`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If the sum of `vprod` is equal to or greater than the product of all multipliers, the program correctly returns `-1` indicating no valid distribution is possible.
  - The program handles multiple test cases correctly by calling `func_2` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine a valid distribution of bets or determine that no such distribution is possible. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
