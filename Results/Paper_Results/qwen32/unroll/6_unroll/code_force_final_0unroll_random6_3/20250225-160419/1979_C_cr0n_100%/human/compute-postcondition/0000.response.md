The provided code snippet only includes a single line that reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `N`. The variable `vals` remains unchanged as it is not mentioned or modified in the given code snippet.

Given that `N` was initially described as an integer representing the number of outcomes, and the code reads a new integer value from the input, the new value of `N` will be whatever integer is provided by the input. The variable `vals` retains its initial state as a list of integers representing the multipliers for each outcome.

Output State: **`N` is the integer provided by the input, `vals` is a list of integers representing the multipliers for each outcome (2 <= k_i <= 20 for each k_i in vals).**
