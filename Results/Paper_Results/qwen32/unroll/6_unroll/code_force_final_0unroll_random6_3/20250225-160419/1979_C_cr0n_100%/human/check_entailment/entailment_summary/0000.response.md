To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the provided functions collectively address the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Input**:
   - Multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, an integer `n` representing the number of outcomes.
   - A list of integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` representing the multipliers for each outcome.

2. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output either:
     - `-1` if no valid distribution of bets exists.
     - A list of integers `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` such that the sum of all `x_i` is less than `k_i * x_i` for each `i`.

3. **Constraints**:
   - `1 <= t <= 10^4` (number of test cases).
   - `1 <= n <= 50` (number of outcomes per test case).
   - `2 <= k_i <= 20` (multiplier for each outcome).

### Analysis of Functions:

**Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`**
- **Purpose**: Calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers `a` and `b`.
- **Execution Summary**: Correctly computes the LCM using the formula `a * b // gcd(a, b)`.

**Function 2: `func_2()`**
- **Purpose**: For a given list of multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`, determine if a valid distribution of bets exists and output the bets if possible.
- **Execution Summary**:
  - Reads the number of outcomes `N` and the list of multipliers `vals`.
  - Computes the LCM of all multipliers in `vals` and stores it in `den`.
  - Constructs a list `vprod` where each element is `den // k_i`.
  - Checks if `den - sum(vprod)` is greater than 0.
    - If not, it prints `-1`.
    - Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as the bets.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the multipliers is correctly calculated, which is used to ensure that the bets can be distributed in a way that satisfies the conditions.
- **Bet Distribution**: The bets are derived by dividing the LCM by each multiplier, ensuring that if any outcome wins, the total bet (sum of `vprod`) is less than the received amount (`k_i * vprod[i]`).
- **Validation**: The condition `den - sum(vprod) > 0` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the received amount for any winning outcome.

### Conclusion:
The program, as implemented by the functions `func_1` and `func_2`, correctly addresses the problem requirements. It ensures that the bets are distributed such that the total bet is strictly less than the received amount for any winning outcome, and it handles cases where no valid distribution exists by outputting `-1`.

**Correctness: True**
