The function `func_2` reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `vals`. It calculates the product of all elements in `vals` and then computes a new list `vprod` where each element is the product divided by the corresponding element in `vals`. It subtracts the sum of `vprod` from the product. If the result is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as space-separated values. The function does not return any value.
