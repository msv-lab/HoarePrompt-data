To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, let's break down the provided code and the problem statement.

The code reads from standard input (stdin), starting from the third line and taking every second line thereafter. Each of these lines is expected to contain a sequence of integers. The code then calculates the difference between the number of tokens (integers) in the line and the number of unique tokens. This difference is printed for each relevant line.

Given that each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence at most 2 times, the number of unique tokens in each line will be n, and the number of tokens will be between n and 2n. The difference between the number of tokens and the number of unique tokens will be the count of integers that appear more than once.

Since the problem statement does not specify the exact contents of the lines beyond the constraints, we can infer that the output will be a series of integers, each representing the count of integers that appear more than once in the corresponding input line.

However, the problem asks for the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, and it expects a description of the state in a specific format. Since the output consists of a series of printed integers, the output state can be described as a sequence of these integers.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **A series of integers, each representing the count of integers that appear more than once in the corresponding input line.**

Since the exact input lines are not provided, we cannot generate the exact series of integers. However, the format of the output state is as described above.
