Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of coins Alice has and `k` is the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought. The function returns a result for each test case indicating whether Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels with her `n` coins.**
