Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n` where `n` is the length of `arr` plus one. It returns a list `ans` where each element is determined based on specific rules: the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, each subsequent element is the smallest multiple of the previous element in `ans` that is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in `arr`, and the last element is the sum of the second-to-last element in `ans` and the last element in `arr`.**
