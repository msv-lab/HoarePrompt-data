The code modifies the last element of the list `ans` by setting it to the value of the second-to-last element of `ans` plus the last element of `arr`. Given the initial state, the only change is to the last element of `ans`. 

Output State: **`ans` is [arr[0] + 1, smallest multiple of ans[1] >= arr[1], smallest multiple of ans[2] >= arr[2], ..., ans[-2] + arr[-1]]**.

In natural language: The list `ans` remains the same except for its last element, which is now the sum of its second-to-last element and the last element of `arr`.
