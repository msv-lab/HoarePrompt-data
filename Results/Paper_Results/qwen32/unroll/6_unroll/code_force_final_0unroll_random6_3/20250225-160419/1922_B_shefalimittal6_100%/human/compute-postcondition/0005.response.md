The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are affected by this statement. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `data`, and `idx` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n; `data` is a list of strings representing the split input; `idx` is 1; `results` is an empty list.**
