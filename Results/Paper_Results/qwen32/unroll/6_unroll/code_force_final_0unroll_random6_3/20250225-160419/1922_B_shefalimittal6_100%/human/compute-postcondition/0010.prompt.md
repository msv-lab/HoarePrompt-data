You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        idx += 1
        
        v = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        for _ in range(n):
            x = int(data[idx])
            idx += 1
            v[x] += 1
        
        cnt = 0
        
        ans = 0
        
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if v[i] >= 2:
                ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2
            if v[i] >= 3:
                ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6
            cnt += v[i]
        
        results.append(str(ans))
        
    #State: - After all iterations, the `results` list will contain the results for each of the `t` test cases.
    #   - The `idx` variable will have been incremented by `2 + n` for each test case, where `n` is the number of integers in that test case.
    #   - The `t`, `data`, and other variables not modified by the loop will remain unchanged.
    #
    #Given the above explanation, the output state can be described as follows:
    #
    #Output State:
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: result1\nresult2\n...\nresultt (where result1, result2, ..., resultt are the results for each of the t test cases)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. Specifically, if the conditions or constraints are met, it returns a certain value; otherwise, it may return a different value or handle the input in a specified manner. However, the exact nature of the return value is not detailed in the provided output description.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
