The code snippet provided initializes the variable `idx` to 0. This change affects only the variable `idx`, and no other variables are modified by this code. The initial state specifies the conditions and values for `t`, `n`, the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and the list of strings `data`. Since `idx` is the only variable being changed and it is set to 0, the output state reflects this change while keeping all other variables as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 0 <= a_i <= n; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; `data` is a list of strings representing the split input; `idx` is 0.**
