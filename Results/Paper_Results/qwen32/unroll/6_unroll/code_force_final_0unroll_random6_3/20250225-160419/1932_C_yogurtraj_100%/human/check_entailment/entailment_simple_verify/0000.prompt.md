You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Initialization and Calculation of Initial Product**:
   - The program initializes `k` to the remainder of a specific element of `a` when divided by `m`, but it does not correctly calculate the initial product of all elements of the array `a` before processing any commands.

2. **Incorrect Index Tracking**:
   - The indices `q1` and `q2` are used to track elements to be multiplied, but they are not correctly initialized or updated. Specifically, `q1` and `q2` are not correctly pointing to the elements that should be included in the product at each step.

3. **Incorrect Command Processing**:
   - The logic for processing commands 'L' and 'R' is flawed. The program does not correctly update the product of the remaining elements based on the command.

4. **Reverse Calculation**:
   - The program tries to calculate the product in reverse order, which is not straightforward and can lead to incorrect results. The problem requires calculating the product from the current state of the array after each command.

To correctly implement the solution, we need to calculate the product of all elements initially and then update the product based on the commands 'L' and 'R'. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        commands = input().strip()
        
        # Calculate the initial product of all elements modulo m
        product = 1
        for num in a:
            product = (product * num) % m
        
        result = []
        
        for command in commands:
            result.append(product)
            if command == 'L':
                product = (product * pow(a.pop(0), m-2, m)) % m  # Remove leftmost element
            else:
                product = (product * pow(a.pop(), m-2, m)) % m  # Remove rightmost element
        
        print(*result)

# Example usage
# func()
```

In this corrected version:
- We calculate the initial product of all elements in the array `a` modulo `m`.
- We process each command in order, updating the product by removing the appropriate element and recalculating the product modulo `m`.
- We use modular multiplicative inverse (`pow(a, m-2, m)`) to remove elements from the product efficiently.

This corrected version should work for all test cases as described in the problem statement.
