Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `m`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
