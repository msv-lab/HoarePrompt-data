Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and `nums` is a deque of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `ans` is 0.**

Natural Language: The variable `ans` has been initialized to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums`) retain their initial values and conditions as specified in the initial state.
