Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers, where each integer `p_i` is distinct, satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n, and p_i is not equal to i. It checks if there exists any index `i` such that `p[p[i]]` equals `i`. If such an index exists, it prints `2` and terminates. If no such index exists after checking all possibilities, it prints `3`.**
