You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4), the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), the size of the array a. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n), the elements of the array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        
        first = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True
        
    #State: A series of integers printed to the console, one per test case, representing the smallest non-negative integer that either does not appear in the array or appears exactly once for that test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the size of an array `a`, and the array `a` itself containing `n` integers. The function then processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. Specifically, if the input is valid, the function performs some computation (which is not detailed here) and returns a result based on the array elements. If the input constraints are violated, the behavior is not specified in the given information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
