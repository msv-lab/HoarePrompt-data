The code snippet provided reads an integer value from the input and assigns it to the variable `T`. This value represents the number of test cases, `t`, which was already defined in the initial state. The variable `T` now holds the value of the number of test cases, and the initial conditions for `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged except for the assignment to `T`.

Output State: **`T` is the integer value read from the input; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.**
