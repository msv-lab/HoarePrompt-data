### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided program, the original assessment, and the annotated code to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s followed by all 1s) by performing cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Cost Calculation**: The cost to move a 1 to the right of a 0 is the length of the substring that includes the 1 and all preceding 0s.
2. **Strategy**: Whenever we encounter a 0 after one or more 1s, we need to shift the substring containing these 1s and the 0 to the right of the 0s. The cost of each such shift is the number of 1s before the 0 plus one (the 0 itself).

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of two functions:
- `func_1()`: This function reads a binary string, counts the number of 1s encountered, and calculates the cost whenever a 0 is encountered after one or more 1s.
- `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1()` is incorrectly using `input().split()`, which splits the input based on whitespace. For a binary string, we should just read the string directly using `input()` and then process it.
2. **Conversion to List of Integers**: The function `func_1()` converts the input string to a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This is incorrect for a single string input. It should be `list(input())` to convert the string into a list of characters.
3. **Logic for Cost Calculation**: The logic for calculating the cost is correct. When a 0 is encountered after one or more 1s, the cost is incremented by the number of 1s seen so far plus one (the 0 itself).

#### Annotations:
- The annotations describe the state of the program at key points, indicating the values of `s`, `n`, and `ans` at different stages.
- The state of the program right before the function call in `func_1()` is that `s` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, representing a binary string. `n` is an integer initialized to 0 and is used to count the number of 1s encountered in the list `s`. `ans` is an integer initialized to 0 and is used to accumulate the total cost.
- The state of the program after the function call in `func_1()` indicates that `s` remains a list of integers, `n` is reset to 0, and `ans` is the accumulated cost.

#### Evaluation:
- The logic for calculating the cost is correct as per the problem statement.
- The input handling and conversion to list of integers are incorrect, as mentioned in the original assessment.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to improper input handling and conversion. After correcting these issues, the logic for calculating the cost is correct.

**Correctness: False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
