### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Cyclic Shift**: Moving the last character of a substring to the front.
2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `r-l+1` is `r-l+1`.
3. **Objective**: Minimize the total cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all `0`s followed by all `1`s).

#### Program Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - **Input**: A binary string `s` (converted to a list of integers).
  - **Process**:
    - It iterates through the string.
    - It counts the number of `1`s encountered (`n`).
    - When a `0` is encountered and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to the total cost (`ans`).
  - **Output**: Prints the accumulated cost (`ans`).
  
  **Cost Calculation Logic**:
  - The logic of adding `n + 1` for each `0` encountered after some `1`s is based on the idea that each `0` needs to be shifted past all the `1`s encountered so far. The cost for each `0` is the number of `1`s it needs to pass plus the cost of shifting itself into place, which is `n + 1`.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - **Input**: Number of test cases `t`.
  - **Process**: Calls `func_1` for each test case.
  - **Output**: None (as `func_1` handles the output).

#### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example.

1. **Test Case 1**: `s = "10"`
   - `n = 1` (one `1` encountered)
   - `ans = 1 + 1 = 2` (one `0` encountered after a `1`)
   - Output: `2`

2. **Test Case 2**: `s = "0000"`
   - No `1`s encountered, so `ans = 0`
   - Output: `0`

3. **Test Case 3**: `s = "11000"`
   - `n = 2` (two `1`s encountered)
   - `ans = 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 9` (three `0`s encountered after `1`s)
   - Output: `9`

4. **Test Case 4**: `s = "101011"`
   - `n = 1` (one `1` encountered)
   - `ans = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5` (three `0`s encountered after `1`s)
   - Output: `5`

5. **Test Case 5**: `s = "01101001"`
   - `n = 1` (one `1` encountered)
   - `ans = 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 11` (four `0`s encountered after `1`s)
   - Output: `11`

The program correctly computes the minimum cost for each test case as per the example.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.

**Correctness: True**
