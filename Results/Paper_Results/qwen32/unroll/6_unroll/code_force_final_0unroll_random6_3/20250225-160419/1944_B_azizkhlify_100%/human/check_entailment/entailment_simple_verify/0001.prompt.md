You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem requirements to determine its correctness.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - Multiple test cases.
   - Each test case consists of an integer `n` and `k`.
   - An array `a` of length `2n` where each integer from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice.

2. **Output:**
   - Two arrays `l` and `r` each of length `2k` such that:
     - `l` is a subset of the first `n` elements of `a`.
     - `r` is a subset of the last `n` elements of `a`.
     - The bitwise XOR of elements in `l` equals the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes two arrays `l` and `r` of size `n` to count occurrences of numbers in the first and second halves of the array `a`, respectively.
   - It also initializes `re`, `ul`, `ur`, and `res` to manage the selection of elements for `l` and `r`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - It counts the occurrences of each number in the first half of `a` using the `l` array.
   - It counts the occurrences of each number in the second half of `a` using the `r` array.

3. **Selecting Elements for `l`:**
   - It selects elements that appear twice in the first half of `a` and adds them to `l` until `2k` elements are chosen.
   - If `2k` elements are selected, it breaks the loop.

4. **Handling Remaining Elements for `l`:**
   - If fewer than `2k` elements are selected, it selects additional elements that appear once in the first half of `a` until `2k` elements are chosen.

5. **Printing `l`:**
   - It prints the selected elements for `l`.

6. **Printing `r`:**
   - It prints the elements selected for `r` (which are the same as the elements selected for `l` in this case).

7. **Handling Remaining Elements for `r`:**
   - If the number of elements selected for `l` (`ul`) is not equal to the number of elements selected for `r` (`ur`), it selects elements that appear twice in the second half of `a` and adds them to `r` until `ul` equals `ur`.
   - It prints the selected elements for `r`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Handling of `r`:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the selection of elements for `r`. It simply prints the same elements as `l` and then tries to balance the counts, which is not guaranteed to satisfy the XOR condition.
   
2. **XOR Condition Not Guaranteed:**
   - The program does not ensure that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` equals the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`. It simply selects elements based on their occurrences without considering the XOR condition.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not guarantee that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` equals the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`.

**Correctness: False**
