You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. For each test case, it prints a sequence of integers from `a` based on specific rules: first, it prints `k` pairs of integers that appear twice in the first half of `a`; then, if needed, it prints additional integers from the first half of `a` that appear only once, up to a total of `k` such integers; finally, it prints the remaining integers from the second half of `a` that appear twice, ensuring the total number of printed integers matches the requirements.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as per the problem description. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Initialization and Logic for `l` and `r`**:
   - The program initializes `l` and `r` as arrays of zeros with length `n`, but this is incorrect because `l` and `r` should be lists to store the selected elements, not counters.
   - The program counts occurrences of each number in the first and second halves of the array `a` and tries to build `l` and `r` based on these counts.

2. **Building `l`**:
   - The program adds pairs of identical elements from the first half of the array `a` to `l` until it reaches `2*k` elements.
   - The program then adds additional elements from the first half of the array `a` to `l` if needed until it reaches `2*k` elements.

3. **Building `r`**:
   - The program attempts to balance the elements in `r` based on the elements in `l` but does not ensure that the bitwise XOR of `l` and `r` are equal.

4. **Bitwise XOR Check**:
   - The program does not explicitly check that the bitwise XOR of `l` and `r` are equal. It simply tries to balance the elements but does not ensure the XOR condition.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Input**:
```
1
4 2
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output**:
```
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4
```
or any other valid combination where the bitwise XOR of `l` and `r` are equal.

**Actual Output of the Program**:
```
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4
```
or any other combination that does not necessarily satisfy the XOR condition.

However, the program does not guarantee that the XOR condition is met. For example, if the program selects `l = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `r = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, the XOR condition is met, but for other selections, it may not be.

**Counterexample**:
Let's consider another test case where the program might fail:
```
1
4 2
1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4
```

**Expected Output**:
```
1 1 2 2
3 3 4 4
```
or any other valid combination where the bitwise XOR of `l` and `r` are equal.

**Actual Output of the Program**:
The program might output something like:
```
1 1 2 2
3 3 4 4
```
or any other combination, but it does not guarantee that the XOR condition is met.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all cases as per the problem description, and the correctness is **False**.
