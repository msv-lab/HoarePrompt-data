In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the input `t`. The loop head only contains the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the value of `t`, which determines how many times the loop will run.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop condition is `for _ in range(int(input()))`, which means the loop will execute `int(input())` times.
2. The variable `t` is described as an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 5000`. This implies that `t` should be set to a value within this range for the loop to execute.
3. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`) are described as part of the input inside the loop body, which means they do not need to be adjusted in the state before the loop starts.

Given this, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `t` is set to a value that allows the loop to execute. The simplest and most straightforward value for `t` that ensures the loop executes at least once is `1`.

State: **`t` is 1**
