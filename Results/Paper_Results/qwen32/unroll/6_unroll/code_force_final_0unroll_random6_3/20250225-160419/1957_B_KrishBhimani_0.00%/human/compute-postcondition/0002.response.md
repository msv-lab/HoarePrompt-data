Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `k`. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. Specifically, if `n` and `k` are provided as per the constraints, the function computes and returns a value based on these inputs. The function handles up to `t` test cases, with the total sum of `n` across all test cases not exceeding 2Â·10^5.**
