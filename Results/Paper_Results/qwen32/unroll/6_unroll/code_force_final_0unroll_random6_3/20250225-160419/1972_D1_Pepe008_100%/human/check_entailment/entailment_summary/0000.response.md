Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic used in the program does not align with the conditions specified in the problem statement. The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). The program's approach seems to be based on a different formula or logic that does not match the problem's requirements.

Let's break down the problem's requirement:
- For each pair (a, b), we need to check if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0.
- The program instead calculates a sum based on some formula that involves `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` and adjusts it with certain conditions, which is not related to the problem's requirement.

The execution summary provided does not indicate that the program is correctly solving the problem, as it only describes what the program does rather than verifying its correctness against the problem's conditions.

Given the mismatch between the problem's requirements and the program's logic, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
