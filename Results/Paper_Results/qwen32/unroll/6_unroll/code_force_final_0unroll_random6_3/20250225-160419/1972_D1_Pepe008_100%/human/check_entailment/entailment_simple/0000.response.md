### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem statement to determine if the program correctly implements the solution.

The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The provided program seems to be attempting to solve this problem by iterating over possible values of \(b\) and calculating the corresponding values of \(a\) that satisfy the given conditions. However, the logic used in the program does not seem to correctly implement the required conditions.

Let's break down the logic of the program:
- The program reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the values \(n\) and \(m\).
- It then iterates over possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
- For each \(b\), it calculates \(x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).
- It checks if this \(x\) is positive and adds it to `suma`.
- It also checks some additional conditions that seem to be incorrect or unnecessary for solving the problem.

The key issue here is that the program does not correctly implement the condition that \(a + b\) should be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The program does not compute the gcd of \(a\) and \(b\) and does not check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a correct approach to solve the problem:
1. Iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
2. For each \(b\), iterate over all possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).
3. For each pair \((a, b)\), compute \(\gcd(a, b)\).
4. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
5. Count the number of valid pairs.

Given the complexity of the problem and the constraints, a direct approach may not be efficient. However, the provided program does not even implement the basic logic correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the required conditions for counting the valid pairs.

Correctness: **False**
