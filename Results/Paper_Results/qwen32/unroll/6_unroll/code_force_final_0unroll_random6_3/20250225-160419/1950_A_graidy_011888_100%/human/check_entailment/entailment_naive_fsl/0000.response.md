Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies whether the three given digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It then checks:
   - If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
   - If `a < b` and `b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NONE".

The program handles all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` within the given constraints (0 to 9). It correctly identifies the conditions for a "STAIR" and a "PEAK" and defaults to "NONE" for all other cases. The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
