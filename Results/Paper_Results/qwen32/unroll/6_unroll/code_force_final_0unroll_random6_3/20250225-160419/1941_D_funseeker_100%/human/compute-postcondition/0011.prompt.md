You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of players such that 2 <= n <= 1000, m is an integer representing the number of throws such that 1 <= m <= 1000, and x is an integer representing the starting player such that 1 <= x <= n.
def func_4():
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)
        
        temp = set()
        
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        
        ans = temp
        
    #State: `n`, `m`, `x` are the same as in the initial state, and `ans` is a set of values derived from repeatedly applying the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` based on the values of `c` over `m` iterations.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: `n`, `m`, `x` are the same as in the initial state, and `ans` is a set of values derived from repeatedly applying the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` based on the values of `c` over `m` iterations. If `0` was in `ans`, it is now excluded, and `n` is included in `ans`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: len(ans) (where ans contains n and possibly other unique values derived from the operations, with 0 excluded if it was present)
    print(*sorted(ans))
    #This is printed: the sorted values of the set `ans` (which includes `n` and possibly other values derived from the operations, with `0` excluded if it was present)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of players, where 2 <= n <= 1000), `m` (an integer representing the number of throws, where 1 <= m <= 1000), and `x` (an integer representing the starting player, where 1 <= x <= n). The function returns the number of the player who will be the last to receive the throw after `m` throws, starting from player `x`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
