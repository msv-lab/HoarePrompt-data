Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of players, where 2 <= n <= 1000), `m` (an integer representing the number of throws, where 1 <= m <= 1000), and `x` (an integer representing the starting player, where 1 <= x <= n). The function returns the number of the player who will be the last to receive the throw after `m` throws, starting from player `x`.**
