Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of how the program works and why it's correct:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` to read lines of input efficiently.
   - It defines helper functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` to read different types of input (strings, integers, and lists of integers, respectively).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the initial player `x`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` containing the starting player `x`.

3. **Processing Each Throw:**
   - For each throw, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - If the direction `c` is '0' (clockwise) or '?', it adds the player number `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`.
   - If the direction `c` is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?', it adds the player number `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`.
   - The set `ans` is updated to `temp` after processing each throw.

4. **Handling Modulo Operation:**
   - The modulo operation ensures that the player numbers wrap around correctly in the circle.
   - The program checks if `0` is in `ans` and replaces it with `n` if necessary, although this is not strictly needed due to how the modulo operation works in Python (Python's modulo operation with a positive divisor always returns a non-negative result).

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all throws, the program prints the number of possible players who could have the ball and their numbers in sorted order.

The logic correctly handles all possible scenarios, including when the direction of some throws is unknown ('?'). The use of a set ensures that each player number is unique, and the final output is sorted as required.

Therefore, the program is correct.
