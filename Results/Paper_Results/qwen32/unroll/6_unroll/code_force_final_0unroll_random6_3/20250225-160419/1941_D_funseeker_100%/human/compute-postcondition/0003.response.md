To determine the final state after the loop, we need to understand how the variables `n`, `m`, `x`, and `ans` are manipulated within the loop.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned values from `func_3()`.
   - `ans` is initialized as a set containing the single element `x`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs `m` times.
   - In each iteration:
     - `r` and `c` are obtained from `func_1()`, where `r` is converted to an integer.
     - A temporary set `temp` is created.
     - For each element `q` in `ans`:
       - If `c` is '0' or '?', `(q + r) % n` is added to `temp`.
       - If `c` is '1' or '?', `(q - r) % n` is added to `temp`.
     - After processing all elements in `ans`, `ans` is updated to be the contents of `temp`.

3. **Final State:**
   - The final state of `ans` will be a set of values derived from the initial `x` by repeatedly applying the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` based on the values of `c` over `m` iterations.
   - The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

The final state can be described as:
- `n`, `m`, and `x` retain their initial values.
- `ans` is a set of values that are the result of the operations performed in the loop.

Given this understanding, the output state can be described as:

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x` are the same as in the initial state, and `ans` is a set of values derived from repeatedly applying the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` based on the values of `c` over `m` iterations.**
