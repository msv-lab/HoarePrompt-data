Let's analyze the code step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the given problem description.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Objective:** Build `k` bridges over consecutive rows of a river grid to minimize the total cost of installing supports. Each bridge spans from the first column (river bank) to the last column (river bank) with supports placed at specific positions according to the following rules:
   - A support must be placed in the first and last columns.
   - The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
   - The cost of installing a support at position `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.

2. **Constraints:**
   - `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100`
   - `3 ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5`
   - `1 ≤ d ≤ m`
   - `0 ≤ a_{i,j} ≤ 10^6`
   - `a_{i,1} = a_{i,m} = 0` for all `i`.

3. **Approach:**
   - For each row, determine the minimum cost to install supports such that the constraints are met.
   - Sum the costs for `k` consecutive rows to find the minimum total cost.

### Code Analysis

#### Function `func_1(row, d)`

- **Purpose:** Calculate the minimum cost to install supports in a single row.
- **Implementation:**
  - Initialize the first `d` supports with costs incremented by 2.
  - Use a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost of supports within the last `d+2` columns.
  - For each subsequent column, find the minimum cost of a support within the last `d+2` columns and add the current cell's cost plus 1.
  - Push the new cost to the heap.
- **Correctness Consideration:** This function seems to be attempting to find the minimum cost path for supports in a single row, but the logic for handling the heap might not be correctly implemented. Specifically, the `while` loop that pops elements from the heap until an element within the last `d+2` columns is found could be incorrect. It does not re-push the popped elements back into the heap, which could lead to incorrect results.

#### Function `func_2()`

- **Purpose:** Read input, process each row using `func_1`, and find the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.
- **Implementation:**
  - Read the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, read the grid dimensions (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`), the grid itself, and calculate the cost for each row using `func_1`.
  - Calculate the total cost for each set of `k` consecutive rows and find the minimum total cost.
  - Print the minimum total cost.
- **Correctness Consideration:** The logic for summing the costs of `k` consecutive rows and finding the minimum total cost seems correct. However, the correctness of the results heavily depends on the correctness of `func_1`.

### Conclusion

The primary issue with the given program lies in the implementation of `func_1`. The logic for handling the heap and ensuring that the minimum cost path is correctly calculated seems flawed. Specifically, the `while` loop that handles the heap could be incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to be correct based on the provided implementation.

**Correctness: False**
