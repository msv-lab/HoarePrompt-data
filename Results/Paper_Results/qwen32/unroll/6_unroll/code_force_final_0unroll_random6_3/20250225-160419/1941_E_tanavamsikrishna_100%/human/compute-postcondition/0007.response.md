Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of rows, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of columns such that `m >= 3`, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of bridges such that `1 <= k <= n`, and `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports such that `1 <= d <= m`. The function returns a configuration of bridges based on these parameters.**
