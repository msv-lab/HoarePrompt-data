### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum cost of building `k` bridges over consecutive rows of a river grid, where each bridge must have supports installed according to specific rules. The cost for each support is `a_{i,j} + 1`, and the supports must be installed at the first and last columns of each row, with additional supports no more than `d` columns apart.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: To calculate the minimum cost of building a bridge on a single row.
- **Logic**:
  1. The first element of the row is set to `1`.
  2. The next `d-1` elements are incremented by `2` each.
  3. A min-heap is used to keep track of the minimum cost up to the current position, ensuring that the distance between supports does not exceed `d`.
  4. For each element from position `d` to the end of the row, the cost is updated based on the minimum cost found in the heap up to `d` positions before the current element.
- **Output**: The last element of the modified row, which represents the minimum cost for that row.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: To calculate the minimum total cost of building `k` bridges over consecutive rows.
- **Logic**:
  1. Read the input parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
  2. Read the grid of depths.
  3. Compute the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`.
  4. Calculate the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
  5. Output the minimum of these total costs.

#### Analysis:
- **Correctness of `func_1`**: The function correctly calculates the minimum cost for a single row by considering the constraints and using a heap to efficiently find the minimum cost within the allowed distance `d`.
- **Correctness of `func_2`**: The function correctly computes the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and outputs the minimum total cost.

### Conclusion:
Both functions are logically correct and implement the required logic to solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: **True**
