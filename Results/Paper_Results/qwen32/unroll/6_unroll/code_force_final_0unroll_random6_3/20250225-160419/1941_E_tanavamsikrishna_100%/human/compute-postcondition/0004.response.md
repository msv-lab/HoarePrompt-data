To determine the necessary adjustments for the program state before the for loop starts, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):`. Therefore, the variables `i`, `costs`, and `k` can be adjusted.

Let's break down the conditions:
1. `costs` is a list where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`. This list's length is dependent on the number of rows, `n`.
2. `k` is an integer representing the number of bridges such that `1 <= k <= n`.
3. The loop will execute if `len(costs) - (k - 1)` is greater than 0, which means `len(costs) >= k`.

Since `len(costs)` is equal to `n` (because `costs` is computed for each row in `rows` and there are `n` rows), the loop will execute if `n >= k`.

Given the constraints:
- `n` is the number of rows.
- `k` is the number of bridges with `1 <= k <= n`.

The only variable we need to adjust in the loop head is `k` to ensure that `len(costs) - (k - 1)` is at least 1, which translates to `n >= k`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `k` is within the valid range and `n` is at least `k`.

State: **`n` is an input integer representing the number of rows, `m` is an input integer representing the number of columns such that `m` >= 3, `k` is an input integer representing the number of bridges such that 1 <= `k` <= `n`, `d` is an input integer representing the maximum distance between supports such that 1 <= `d` <= `m`, `rows` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `costs` is a list where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`, `total_costs` is an empty list, `n` must be at least `k`**
