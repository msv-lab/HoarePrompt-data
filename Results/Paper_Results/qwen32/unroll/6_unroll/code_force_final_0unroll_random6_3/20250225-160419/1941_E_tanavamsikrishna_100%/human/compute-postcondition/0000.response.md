The code snippet reads four integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` respectively. This means the initial values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are overwritten by the new values provided in the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the number of rows, `m` is an input integer representing the number of columns such that `m` >= 3, `k` is an input integer representing the number of bridges such that 1 <= `k` <= `n`, `d` is an input integer representing the maximum distance between supports such that 1 <= `d` <= `m`.**
