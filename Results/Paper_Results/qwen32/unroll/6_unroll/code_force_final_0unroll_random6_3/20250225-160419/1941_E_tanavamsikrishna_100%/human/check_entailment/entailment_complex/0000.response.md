### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to ensure it meets the requirements:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - We need to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows of the river grid.
   - Each bridge must have supports installed in such a way that:
     - A support must be installed in the first and last columns of the row.
     - The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
     - The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.
   - Our goal is to minimize the total cost of installing supports.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1(row, d)`**:
     - This function calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row, considering the maximum distance `d` between supports.
     - It initializes the first element to 1 and the next `d-1` elements by adding 2.
     - It uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost for each position in the row, ensuring that the supports are placed according to the constraints.
     - The function returns the last element of the modified row, which represents the minimum cost of installing supports for that row.

   - **Function `func_2()`**:
     - This function reads the input values for the number of rows (`n`), columns (`m`), number of bridges (`k`), and maximum distance between supports (`d`).
     - It reads the grid of river depths.
     - It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
     - It computes the sum of costs for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
     - It prints the minimum sum of these costs.

3. **Correctness Evaluation**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly calculates the minimum cost for a single row by using a min-heap to ensure that the supports are placed according to the constraints. The use of a heap allows it to efficiently find the minimum cost while adhering to the distance constraint `d`.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly reads the input, calculates the cost for each row, and then finds the minimum sum of costs for `k` consecutive rows. This ensures that the bridges are built on the most cost-effective set of consecutive rows.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program meets the problem requirements.

### Correctness: **True**
