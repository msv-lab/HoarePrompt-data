Let's carefully analyze the given Python program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: We need to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid, each with supports that minimize the total cost. Supports must be installed in the first and last columns (depth 0), and the distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i, j} + 1`. The cost of a row is the sum of the costs of the supports in that row.
3. **Constraints**: 
   - The first and last columns have a depth of 0.
   - The maximum distance between supports in a row is `d`.
   - We need to find the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: Computes the minimum cost to build a bridge on a single row.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Sets the first `d` elements of the row according to a specific pattern.
     - Uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum costs of supports within the last `d+2` columns.
     - For each subsequent column, it calculates the cost by adding the minimum cost from the heap, the current cell's depth, and 1.
     - Returns the cost of the last column, which represents the minimum cost to build a bridge on that row.
2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: Reads input, computes the cost for each row using `func_1`, and then finds the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Reads the number of test cases.
     - For each test case, reads the dimensions (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`) and the grid.
     - Computes the cost for each row using `func_1`.
     - Computes the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.
     - Prints the minimum total cost.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function seems to correctly compute the minimum cost for a single row by using dynamic programming with a min-heap to ensure that the distance constraint is respected.
  - However, the initialization of the first `d` elements is unclear and may not be correct for all scenarios. It seems to assume a specific pattern that may not be universally correct.
- **Function `func_2`**:
  - The function correctly reads input and computes the cost for each row.
  - It correctly computes the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.
  - However, the correctness of the final result depends on the correctness of `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program's correctness hinges on the correctness of `func_1`. If `func_1` correctly computes the minimum cost for a single row under the given constraints, then the program is correct. However, the initialization of the first `d` elements in `func_1` is unclear and may not be correct for all scenarios.

Therefore, without a rigorous proof of the correctness of `func_1`, we cannot conclusively state that the program is correct.

**Correctness: False**
