### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summaries to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap
Bernard needs to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid to minimize the total cost of installing supports. The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`. The conditions for installing supports are:
1. A support must be installed in cell `(i,1)`.
2. A support must be installed in cell `(i,m)`.
3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.

#### Code Analysis

The code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(row, d)`: This function calculates the minimum cost to build a bridge on a single row `row` with a maximum distance `d` between supports.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads input, calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`, and then finds the minimum total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges.

##### Function `func_1(row, d)`
- The function initializes the first `d` elements of the row with specific values.
- It uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost to install supports up to a certain column.
- The loop iterates over each column starting from `d` and calculates the minimum cost to install a support at that column based on the previous supports within the distance `d`.

##### Issues in `func_1`
- The condition `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2): pass` is problematic. It pops elements from the heap without using them, which means the heap is being emptied unnecessarily.
- The correct approach would be to pop elements from the heap until the column index is within the valid range (`i - d` to `i`).
- The cost calculation `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1` is incorrect. The cost should be `row[i] + 1` added to the minimum cost of the previous valid support, not `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.
- The correct cost calculation should be `row[i] = e[0] + 1` if `row[i]` is the depth at column `i`.

##### Function `func_2()`
- The function reads input values for the number of rows (`n`), columns (`m`), number of bridges (`k`), and maximum distance between supports (`d`).
- It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
- It then finds the minimum total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges.

##### Issues in `func_2()`
- The function correctly calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
- It then finds the minimum total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges, which is the correct approach.

#### Conclusion

Given the issues identified with the heap management and cost calculation in `func_1`, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost of installing supports for each row. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

### Example of Incorrectness

Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 5 1 1
0 1 2 1 0
0 2 3 2 0
0 1 2 1 0
```

Expected output: `2` (build the bridge on the first row with supports at columns 1 and 5)

Actual output: Incorrect due to the issues in `func_1`.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**.

Final: **False**
