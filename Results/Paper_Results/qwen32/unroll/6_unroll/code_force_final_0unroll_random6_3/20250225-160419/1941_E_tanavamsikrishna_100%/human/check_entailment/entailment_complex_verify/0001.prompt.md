You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is
that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his
friend solve this problem.

The river is a grid of n rows and m columns. The intersection of the i -th row
and the j -th column contains the number a_{i,j} — the depth in the
corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the
river banks, so the depth for them is 0 .

The river may look like this.

Rudolf can choose the row (i,1), (i,2), \ldots, (i,m) and build a bridge over
it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost
of installing a support in the cell (i,j) is a_{i,j}+1 . Supports must be
installed so that the following conditions are met:

  1. A support must be installed in cell (i,1) ; 
  2. A support must be installed in cell (i,m) ; 
  3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d . The distance between supports (i, j_1) and (i, j_2) is |j_1 - j_2| - 1 . 

Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k
bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i (1 \le i
\le n - k + 1 ) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i, i + 1,
\ldots, i + k - 1 . Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing
supports.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , m , k , and d (1
\le k \le n \le 100 , 3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le d \le m ) — the number
of rows and columns of the field, the number of bridges, and the maximum
distance between supports.

Then follow n lines, i -th line contains m positive integers a_{i, j} (0 \le
a_{i, j} \le 10^6 , a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 ) — the depths of the river cells.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot m for all sets of input data does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum total cost of
supports installation.

Note

In the first test case, it is most profitable to build a bridge on the second
row.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/6b5282a065196a0a0ca650a68a351af816de8549.png)
It is not a top view, but side view: gray cells — bridge itself, white cells
are empty, black cells — supports, blue cells — water, brown cells — river
bottom.

In the second test case, it is most profitable to build bridges on the second
and third rows. The supports will be placed in cells (2, 3) , (3, 2) , and on
the river banks.

In the third test case the supports can be placed along the river banks.

    #The program returns the last element of `row`, which is the result of the last update operation involving the last popped element from `min_heap`, the original value of `row[-1]`, and 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` modifies a given list `row` of integers by setting the first element to 1 and incrementing the next `d-1` elements by 2. It then updates the remaining elements of `row` based on a min-heap data structure, which considers the maximum distance `d` between supports. Finally, the function returns the last element of the modified `row`.

    #   - The number of elements in `total_costs` will be `len(costs) - (k - 1)`, which is equivalent to `n - (k - 1)` because `len(costs) == n`.

    #
    #Since the exact values of `costs` and `k` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `min(total_costs)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the minimum sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input values for the number of rows (`n`), columns (`m`), number of bridges (`k`), and maximum distance between supports (`d`). It then calculates the minimum sum of costs for `k` consecutive rows, where each row's cost is determined by a separate function `func_1` with the maximum distance `d`. The function outputs this minimum sum.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the code step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the given problem description.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Objective:** Build `k` bridges over consecutive rows of a river grid to minimize the total cost of installing supports. Each bridge spans from the first column (river bank) to the last column (river bank) with supports placed at specific positions according to the following rules:
   - A support must be placed in the first and last columns.
   - The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
   - The cost of installing a support at position `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.

2. **Constraints:**
   - `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100`
   - `3 ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5`
   - `1 ≤ d ≤ m`
   - `0 ≤ a_{i,j} ≤ 10^6`
   - `a_{i,1} = a_{i,m} = 0` for all `i`.

3. **Approach:**
   - For each row, determine the minimum cost to install supports such that the constraints are met.
   - Sum the costs for `k` consecutive rows to find the minimum total cost.

### Code Analysis

#### Function `func_1(row, d)`

- **Purpose:** Calculate the minimum cost to install supports in a single row.
- **Implementation:**
  - Initialize the first `d` supports with costs incremented by 2.
  - Use a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost of supports within the last `d+2` columns.
  - For each subsequent column, find the minimum cost of a support within the last `d+2` columns and add the current cell's cost plus 1.
  - Push the new cost to the heap.
- **Correctness Consideration:** This function seems to be attempting to find the minimum cost path for supports in a single row, but the logic for handling the heap might not be correctly implemented. Specifically, the `while` loop that pops elements from the heap until an element within the last `d+2` columns is found could be incorrect. It does not re-push the popped elements back into the heap, which could lead to incorrect results.

#### Function `func_2()`

- **Purpose:** Read input, process each row using `func_1`, and find the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.
- **Implementation:**
  - Read the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, read the grid dimensions (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`), the grid itself, and calculate the cost for each row using `func_1`.
  - Calculate the total cost for each set of `k` consecutive rows and find the minimum total cost.
  - Print the minimum total cost.
- **Correctness Consideration:** The logic for summing the costs of `k` consecutive rows and finding the minimum total cost seems correct. However, the correctness of the results heavily depends on the correctness of `func_1`.

### Conclusion

The primary issue with the given program lies in the implementation of `func_1`. The logic for handling the heap and ensuring that the minimum cost path is correctly calculated seems flawed. Specifically, the `while` loop that handles the heap could be incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to be correct based on the provided implementation.

**Correctness: False**
