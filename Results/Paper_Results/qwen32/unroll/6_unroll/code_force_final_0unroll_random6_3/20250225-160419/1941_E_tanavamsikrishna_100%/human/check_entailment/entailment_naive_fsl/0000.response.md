Let's analyze the provided code against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Analysis

The problem requires building `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid, with the goal of minimizing the total cost of installing supports. The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`. The conditions for installing supports are:
1. A support must be installed in cell `(i,1)`.
2. A support must be installed in cell `(i,m)`.
3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.

The code provided consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(row, d)`: This function calculates the minimum cost to build a bridge on a single row `row` with a maximum distance `d` between supports.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads input, calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`, and then finds the minimum total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges.

### Issues in the Code

1. **Heap Management in `func_1`**:
   - The code uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost to install supports up to a certain column.
   - The condition `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2): pass` is problematic. It pops elements from the heap without using them, which means the heap is being emptied unnecessarily.
   - The correct approach would be to pop elements from the heap until the column index is within the valid range (`i - d` to `i`).

2. **Cost Calculation in `func_1`**:
   - The cost calculation `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1` is incorrect. The cost should be `row[i] + 1` added to the minimum cost of the previous valid support, not `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.
   - The correct cost calculation should be `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1` simplified to `row[i] = e[0] + 1` if `row[i]` is the depth at column `i`.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where `d` is very small or `k` is equal to `n`.
   - The code does not ensure that the supports are placed correctly according to the problem constraints.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified with the heap management and cost calculation in `func_1`, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost of installing supports for each row. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

### Example of Incorrectness

Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 5 1 1
0 1 2 1 0
0 2 3 2 0
0 1 2 1 0
```

Expected output: `2` (build the bridge on the first row with supports at columns 1 and 5)

Actual output: Incorrect due to the issues in `func_1`.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**.
