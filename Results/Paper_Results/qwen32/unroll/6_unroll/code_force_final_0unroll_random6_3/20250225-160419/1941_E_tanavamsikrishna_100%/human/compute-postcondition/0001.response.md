The code provided reads `n` rows of input, where each row contains integers separated by spaces. These integers are collected into a 2D list named `rows`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the number of rows, `m` is an input integer representing the number of columns such that `m` >= 3, `k` is an input integer representing the number of bridges such that 1 <= `k` <= `n`, `d` is an input integer representing the maximum distance between supports such that 1 <= `d` <= `m`, `rows` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns.**

In natural language: The output state includes the same values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` as the initial state. Additionally, `rows` is now a 2D list containing `n` rows of integers, where each row has `m` integers.
