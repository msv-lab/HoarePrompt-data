The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The state of `n` and the list of pages `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` does not affect whether the loop will execute, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
