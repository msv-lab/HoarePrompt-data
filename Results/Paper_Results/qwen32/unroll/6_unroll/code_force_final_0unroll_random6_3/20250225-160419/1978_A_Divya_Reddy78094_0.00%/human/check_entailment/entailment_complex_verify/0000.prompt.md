You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice has n books. The 1 -st book contains a_1 pages, the 2 -nd book contains
a_2 pages, \ldots , the n -th book contains a_n pages. Alice does the
following:

  * She divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.
  * Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile.

Alice loves reading very much. Help her find the maximum total number of pages
she can read by dividing the books into two piles.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 100
) — the number of books Alice has.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the number of pages in each book.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of pages
Alice can read.

Note

In the first test case, Alice can put book number 1 in the first pile, and
book number 2 in the second pile. Then she will read a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2
pages.

In the second test case, Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first
pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read
the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the
highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she will read a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 =
4 pages.

def func():

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of books. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of pages in each book. The number of test cases t is given at the beginning and satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        
        print(nums[0] + nums[1])
        
    #State: For each test case, the sum of the two largest numbers from the list of pages is printed. The values of `t`, `n`, and `nums` are not retained after each iteration and are reinitialized in each loop iteration based on the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:For each test case, the function calculates and prints the sum of the two largest numbers from a list of integers representing the number of pages in books.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly find the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles. The program simply sorts the list of books in descending order and always adds the two largest numbers together, which does not necessarily give the maximum sum of the highest number in each pile.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
3
3
1 2 100
```
The correct way to divide the books would be to put the book with 100 pages in one pile and the books with 1 and 2 pages in the other pile. This way, Alice can read 100 + 2 = 102 pages.

However, the provided program will sort the books as [100, 2, 1] and add the two largest numbers together, resulting in 100 + 2 = 102, which is correct for this case but not always. Let's consider another case:
```
4
4
1 2 3 4
```
The correct way to divide the books would be to put the book with 4 pages in one pile and the books with 1, 2, and 3 pages in the other pile. This way, Alice can read 4 + 3 = 7 pages.

However, the provided program will sort the books as [4, 3, 2, 1] and add the two largest numbers together, resulting in 4 + 3 = 7, which is correct for this case but not always. Let's consider another case:
```
4
4
1 2 3 2

The correct way to divide the books would be to put the books with 3 and 2 pages in one pile and the books with 1 and 2 pages in the other pile. This way, Alice can read 3 + 2 = 5 pages.
