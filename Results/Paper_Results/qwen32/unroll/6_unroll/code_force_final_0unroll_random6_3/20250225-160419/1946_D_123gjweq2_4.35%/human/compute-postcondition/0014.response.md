Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`.**

This means that the program compares the result of calling `find_max` with `cur_arr` and `bit - 1` to the number of elements in `new_arr`, and it returns whichever of these two values is greater.
