Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= `bit` <= 29, `new_arr` is a list containing intermediate XOR values where the `bit`-th bit was 0, `xor` is the final XOR value after the loop, and the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 1, `thing1` is -1.**

Natural Language: The value of `thing1` has been changed to -1. All other variables remain unchanged with their initial values.
