arr is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i < 2^30, and x is an integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30. The function is called multiple times with different test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5) representing the length of arr, and arr itself. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
