The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies `t` as an integer within a certain range and `s` as a binary string with specific constraints. The execution of the code does not affect `t` or `s` in any way; it only introduces a new variable `n` with the value of the input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `s` is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and '1's) with length 2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5. The sum of the lengths of all strings `s` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `n` is the integer value of the input.**
