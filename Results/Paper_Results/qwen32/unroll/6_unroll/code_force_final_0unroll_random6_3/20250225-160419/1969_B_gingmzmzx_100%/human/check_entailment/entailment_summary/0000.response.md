Explanation: Let's analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem description to determine its correctness.

The problem description asks for the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of a cyclic shift is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

The provided code does not directly calculate the cost of cyclic shifts. Instead, it seems to be counting the number of inversions in the binary string, where an inversion is defined as a '0' following a '1'. The code counts the number of '1's that appear before each '0' and the number of '0's that appear after each '1'. This count is then printed as the answer.

However, the problem requires calculating the minimum cost to sort the string using cyclic shifts, not just counting inversions. The cost involves the length of the substring being shifted, which the current code does not account for. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Let's consider an example to demonstrate the discrepancy:

Example:
Input:
```
1
1010
```
Expected Output:
```
2
```
Explanation:
We can achieve the sorted string "0011" by performing the following operations:
1. Choose substring [1, 2] (10 -> 01), cost = 2
2. Choose substring [3, 4] (01 -> 00), cost = 2 (However, we can do better)
3. Choose substring [2, 3] (10 -> 01), cost = 2 (However, we can do better)
