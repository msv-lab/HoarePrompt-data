Reasoning:
1. The problem requires us to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners.
2. For a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the area can be determined by the distance between any two adjacent corners.
3. The program reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, reads the coordinates of the four corners.
4. It then calculates the squared distance between two pairs of corners, specifically between (a, b) and (e, f), and between (c, d) and (g, h).
5. The squared distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by \((x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2\).
6. The program assumes that the larger of these two squared distances corresponds to the side of the square (this assumption is incorrect).
7. The correct approach would be to identify the unique x and y coordinates among the four points, calculate the side length as the difference between the maximum and minimum of the x-coordinates (or y-coordinates), and then square this side length to get the area.
8. The given program does not correctly identify the side length of the square and hence does not correctly compute the area in all cases.

Example:
Consider the test case:
```
1
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
```
The correct side length is 3 (distance between x-coordinates 1 and 4), and the area should be 9. The program calculates the squared distances as 9 and 9, but it incorrectly prints 9 (which happens to be correct in this case by chance).

However, consider another test case:
```
1
1 1
2 1
1 2
2 2
```
The correct side length is 1, and the area should be 1. The program calculates the squared distances as 1 and 1, and it prints 1, which is correct.

But the program will fail in cases where the distances are not equal, such as:
```
1
0 0
0 3
3 0
3 3
```
Here, the correct side length is 3, and the area should be 9. The program calculates the squared distances as 9 and 9, but if the points were read in a different order, it might calculate different distances, leading to an incorrect result.

Therefore, the program does not handle all cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**
