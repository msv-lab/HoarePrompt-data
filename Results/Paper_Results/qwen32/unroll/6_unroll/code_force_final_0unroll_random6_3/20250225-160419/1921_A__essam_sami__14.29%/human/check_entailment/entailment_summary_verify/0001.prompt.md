You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

        (c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        (e, f) = map(int, input().split())
        (g, h) = map(int, input().split())
        n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
        x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)
        if x > n:
            print(n)
        else:
            print(x)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. It then calculates the squared distances between two pairs of opposite corners and prints the smaller of the two squared distances for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The problem requires us to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners.
2. For a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the area can be determined by the distance between any two adjacent corners.
3. The program reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, reads the coordinates of the four corners.
4. It then calculates the squared distance between two pairs of corners, specifically between (a, b) and (e, f), and between (c, d) and (g, h).
5. The squared distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by \((x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2\).
6. The program assumes that the larger of these two squared distances corresponds to the side of the square (this assumption is incorrect).
7. The correct approach would be to identify the unique x and y coordinates among the four points, calculate the side length as the difference between the maximum and minimum of the x-coordinates (or y-coordinates), and then square this side length to get the area.
8. The given program does not correctly identify the side length of the square and hence does not correctly compute the area in all cases.

Example:
Consider the test case:
```
1
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
```
The correct side length is 3 (distance between x-coordinates 1 and 4), and the area should be 9. The program calculates the squared distances as 9 and 9, but it incorrectly prints 9 (which happens to be correct in this case by chance).

However, consider another test case:
```
1
1 1
2 1
1 2
2 2
```
The correct side length is 1, and the area should be 1. The program calculates the squared distances as 1 and 1, and it prints 1, which is correct.

But the program will fail in cases where the distances are not equal, such as:
```
1
0 0
0 3
3 0
3 3
```
Here, the correct side length is 3, and the area should be 9. The program calculates the squared distances as 9 and 9, but if the points were read in a different order, it might calculate different distances, leading to an incorrect result.

Therefore, the program does not handle all cases correctly.
