You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-". s
represents an array a of length n defined by a_i=1 if s_i= "+" and a_i=-1 if
s_i= "-".

You will do the following process to calculate your penalty:

  1. Split a into non-empty arrays b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k such that b_1+b_2+\ldots+b_k=a^\dagger , where + denotes array concatenation. 
  2. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. In other words, for some array c of length m , its penalty is calculated as p(c)=|c_1+c_2+\ldots+c_m| \cdot m . 
  3. The total penalty that you will receive is p(b_1)+p(b_2)+\ldots+p(b_k) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger Some valid ways to split a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k) are
([3],[1],[4],[1],[5]) , ([3,1],[4,1,5]) and ([3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,1],[1,5]) , ([3],[\,],[1,4],[1,5]) and ([3,4],[5,1,1])
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the length of string s .

The second line of each test case contains string s (s_i \in \\{ \mathtt{+},
\mathtt{-} \\} , |s| = n ).

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Output

    1
    5
    0
    4
    4
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a=[1] . We can split array a into ([1]) .
Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is p([1]) = 1 .

In the second test case, we have a=[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] . We can split array a
into ([-1],[-1],[-1],[-1],[-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays
is p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 .

In the third test case, we have a=[1,-1,1,-1,1,-1] . We can split array a into
([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is
p([1,-1,1,-1]) + p([1,-1]) = 0 + 0 = 0 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    func_1()
    t -= 1

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    neg = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '-':
            neg += 1
    print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes each test case by reading an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of '+' and '-' characters. It calculates and prints the result as `n - 2 * neg` if the string contains both '+' and '-' characters, or if there are more '+' characters than '-' characters. If the string contains only '-' characters, it prints `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The program simply counts the number of '-' characters and computes a value based on that count, which does not align with the penalty calculation rules given.

Let's break down why this is incorrect:

1. **Penalty Calculation**: The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The program does not consider subarrays or their sums at all.

2. **Optimal Splitting**: The program does not attempt to find an optimal way to split the array into subarrays to minimize the total penalty. It only considers the total number of '-' characters and computes a simple value, which is not an optimal strategy.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `--+++++++-`, the program calculates the number of '-' characters (4) and outputs `10 - 2 * 4 = 2`. However, the correct minimum penalty is `4`, which can be achieved by splitting the array into optimal subarrays.

To correctly solve this problem, a dynamic programming approach or a greedy strategy that considers the optimal way to split the array into subarrays based on their sums is needed. The provided program does not implement such logic.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:
- **Input**: `10\n--+++++++-`
- **Expected Output**: `4`
- **Actual Output**: `2`

Thus, the program is incorrect.
