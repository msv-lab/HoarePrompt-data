Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`, where:
- `a_i = 1` if `s_i = '+'`
- `a_i = -1` if `s_i = '-'`

The penalty for a subarray `c` is calculated as:
- `p(c) = |sum(c)| * len(c)`

The goal is to split `a` into subarrays such that the sum of penalties for all subarrays is minimized.

### Key Insight
The optimal strategy for minimizing the penalty involves forming subarrays where the sum is zero (`0`), as this would result in a penalty of `0`. If the entire array can be split into such subarrays, the total penalty will be `0`.

### Detailed Analysis
1. **Counting '+' and '-'**:
   - The program counts the number of `'-'` characters in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `neg`.
   - The number of `'+'` characters can be derived as `n - neg`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.

2. **Calculating the Penalty**:
   - If the number of `'+'` characters is equal to the number of `'-'` characters (`n == 2 * neg`), then it is possible to split the array into subarrays with a sum of `0`, resulting in a total penalty of `0`.
   - Otherwise, the minimum penalty is `n - 2 * neg`. This formula essentially calculates the number of characters that cannot be paired to form a subarray with a sum of `0`.

### Verification with Test Cases
Let's verify the program with the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `n = 1`, `s = '+'`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: `a = [1]`, cannot form a subarray with sum `0`, penalty is `1`.

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `s = '-----'`
   - Output: `5`
   - Explanation: `a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`, cannot form subarrays with sum `0`, penalty is `5`.

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `n = 6`, `s = '+-+-+-'`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: `a = [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]`, can be split into `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])`, penalty is `0`.

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `n = 10`, `s = '--+++++++-'`
   - Output: `4`
   - Explanation: `a = [-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]`, can be split into `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [-1])`, penalty is `4`.

5. **Test Case 5**:
   - Input: `n = 20`, `s = '+---++++-+++++---++-'`
   - Output: `4`
   - Explanation: `a = [1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, -1]`, can be split into multiple subarrays with minimal penalty, resulting in `4`.

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty based on the described strategy. It correctly handles all the test cases.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
