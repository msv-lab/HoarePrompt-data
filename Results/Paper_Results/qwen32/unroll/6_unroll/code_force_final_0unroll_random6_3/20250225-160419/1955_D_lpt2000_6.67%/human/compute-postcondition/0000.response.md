The code snippet provided only reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `nabors`. No other variables are affected or modified by this line of code. Therefore, the initial state remains largely unchanged except for the addition of the `nabors` variable.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5; a is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6, inclusive; b is a list of m integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6, inclusive; The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `nabors` is an input integer.**
