You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the provided program is correct, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Initial Counters:**
   - It initializes a `Counter` for the first `m` elements of `a` (denoted as `cnt_aa`).
   - It initializes a `Counter` for the array `b` (denoted as `cnt_bb`).

3. **Intersection and Difference Counters:**
   - It calculates the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` (denoted as `D`), which gives the common elements and their minimum counts.
   - It calculates the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D` (denoted as `E`), which gives the elements in `a` that are not in `b` or have excess counts.
   - It calculates the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D` (denoted as `C`), which gives the elements in `b` that are not in `a` or have excess counts.

4. **Counting Good Subsegments:**
   - It initializes `tot` as the sum of the values in `D`, which represents the number of matching elements in the initial subsegment.
   - It checks if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k` and sets `fnd` to 1 if true, otherwise 0.
   - It then slides the window across the array `a`:
     - For each element `out_aa` that is sliding out of the window and `in_aa` that is sliding into the window:
       - It updates `D`, `E`, and `C` to reflect the removal of `out_aa` and the addition of `in_aa`.
       - It recalculates `tot` as the sum of the values in `D`.
       - It checks if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k` and increments `fnd` if true.

5. **Output:**
   - For each test case, it prints the number of good subsegments, `fnd`.

The program uses a sliding window approach with counters to efficiently count the number of matching elements in each subsegment of `a` of length `m`. This approach ensures that the solution is efficient, with a time complexity of O(n + m) per test case, which is suitable given the problem constraints.

The logic for updating the counters and checking the number of matching elements is correct based on the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct.
