Output State: **Each test case contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array a, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5; `t` is an input integer.**

This means that the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the integer input, and all other initial conditions remain unchanged.
