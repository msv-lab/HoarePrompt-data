The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, if `n` is 2, it outputs the minimum of the two integers. If `n` is greater than 2, it finds and outputs the maximum median value among all subarrays of length 3 within the list.
