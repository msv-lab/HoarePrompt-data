Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum possible value that Mocha can achieve by repeatedly applying the described operations. The program only considers medians of subarrays of length 3, which is not sufficient to guarantee that the maximum possible value is found.

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
5
1 3 5 7 9
```

Expected Output:
```
7
```

Explanation of expected output:
- Mocha can choose the interval (l, r) = (1, 5). The median of the subarray [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] is 5. After this operation, the array becomes [5, 5, 5, 5, 5].
- However, Mocha can also choose the interval (l, r) = (2, 4). The median of the subarray [3, 5, 7] is 5. After this operation, the array becomes [1, 5, 5, 5, 9].
- Then Mocha can choose the interval (l, r) = (1, 4). The median of the subarray [1, 5, 5, 5] is 5. After this operation, the array becomes [5, 5, 5, 5, 9].
- Finally, Mocha can choose the interval (l, r) = (1, 5). The median of the subarray [5, 5, 5, 5, 9] is 5. After this operation, the array becomes [5, 5, 5, 5, 5].

But the optimal strategy is to choose the interval (l, r) = (2, 4) first, then (l, r) = (1, 5), which results in the array [7, 7, 7, 7, 7] with the median 7 being the maximum possible value.

However, the provided program will only consider subarrays of length 3 and will incorrectly output 5 for this test case.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases correctly.
