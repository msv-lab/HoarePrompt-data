To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, we need to analyze the loop and understand what it does in each iteration.

The loop runs `t` times. In each iteration:
1. It reads a new value for `n`, which is a positive integer.
2. It reads three new strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
3. It calls a function `func_1(n, a, b, c)` and appends the result to the `results` list.

After `t` iterations, the loop will have read `t` sets of inputs and appended `t` results to the `results` list.

The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop, and `results` will contain the results from all `t` iterations.

Given the initial state, the final state will be:
- `n` will be the value read in the last iteration.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the strings read in the last iteration.
- `t` will remain unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `results` will be a list containing the results from each of the `t` iterations.

Output State: **`n` is the number of characters in the last set of strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are the strings from the last iteration. `a`, `b`, and `c` are the strings from the last iteration. `t` is unchanged. `results` is a list containing the results from each of the `t` iterations.**
