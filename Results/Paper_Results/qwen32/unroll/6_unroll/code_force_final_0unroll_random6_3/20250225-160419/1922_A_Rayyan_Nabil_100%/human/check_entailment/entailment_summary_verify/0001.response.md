### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the program is correct based on the given problem description and function summaries.

#### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine if there exists a template string `t` of length `n` such that:
- Both strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
- String `c` does not match the template `t`.

The matching rules are:
- If the `i`-th character of `t` is lowercase, then the `i`-th character of `a` and `b` must be the same as the `i`-th character of `t`.
- If the `i`-th character of `t` is uppercase, then the `i`-th character of `a` and `b` must be different from the lowercase version of the `i`-th character of `t`.
- String `c` must not match the template `t` under the same rules.

#### Program Analysis

The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(n, a, b, c)`: This function checks if there is at least one position `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If such a position exists, it returns 'YES', indicating that a suitable template exists. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
2. `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, and then uses `func_1` to determine if a suitable template exists. It collects the results and prints them.

#### Function Summary

The function summary for `func_2` is incorrect. The summary states that `func_2` computes and prints the number of positions at which the corresponding characters in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` are all the same. However, the actual behavior of `func_2` is to determine if there exists a template `t` that matches `a` and `b` while not matching `c`.

### Correctness Analysis

The logic of `func_1` is flawed. The function checks if there is a position `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. However, this does not guarantee that a suitable template exists that matches `a` and `b` while not matching `c`.

For a template `t` to exist:
1. For each position `i`:
   - If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `t[i]` must be `a[i]` (lowercase).
   - If `a[i] != b[i]`, then `t[i]` must be an uppercase letter that is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
2. String `c` must not match the template `t`.

The current implementation does not consider all these conditions. It only checks if there is a position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, which is not sufficient.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem based on the given requirements. The logic in `func_1` is too simplistic and does not account for all the necessary conditions to determine if a suitable template exists.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
