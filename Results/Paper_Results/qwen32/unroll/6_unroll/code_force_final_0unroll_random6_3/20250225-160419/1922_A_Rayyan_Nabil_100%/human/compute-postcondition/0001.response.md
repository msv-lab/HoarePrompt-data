The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `results`. None of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `t`) are affected by this code. Therefore, the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `t` remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `t` is an input integer, `results` is an empty list.**
