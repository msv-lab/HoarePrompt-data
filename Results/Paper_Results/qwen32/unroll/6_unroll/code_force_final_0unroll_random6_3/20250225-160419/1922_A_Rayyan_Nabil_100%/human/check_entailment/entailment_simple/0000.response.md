### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. The template `t` can have lowercase and uppercase letters. A lowercase letter in `t` must match exactly the same letter in `a` and `b`, while an uppercase letter in `t` must match a different letter in `a` and `b`.

The provided program checks if there exists at least one position `i` where the characters of `a` and `b` do not match the character of `c` at the same position. If such a position exists, it means we can construct a template that satisfies the conditions: we can use an uppercase letter in the template for that position, which will match `a[i]` and `b[i]` (since they are different from `c[i]`), and an appropriate lowercase letter for other positions where `a[i]` and `b[i]` match `c[i]`.

The function `func_1` iterates through each character position `i` of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. If it finds a position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, it returns `'YES'`. If no such position is found, it returns `'NO'`.

The function `func_2` handles the input and output for multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1` for each set of strings and collecting the results.

### Correctness:

The logic in the program correctly identifies whether there exists a template `t` that matches `a` and `b` but not `c` by checking if there is at least one position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If such a position exists, it is possible to construct a template that meets the conditions.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Response:

Correctness: **True**
