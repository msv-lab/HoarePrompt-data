Output State: **The output state consists of t lines, each containing either 'Yes' or 'No' based on the condition that if the second last character of the second string (b) is '<', it prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The values of t, n, a, and b are not preserved after the loop execution, but t lines of output are produced as per the described logic.**
