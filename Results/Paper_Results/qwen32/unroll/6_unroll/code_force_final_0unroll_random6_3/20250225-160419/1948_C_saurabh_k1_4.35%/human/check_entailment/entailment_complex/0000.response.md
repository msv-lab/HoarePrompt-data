**Reasoning:**

The program's logic is based on a specific condition related to the second row's second-to-last character. The program checks if the second last character of the second row (`b[n - 2]`) is '<'. If it is, the robot cannot reach the destination `(2, n)` and the program outputs "No". Otherwise, it outputs "Yes".

However, this logic does not fully capture the problem's requirements. The robot's movement depends on a sequence of moves and the arrows in the grid. The problem specifies that the robot must move to the right or down from the starting position `(1, 1)` and then follow the arrows. The critical point is whether the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)` considering all possible sequences of moves and arrows.

The given program only checks a single condition without simulating the robot's path through the grid. This condition is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the destination in all cases. Therefore, the program is not correct based on the problem description.

**Correctness: False**
