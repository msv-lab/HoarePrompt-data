Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n). The program only checks if the second-to-last cell in the second row points to the left (`<`). If it does, the program incorrectly concludes that the robot cannot reach the target cell (2, n). However, the robot can still reach the target cell (2, n) even if the second-to-last cell in the second row points to the left, depending on the rest of the grid configuration. The program needs to simulate the robot's movement according to the rules provided in the problem description to correctly determine if the robot can reach the target cell.
