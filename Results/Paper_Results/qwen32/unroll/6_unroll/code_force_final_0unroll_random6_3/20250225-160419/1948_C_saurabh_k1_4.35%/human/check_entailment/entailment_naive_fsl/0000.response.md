Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given grid and movement rules. The logic in the program is too simplistic and does not account for the actual movement and arrow-following behavior described in the problem.

The program only checks if the second last character of the second row is '<'. If it is, the program outputs 'No', otherwise it outputs 'Yes'. This is clearly insufficient as it does not consider the actual path the robot can take, including the robot's ability to move up and down and follow the arrows.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
2
4
>>><
>><<
```
The robot can start at (1, 1) and move right to (1, 2), then follow the '>' to (1, 3), then move down to (2, 3), and finally follow the '>' to (2, 4). So the output should be 'YES'. However, the given program will output 'NO' because the second last character of the second row is '<'.

Thus, the program is incorrect for this case and potentially many others.
