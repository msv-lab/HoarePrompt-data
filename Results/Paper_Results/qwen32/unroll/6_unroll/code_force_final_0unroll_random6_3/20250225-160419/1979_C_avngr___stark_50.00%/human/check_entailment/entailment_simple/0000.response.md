### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine a way to distribute bets on multiple outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received for any single winning outcome, given multipliers for each outcome.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.

2. **Calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM)**: The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k`. This is done by multiplying all the multipliers together (`m = m * k[i]`).

3. **Determine Initial Bets**: The program then determines the initial bets by dividing the LCM by each multiplier (`c.append(int(m / k[i]))`). This results in a list `c` where each element is the LCM divided by the corresponding multiplier.

4. **Calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**: The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the list `c` using the `func_1` function. This GCD is then used to normalize the bets by dividing each element of `c` by this GCD.

5. **Check Feasibility**: The program checks if the sum of the normalized bets is less than the normalized LCM (`sum(c) < m / hcf`). If this condition is met, the bets are printed; otherwise, `-1` is printed.

### Analysis:

- **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the multipliers ensures that the bets calculated using `c.append(int(m / k[i]))` are multiples of the necessary factors to ensure the condition is checked correctly.

- **Normalization**: Dividing by the GCD ensures that the bets are minimized while maintaining the necessary condition for the problem.

- **Feasibility Check**: The condition `sum(c) < m / hcf` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets and checks the feasibility of the solution. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
