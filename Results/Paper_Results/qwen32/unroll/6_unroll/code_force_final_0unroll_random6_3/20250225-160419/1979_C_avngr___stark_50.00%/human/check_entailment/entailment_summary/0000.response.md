Reasoning:
The program is designed to find a way to distribute the bets such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i` by multiplying all `k_i` together. It then creates a list `c` where each element is the LCM divided by the corresponding `k_i`. This ensures that if a particular outcome wins, the total amount of coins bet multiplied by `k_i` will be the LCM, which is the smallest number that is a multiple of all `k_i`.

The program then calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the list `c` and divides each element in `c` by this GCD to simplify the numbers, ensuring that the bets are as small as possible while maintaining the condition that the total bet is less than the returned amount for any winning outcome.

The program checks if the sum of the simplified bets is less than the LCM divided by the GCD. If it is, the program outputs the bets; otherwise, it outputs -1, indicating that no valid distribution exists.

The program seems to correctly implement this logic, and the execution summary confirms that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the GCD of a list of numbers. The program's approach is sound and should work for the given problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
