### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine how to distribute the bets on different outcomes such that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.

2. **Calculating the Product:**
   - The program calculates the product `m` of all multipliers `k`.

3. **Calculating Bet Distribution:**
   - For each outcome `i`, the program calculates `c[i]` as `m / k[i]`. This is essentially the product of all multipliers except `k[i]`.

4. **Simplifying the Distribution:**
   - The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the list `c` and divides each element of `c` by this GCD to simplify the bet distribution.

5. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the simplified bet distribution is less than `m / hcf`. If the sum is less, it prints the simplified bet distribution; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Analysis:

- **Product Calculation (`m`):** The product `m` represents the total amount that would be received if each outcome had a multiplier of 1 (which is not possible, but it serves as a reference).

- **Bet Distribution (`c[i]`):** The bet on each outcome `i` is set to `m / k[i]`. This ensures that if outcome `i` wins, the total received (`k[i] * c[i]`) is exactly `m`, which is the sum of all bets.

- **Simplification Using GCD:** Dividing each `c[i]` by the GCD of all `c[i]` values simplifies the bet distribution while maintaining the ratio.

- **Feasibility Check:** The condition `sum(c) < m / hcf` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bet distribution. The condition `sum(c) < m / hcf` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome, which is the requirement of the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
