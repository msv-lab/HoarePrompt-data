Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description, code, and function summary. We'll focus on the correctness of the logic and the conditions used in the program.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to distribute bets \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) on \( n \) outcomes such that the total bet \( \sum x_i \) is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome \( k_i \cdot x_i \) for \( i = 1, 2, \ldots, n \).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n`.

2. **Calculating the Product of Multipliers:**
   - It calculates the product `m` of all multipliers `k_i`. This is a common multiple that can be used to determine the bets.

3. **Determining Bets:**
   - It then calculates the bets `c_i` for each outcome as `c_i = m / k_i`. This ensures that if the i-th outcome wins, the returned amount `k_i * c_i` equals `m`.
   - It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all `c_i` values to simplify the bets while maintaining the ratio.
   - It divides each `c_i` by the GCD to get the simplified bets.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - It checks if the sum of the simplified bets `Î£c_i` is less than `m / GCD`. If this condition holds, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The core logic of the program is to find bets that satisfy the condition \( \sum x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \) for all \( i \). By setting \( x_i = m / k_i \), it ensures that \( k_i \cdot x_i = m \) for all \( i \). Simplifying the \( x_i \) values by their GCD does not change the ratio but ensures the bets are as small as possible while still satisfying the condition.
- The check `if sum(c) >= m / hcf` is incorrect. The correct check should be if the total bets are less than the minimum return, which is `m / k_max` where `k_max` is the maximum multiplier. However, the condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf` is actually checking if the total bets are greater than or equal to the minimum return which is incorrect. The correct condition should be `if sum(c) >= m / hcf / min(k)`, but since `m / hcf` is already the minimum return for the simplified bets, the condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf` is correct as it stands because `m / hcf` is the minimum return for the simplified bets.
- However, the condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf` is not sufficient to ensure that the total bets are less than the return for each individual outcome. The correct condition should be checked against the smallest possible return which is `m / k_max` where `k_max` is the maximum multiplier. But since the problem guarantees that there is always a solution if it exists, and the simplified bets are derived from the product of all multipliers divided by each multiplier and then simplified, the condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf` is indeed correct in the context of the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets or determine that no such bets are possible under the given constraints.

Final: **True**
