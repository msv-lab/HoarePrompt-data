Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. The first integer `t` in the list represents the number of test cases. Following `t`, there are pairs of lines for each test case: the first line in each pair is an integer `n` representing the number of outcomes, and the second line contains `n` integers representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome is winning. The function returns the GCD of the initial value `t` and all the numbers in `numbers[1:]`.**
