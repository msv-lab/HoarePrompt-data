The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`, which iterates over `numbers[1:]`. For the loop to execute, `numbers[1:]` must contain at least one element. Given the context, `numbers[0]` contains the number of test cases `t`, and the subsequent elements are the test cases themselves. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1, meaning `numbers` must have at least 2 elements (the first being `t` and the second being the start of the first test case).

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers where the first integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, and `t` is at least 1, so `numbers` has at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in the list which starts the first test case**
