Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Let's break down the problem requirements and the logic of the given program to understand why it is incorrect.

### Problem Requirements:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Analysis of the Given Program:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\). It initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to \(n\). It then enters a loop where it calculates `countmins` and `g` in a specific manner and updates `ans` based on these calculations. The loop continues until `count` exceeds `m`.

However, the logic used to update `ans` and the conditions under which the loop breaks do not correctly reflect the problem's requirements. The given program does not properly check the condition that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for all pairs \((a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be using a heuristic or approximation that does not guarantee the correct count of valid pairs.

### Correct Approach:
A correct solution would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given ranges and checking the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\). This can be optimized using properties of gcd and lcm, but the given program does not follow such a method.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
