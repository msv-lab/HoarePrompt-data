You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m`. It then calculates and prints an integer value `ans` based on the provided `n` and `m`. The calculation involves iterating and updating a count and a value `g` until a certain condition is met, and the final result for each test case is printed as an integer.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions given in the problem description. Let's analyze the code:

1. The program starts by initializing `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`. This initialization seems off because it does not consider pairs where `b` is 1, and it starts counting from `count = 2` which means it skips the case where `b = 1`.

2. The loop runs while `count` is less than or equal to `m`. Inside the loop, it calculates `countmins` as `count - 1` and `g` as `n / count`. It then checks if `g` is less than `countmins`, and if so, it breaks out of the loop. This condition doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.

3. The code then calculates `g -= countmins` and `ans += g / count + 1`. These calculations do not correctly reflect the logic needed to count the valid pairs (a, b) where `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

4. The final result `ans` is printed as an integer.

To illustrate why the code is incorrect, let's consider a simple test case:

For `n = 3` and `m = 5`, the valid pairs are:
- (1, 1)
- (2, 1)
- (2, 2)
- (3, 1)
- (3, 3)

Total valid pairs = 5.

However, the provided code will not correctly compute this for all cases, especially when `b` is greater than 1. The logic for counting the pairs is flawed, and the code does not correctly handle the conditions specified in the problem description.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
