Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them. The logic in `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, which is not a sufficient condition for forming another rectangle.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:
- If the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles, one of the dimensions of the new rectangle will be the same as one of the dimensions of the original rectangle (either `a` or `b`), and the other dimension will be the sum of half of the other dimension (if it is even) or the dimensions cannot be rearranged into a new rectangle if it is odd.

The correct logic should be:
- If `a` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two `a/2 x b` rectangles and form a `b x a` rectangle.
- If `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two `a x b/2` rectangles and form an `a x b` rectangle, which is the same as the original, or form a `b/2 x 2a` rectangle if rearranged.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, it is impossible to form another rectangle.

Here is the corrected function:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    return 'Yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'No'
```
This function checks if either dimension is even, which is the correct condition for forming another rectangle.
