Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect based on the problem description. The function `func_1(a, b)` only checks if `b` is even and returns 'yes' or 'no' accordingly. However, the problem requires determining if Bob can form a different rectangle by cutting the `a x b` rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.

From the problem statement, we can deduce that Bob can form a different rectangle if and only if at least one of the dimensions (`a` or `b`) is even. This is because:
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, the only way to cut the rectangle is into two smaller rectangles with one dimension being 1, which will result in rectangles that can only form the original rectangle when rearranged.
- If either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles in such a way that they can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

Thus, the correct logic should check if either `a` or `b` is even. The provided function only checks if `b` is even, which is insufficient.

Correctness: **False**
