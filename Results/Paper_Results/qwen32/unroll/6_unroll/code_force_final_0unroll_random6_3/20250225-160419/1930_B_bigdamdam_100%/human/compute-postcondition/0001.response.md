To understand the output state, let's break down the code step by step.

1. The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - `n` is the length of the list `p`, and it is read from the input.
   - `p` is initialized as a list of zeros with length `n`.
   - `ind` is initially set to `n`, and it is used to fill the even indices of `p` in descending order starting from `n` and decrementing by 2.
   - After filling the even indices, `ind` is reset to `1 + n % 2` (which is 1 if `n` is even and 2 if `n` is odd) and used to fill the odd indices of `p` in ascending order starting from `ind` and incrementing by 2.
   - The list `p` is then printed.

Let's see how `p` is constructed for a given `n`:
- For even `n`, the even indices are filled with `n, n-2, n-4, ..., 2` and the odd indices are filled with `1, 3, 5, ..., n-1`.
- For odd `n`, the even indices are filled with `n, n-2, n-4, ..., 3` and the odd indices are filled with `2, 4, 6, ..., n-1, 1`.

Given the initial state and the code, the output state after all iterations will be a series of lists `p` for each test case, where each list `p` is constructed as described above.

Since the output is a series of lists and not a single state, the output state for each test case can be described as follows:

Output State: **For each test case, the list `p` is constructed such that the even indices are filled with descending values starting from `n` and the odd indices are filled with ascending values starting from `1 + n % 2`.**

However, if we need to describe the final state in a more structured format, we can say:

Output State: **For each test case, the list `p` is constructed with even indices filled in descending order from `n` and odd indices filled in ascending order starting from `1 + n % 2`.**

This description captures the essence of how the list `p` is constructed for each test case.
