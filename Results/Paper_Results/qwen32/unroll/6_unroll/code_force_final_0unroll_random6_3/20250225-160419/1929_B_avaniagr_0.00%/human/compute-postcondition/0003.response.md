Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. It calculates and outputs an integer value for each test case based on the given conditions: if `k` is less than `4n - 3`, it outputs `(k // 2 + k % 2)`, if `k` is equal to `4n - 2`, it outputs `1` more than the previous result, and if `k` is equal to or greater than `4n - 3`, it outputs `2 * n`.**
