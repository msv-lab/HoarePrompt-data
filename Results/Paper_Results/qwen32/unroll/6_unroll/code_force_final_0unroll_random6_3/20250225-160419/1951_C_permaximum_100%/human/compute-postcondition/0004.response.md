The code snippet provided initializes a variable `price_increase` to 0. The values of other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `prices`, `pq`, `total_cost`, and `tickets_bought`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9), `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list, `total_cost` is 0, `tickets_bought` is 0, `price_increase` is 0.**
