The code snippet creates a list of tuples called `pq` where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index. The list `pq` is constructed by iterating over the `prices` list using `enumerate`, which provides both the index and the value of each element.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9), `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list.**
