Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether Sasha can guarantee to win any number of coins based on the given rules and conditions. The logic used in the program is flawed and does not properly simulate the betting strategy needed to guarantee that Sasha can reach any desired number of coins `n`.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Strategy Simulation**: The program attempts to simulate a betting strategy by incrementally calculating the minimum number of coins `s` required after a sequence of losses. However, the way it calculates `s` does not correctly reflect the betting strategy described in the problem statement.

2. **Betting Strategy**: The problem requires a specific betting strategy where Sasha bets 1 coin if he has won the previous bet or if it's his first bet. If he has lost the previous bet, he bets twice the previous bet amount. This strategy ensures that Sasha can recover from a series of losses and continue increasing his coins.

3. **Recovery from Losses**: The program does not correctly account for the recovery process after a series of losses. It simply adds a fixed amount to `s` based on the number of consecutive losses allowed (`x`), which does not reflect the actual betting and recovery process.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to analyze whether Sasha can guarantee reaching any number of coins `n` by simulating the betting strategy or using a mathematical approach to determine the feasibility of the strategy.

Here's a corrected approach:

- **Key Insight**: If `k > 2`, Sasha can always recover from a series of losses and continue increasing his coins. This is because the winnings from a win are significantly higher than the losses from consecutive losses.
- **Special Case**: If `k == 2`, Sasha can only recover from a single loss at a time. Therefore, he needs to have enough initial coins to cover the worst-case scenario of `x` consecutive losses.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        if k > 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            # For k == 2, Sasha needs to have at least 2^x coins to cover x consecutive losses
            required_coins = (1 << x)  # 2^x
            print('YES' if a >= required_coins else 'NO')

func()
```

This corrected code properly handles the different cases based on the value of `k` and determines whether Sasha can guarantee reaching any number of coins `n`.
