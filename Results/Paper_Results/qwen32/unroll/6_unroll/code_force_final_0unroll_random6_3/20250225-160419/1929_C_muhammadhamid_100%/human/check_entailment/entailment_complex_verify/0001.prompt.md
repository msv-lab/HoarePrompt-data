You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of three integers k, x, and a, where 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9. There are t test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.

    #State: a sequence of 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case, based on the comparison of `a` and the calculated `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. For each test case, it calculates a value `s` based on the given constraints and prints 'Yes' if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, otherwise it prints 'No'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

Sasha wants to know if he can guarantee that he can reach any amount of coins `n` by placing bets in a casino with specific rules:
- If he wins a bet, he gets `y * k` coins (his coins increase by `y * (k - 1)`).
- If he loses a bet, he loses `y` coins.
- He can't lose more than `x` times in a row.
- He starts with `a` coins.

The goal is to determine if Sasha can reach any amount of coins `n` by strategically placing bets, given the constraints.

### Solution Analysis

The given solution tries to determine if Sasha can guarantee reaching any amount of coins by simulating a worst-case scenario where he loses `x` times in a row and then needs to recover.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:
1. **Initialization**: For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.
2. **Simulation of Worst-Case Scenario**:
   - It initializes `s` (the minimum number of coins required to guarantee reaching any amount) to 1.
   - It then simulates `x` consecutive losses, updating `s` to account for the coins needed to recover from these losses.
   - For each loss, it updates `s` as `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`. This formula is intended to represent the minimum number of coins needed to recover from the losses.
3. **Comparison**: It then checks if the initial amount of coins `a` is greater than or equal to `s`. If `a >= s`, it prints "YES", indicating that Sasha can guarantee reaching any amount of coins. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Verification

To verify the correctness of the solution, let's consider the logic behind the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`:
- When Sasha loses `x` times in a row, he loses `y1 + y2 + ... + yx` coins, where `yi` is the amount he bet on the `i`-th loss.
- To recover from these losses, he needs to place bets such that the total winnings from wins are greater than or equal to the total losses.
- The formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` is an attempt to calculate the minimum `s` such that Sasha can recover from `x` consecutive losses, but it's not entirely correct.

### Correctness

The provided solution does not correctly simulate the worst-case scenario and the recovery process. The formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` does not accurately represent the minimum number of coins needed to recover from `x` consecutive losses.

For example, consider the test case `k = 2`, `x = 1`, `a = 1`:
- In this case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. If he loses, he won't be able to place any more bets, so he can't guarantee reaching any amount of coins.
- The solution incorrectly prints "YES" for this case.

Therefore, the solution is incorrect.
