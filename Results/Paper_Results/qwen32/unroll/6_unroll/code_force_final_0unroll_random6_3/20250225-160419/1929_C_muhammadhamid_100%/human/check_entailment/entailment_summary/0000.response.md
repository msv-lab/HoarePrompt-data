### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining whether Sasha can guarantee to have at least `n` coins for any integer `n` given the rules of the casino. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the worst-case scenario for Sasha's losses and whether he can recover from those losses.

The provided program calculates a value `s` which represents the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to guarantee that he can win any number of coins, considering the maximum number of consecutive losses `x` and the multiplier `k` for winning bets.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:
1. For each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`.
2. It initializes `s` to 1, representing the minimum bet Sasha can make.
3. It iterates `x` times (representing the maximum number of consecutive losses), updating `s` as `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`. This formula reflects the recovery process after each loss:
   - `s // (k - 1)` represents the number of coins Sasha would have after winning a bet if he had bet `s` coins.
   - Adding 1 ensures that Sasha can make a new bet after recovering.
4. Finally, it checks if Sasha's initial number of coins `a` is at least `s`. If so, it prints 'Yes', indicating that Sasha can guarantee to have any number of coins. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

The logic in the program correctly models the worst-case scenario and checks if Sasha can recover from the maximum number of consecutive losses `x` and still guarantee to win any number of coins.

### Correctness: **True**
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can guarantee to have any number of coins given the constraints, and the execution summary aligns with this logic.
