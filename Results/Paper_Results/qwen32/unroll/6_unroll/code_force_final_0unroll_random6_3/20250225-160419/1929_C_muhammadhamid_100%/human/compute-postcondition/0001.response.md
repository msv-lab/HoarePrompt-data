To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the given loop. The loop processes each test case, calculates a value `s` based on the provided `k`, `x`, and `a`, and then prints 'Yes' if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, otherwise it prints 'No'.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. **Initialization**: For each test case, the variables `k`, `x`, and `a` are read from the input.
2. **Calculation of `s`**:
   - `s` is initialized to 1.
   - A nested loop runs `x` times. In each iteration, `s` is updated using the formula:
     \[
     s = s + \left\lfloor \frac{s}{k-1} \right\rfloor + 1
     \]
3. **Comparison and Output**:
   - After the nested loop, the program checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`.
   - It prints 'Yes' if the condition is true, otherwise it prints 'No'.

The initial state consists of `t` test cases, each with values `k`, `x`, and `a`. After processing all test cases, the output state will consist of `t` lines, each either 'Yes' or 'No', depending on the comparison of `a` and `s` for each test case.

Since the output of the program is a series of 'Yes' or 'No' responses for each test case, the output state can be described as a sequence of these responses.

Output State: **a sequence of 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case, based on the comparison of `a` and the calculated `s`.**
