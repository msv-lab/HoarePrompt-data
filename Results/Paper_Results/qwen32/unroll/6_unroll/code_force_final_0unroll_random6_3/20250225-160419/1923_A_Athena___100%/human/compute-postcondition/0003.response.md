Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) and a list of `n` integers (each either 0 or 1 with at least one 1 present). For each test case, the function returns the index (0-based) of the first occurrence of 1 in the list.**
