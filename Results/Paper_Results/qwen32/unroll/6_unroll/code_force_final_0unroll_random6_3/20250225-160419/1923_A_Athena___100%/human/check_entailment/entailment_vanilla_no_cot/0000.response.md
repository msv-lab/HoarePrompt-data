Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them. The current implementation only counts the number of free cells within the range of the first and last chip, which does not account for the optimal way to move the chips to form a contiguous block.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the positions of the chips and calculate the minimum number of moves required to bring all chips together. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Collect positions of all chips
        chip_positions = [i for i in range(n) if a[i] == 1]
        
        # Calculate the median position of the chips
        median_pos = chip_positions[len(chip_positions) // 2]
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of moves
        res = sum(abs(pos - median_pos) for pos in chip_positions)
        
        print(res)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version calculates the median position of the chips and then computes the total number of moves required to bring all chips to the median position, which is the optimal strategy to minimize the total number of moves.
