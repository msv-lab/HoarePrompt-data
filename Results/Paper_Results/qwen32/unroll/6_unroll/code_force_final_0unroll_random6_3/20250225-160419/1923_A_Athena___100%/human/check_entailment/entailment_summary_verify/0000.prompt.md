You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of binary integers (0s and 1s) with at least one 1. For each test case, it counts and prints the number of 0s between the first and last occurrence of 1 in the list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block. The current implementation simply counts the number of free cells between the first and last chip, but it does not account for the optimal way to move the chips.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

**Example Input:**
```
1
9
0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- We have chips at positions 2, 3, 7, and 8.
- We need to move the chips at positions 7 and 8 to form a single block.
- The optimal way is to move the chip from position 7 to position 4 and the chip from position 8 to position 5.
- This results in a total of 3 moves.

**Current Program Output:**
The program will count the free cells between the first and last chip (positions 2 and 8), which are 5 free cells. However, the correct answer should be 3, as explained above.

**Why the Program is Incorrect:**
The program does not consider the optimal way to move the chips. It simply counts the number of free cells between the first and last chip, which does not necessarily give the minimum number of moves required to form a single block of chips.

To fix the program, we need to consider the positions of all chips and calculate the minimum number of moves required to bring them together optimally. This involves calculating the cost of moving each chip to all possible positions and choosing the position with the minimum total cost.
