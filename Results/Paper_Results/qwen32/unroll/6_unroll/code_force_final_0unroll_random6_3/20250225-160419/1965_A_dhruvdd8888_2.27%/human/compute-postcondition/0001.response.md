Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from input; `nums` is a set of strings, each representing a number from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The variable `nums` is now a set containing the split strings from the input. The values of `t` and `N` remain unchanged.
