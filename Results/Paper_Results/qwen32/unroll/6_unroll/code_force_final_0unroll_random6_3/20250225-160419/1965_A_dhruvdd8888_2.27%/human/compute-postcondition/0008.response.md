Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from input; `nums` is a list of integers, sorted in ascending order, that were originally represented as strings in the input set, and the length of `nums` is not equal to 1. Additionally, the length of `nums` is not equal to 2.**
