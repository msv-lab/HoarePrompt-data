You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    nums = set(input().split())
    nums = sorted(map(int, nums))
    if (len(nums) == 1) :
        return print('Alice')
        #The program returns Alice
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from input; `nums` is a list of integers, sorted in ascending order, that were originally represented as strings in the input set, and the length of `nums` is not equal to 1.
    if (len(nums) == 2) :
        return print('Bob')
        #The program returns None after printing 'Bob'
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from input; `nums` is a list of integers, sorted in ascending order, that were originally represented as strings in the input set, and the length of `nums` is not equal to 1. Additionally, the length of `nums` is not equal to 2.
    nums.insert(0, 0)
    cd = 0
    for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
        if nums[i + 1] - nums[i] == 1:
            cd += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from input; `nums` is a list of integers, sorted in ascending order starting from 0, and the length of `nums` is not equal to 1 or 2; `cd` is the count of consecutive pairs of integers in `nums` starting from the beginning that have a difference of 1.
    if (cd & 1) :
        return print('Bob')
        #The program prints 'Bob' and returns None
    else :
        return print('Alice')
        #The program returns 'Alice'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It performs operations based on predefined inputs (t, n, and a list of integers). Depending on the conditions met, it either returns the string 'Alice', returns `None` after printing 'Bob', prints 'Bob' and returns `None`, or returns the string 'Alice'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns Alice

Case_2: The program returns None after printing 'Bob'

Case_3: The program prints 'Bob' and returns None

Case_4: The program returns 'Alice'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
