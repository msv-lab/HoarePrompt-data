Reasoning:

The provided Python program is intended to solve the problem of finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting any contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array. The final result should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Let's analyze the correctness of the provided functions:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is correctly implemented to take an integer as input and return the remainder when that integer is divided by \(10^9 + 7\). This is in line with the problem's requirement of outputting the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The purpose of this function is to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within the given array.
   - The function seems to be an attempt at implementing Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum. However, the implementation has several issues:
     - The function incorrectly appends the `max_segment` and `new_segment` to `segments_variants` in a way that does not correctly track the maximum sum subarray.
     - The logic for handling negative numbers and resetting the `new_segment` is flawed.
     - The function always returns `[7, 4]` regardless of the input, which is incorrect.
   - Given that the function is supposed to find the maximum subarray sum, it should return the correct maximum sum value, not a fixed list `[7, 4]`.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function is not used in the provided code snippet. It appears to be a placeholder or an incomplete implementation, as it does not perform any operations and always returns `0`.

Given the issues with `func_2`, the program does not correctly compute the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations. The function `func_2` should be corrected to properly find the maximum subarray sum.

Thus, the program as provided is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
