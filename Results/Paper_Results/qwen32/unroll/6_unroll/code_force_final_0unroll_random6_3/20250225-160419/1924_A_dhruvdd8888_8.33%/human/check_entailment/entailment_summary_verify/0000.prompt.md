You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

    s = input()
    us = set((chr(i + 97) for i in range(k)))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
    if ps >= n:
        return print('YES')
    print('NO')
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, `m`, and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if there are at least `n` sequences of `k` distinct characters in the string `s`. If such sequences exist, it prints 'YES'. If not, it prints 'NO' and then, for each missing sequence, it prints a constructed string that includes the last characters of found sequences, a missing character from the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and padding with 'a' to meet the length requirement of `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Logic Flaw in Subsequence Checking**:
   - The program attempts to find subsequences by keeping track of characters in a set `win` and clearing it once it contains all `k` characters. This does not correctly ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are checked.
   - The program does not generate or check all possible subsequences of length `n` in `s`. Instead, it only checks if a sequence of `k` characters is present in `s` and then attempts to construct a non-existent subsequence.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Non-Existent Subsequences**:
   - When the program determines that not all subsequences of length `n` are present, it constructs a non-existent subsequence incorrectly. For example, it might not generate the lexicographically smallest subsequence that is missing.
   - The program's approach to generating a non-existent subsequence is flawed. For instance, it appends characters to `ans` without ensuring it forms a valid subsequence of length `n`.

3. **Example of Incorrect Output**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     2 2 3
     abb
     ```
   - The program might output:
     ```
     NO
     aa
     ```
   - However, the correct output should be:
     ```
     NO
     aa
     ```
   - The program's logic might fail to correctly identify that "aa" is missing and instead might output an incorrect string.

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `n` is large or when `s` contains few characters.
   - For example, if `n` is 26 and `k` is 26, the program would need to check all possible strings of length 26, which is computationally infeasible with the current approach.

To correct the program, a more robust approach would be to generate all possible strings of length `n` and check if each one is a subsequence of `s`. This can be done using a backtracking or recursive approach to generate the strings and a helper function to check for subsequences.

Given the current implementation, it fails to meet the problem's requirements in several cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
