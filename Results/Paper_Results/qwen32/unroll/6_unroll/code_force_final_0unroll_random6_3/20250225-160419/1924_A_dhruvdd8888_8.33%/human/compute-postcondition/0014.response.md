Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` for each of the `t` test cases. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers representing constraints on the problem, and `m` is an integer representing the length of the string `s`. The string `s` consists only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The function prints 'YES' for each test case.**
