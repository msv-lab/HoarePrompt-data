You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

def func():
    ans_list = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        ans = a[0]
        res = n - 1
        for i in range(n - 1):
            dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
            if dif == 0:
                res -= 1
            if dif != 0:
                if k >= dif * (i + 1):
                    ans += dif
                    k -= dif * (i + 1)
                    res -= 1
                else:
                    ans += k // (i + 1)
                    if i != 0:
                        res += k % (i + 1)
                    k = 0
                    break
                if k == 0:
                    break
        if k != 0:
            ans += k // n
            res += k % n
        ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1)
        ans += res
        ans_list.append(ans)
    for a in ans_list:
        print(a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of card types `n`, a number of coins `k`, and a list of integers representing the initial count of each card type. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the distribution of coins among the card types, aiming to maximize the minimum number of cards of any type by using the coins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum score as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze why it is incorrect:

1. **Logic Error in Calculating Maximum Score**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the maximum score by sorting the list of card counts and then distributing the additional cards (k) to minimize the differences between the counts of cards.
   - However, the approach taken in the program does not guarantee the maximum number of permutations of [1, 2, ..., n] in any subarray of length n.
   - The final calculation of the score (`ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`) is incorrect and does not align with the problem's requirements.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Coins**:
   - After distributing the coins to minimize differences, the program adds the remaining coins to the smallest pile and then calculates the score, which does not maximize the number of permutations.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Consider the following test case:
     ```
     1
     3 4
     1 1 1
     ```
   - The correct answer should be 7 (by making the counts [2, 2, 2]).
   - The provided program might not handle this correctly and could output an incorrect score.

4. **General Approach**:
   - The correct approach involves using a greedy strategy to distribute the coins in a way that maximizes the number of permutations of [1, 2, ..., n] in any subarray of length n. This involves balancing the counts of the cards as evenly as possible.

Given these issues, the provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is therefore incorrect.
