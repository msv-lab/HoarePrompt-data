### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

**Problem Analysis:**
- The problem involves a series of slimes with given sizes.
- Each second, a slime can eat its neighbor if it is strictly larger than the neighbor.
- The goal is to determine the minimum number of seconds each slime takes to be eaten or determine if it is impossible.

**Code Analysis:**

1. **Main Loop:**
   - The main loop iterates over the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of slimes `n` and the sizes of the slimes `a`.
   - It calls `func_2` to get the minimum seconds to be eaten for each slime.
   - It also calls `func_2` on the reversed list of slime sizes to account for both directions.
   - It then combines the results of the two calls to `func_2` to get the final answer for each slime.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the position of a given value `x` in a sorted list `a`.
   - If `x` is not found exactly, it returns the position where `x` would fit in the sorted order.
   - If `x` is less than 0, it returns -1.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function calculates the minimum number of seconds required for each slime to be eaten.
   - It initializes `left` as a list of cumulative sums of the slime sizes.
   - It also initializes `last` to keep track of the last different element in the list up to each index.
   - It iterates through the list of slime sizes:
     - If a slime is smaller than the previous one, it can be eaten in 1 second.
     - Otherwise, it calculates a value `x` and uses `func_1` to find the earliest slime that can potentially eat the current slime.
     - It updates the answer for each slime based on the calculated values.

**Correctness Verification:**
- The main loop and the calls to `func_2` ensure that the problem is solved for both directions (left-to-right and right-to-left).
- The use of cumulative sums and binary search in `func_2` helps efficiently determine the earliest slime that can eat the current slime.
- The handling of edge cases, such as when a slime is smaller than the previous one, ensures that the solution is correct.

After analyzing the code, it seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
