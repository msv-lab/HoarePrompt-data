The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `x`. It returns `-1` if `x` is less than 0. If `x` is found in the list `a`, it returns the index of `x` in `a` plus one. Otherwise, it returns the value returned by the function `bl(a, x)`, provided that the element at the index returned by `bl(a, x)` in `a` is not equal to `x`.
