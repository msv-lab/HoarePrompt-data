You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

If `x` is found in the list `a`, it returns the index of `x` in `a` plus one. Otherwise, it returns the value returned by the function `bl(a, x)`, provided that the element at the index returned by `bl(a, x)` in `a` is not equal to `x`.

    #The program returns the list `ans` which is a list of length `n` with elements updated based on the loop conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a list `a` of integers representing the sizes of slimes and an integer `n` representing the number of slimes. It returns a list `ans` of the same length `n`, where each element is calculated based on specific conditions related to the sizes of the slimes and their cumulative sums.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the program does not account for the possibility of a slime eating its neighbor to the right if it is strictly smaller. The logic in the program only considers a slime eating its left neighbor if it is strictly smaller, which is incorrect according to the problem description.

Here is a specific test case that demonstrates the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 1 1
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- The 1st slime can be eaten by the 2nd slime in 1 second.
- The 2nd slime can eat the 1st slime in 1 second or the 3rd slime in 1 second.
- The 3rd slime can be eaten by the 2nd slime in 1 second.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
-1 1 -1
```

**Explanation of Actual Output:**
- The 1st slime cannot be eaten by the 2nd slime because the 2nd slime does not eat to its left.
- The 2nd slime eats the 1st slime in 1 second.
- The 3rd slime cannot be eaten by the 2nd slime because the 2nd slime does not eat to its right.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
