Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the program does not account for the possibility of a slime eating its neighbor to the right if it is strictly smaller. The logic in the program only considers a slime eating its left neighbor if it is strictly smaller, which is incorrect according to the problem description.

Here is a specific test case that demonstrates the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 1 1
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- The 1st slime can be eaten by the 2nd slime in 1 second.
- The 2nd slime can eat the 1st slime in 1 second or the 3rd slime in 1 second.
- The 3rd slime can be eaten by the 2nd slime in 1 second.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
-1 1 -1
```

**Explanation of Actual Output:**
- The 1st slime cannot be eaten by the 2nd slime because the 2nd slime does not eat to its left.
- The 2nd slime eats the 1st slime in 1 second.
- The 3rd slime cannot be eaten by the 2nd slime because the 2nd slime does not eat to its right.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
