Functionality: **The function `func_2` takes a list `a` of integers representing the sizes of slimes and an integer `n` representing the number of slimes. It returns a list `ans` of the same length `n`, where each element is calculated based on specific conditions related to the sizes of the slimes and their cumulative sums.**
