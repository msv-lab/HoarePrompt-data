The code snippet initializes a list named `left` with a single element, `0`. This action does not affect the variables `a` or `n`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and len(a) == n, `left` is a list containing the integer 0.**
