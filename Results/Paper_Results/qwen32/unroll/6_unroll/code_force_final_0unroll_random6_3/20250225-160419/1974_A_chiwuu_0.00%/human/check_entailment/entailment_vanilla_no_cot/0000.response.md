Correctness: **False**

The given program attempts to solve the problem but contains several logical errors and inefficiencies. Let's break down why the program is incorrect:

1. **Calculation of `t`**: The variable `t` is calculated as `b * 2`, which is the total number of 1x1 cells occupied by the 2x2 icons. However, this calculation does not properly account for the fact that each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, not 2. The correct way to calculate the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons is to consider that each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells.

2. **Handling of 2x2 Icons**: The logic to calculate the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons is incorrect. The program attempts to divide `t` by 5, which is not the correct approach because each screen has 15 cells, not 5. The correct approach is to divide the total number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons by 15 and round up if necessary.

3. **Handling of 1x1 Icons**: After calculating the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons, the program attempts to calculate the remaining space for the 1x1 icons. The logic here is also incorrect. The remaining space should be calculated based on the number of cells left after placing the 2x2 icons, and then the number of additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons should be calculated.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = math.ceil((b * 4) / 15)
        # Calculate the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = screens_for_2x2 * 15 - b * 4
        # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        additional_screens_for_1x1 = math.ceil((a - remaining_cells) / 15) if a > remaining_cells else 0
        # Total screens needed
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens_for_1x1
        print(total_screens)

func()
```

This corrected version first calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons, then calculates the remaining cells after placing those icons, and finally calculates the number of additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons. It uses the `math.ceil` function to ensure that any fractional screens are rounded up to the next whole number.
