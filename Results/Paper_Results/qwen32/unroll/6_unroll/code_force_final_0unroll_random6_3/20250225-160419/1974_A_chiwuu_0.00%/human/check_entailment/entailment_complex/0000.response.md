### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program and see if it correctly computes the minimum number of screens needed for each test case.

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 icons `a` and the number of 2x2 icons `b`.

2. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
   - Since each screen is a 5x3 grid (15 cells), the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons alone is calculated as:
     - `t = b * 2` (each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, which is equivalent to 2 "blocks" of 2 cells each).
     - `t = t // 5` if `t % 5 == 0` (if the total number of "blocks" is a multiple of 5, it fits perfectly into the screens).
     - `t = t // 5 + 1` otherwise (if there are leftover "blocks", an additional screen is needed).

3. **Calculating Remaining Cells**:
   - After placing the 2x2 icons, the remaining cells in the screens are calculated as:
     - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` (total cells used by 2x2 icons subtracted from the total cells in `t` screens).
   - If the remaining cells `t1` are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`t1 >= a`), no additional screens are needed.
   - Otherwise, the number of additional screens required for the 1x1 icons is calculated:
     - `t2 = a - t1` (the number of 1x1 icons left to be placed).
     - `t = t + t2 // 15` if `t2 % 15 == 0` (if the remaining 1x1 icons fit perfectly into the screens).
     - `t = t + t2 // 15 + 1` otherwise (if there are leftover 1x1 icons, an additional screen is needed).

### Verification Against Example Test Cases:

Let's verify the program's logic against the first few test cases:

1. **Test Case 1: `1 1`**
   - `b * 2 = 2`, `t = 2 // 5 + 1 = 1` (one screen for the 2x2 icon).
   - `t1 = 15 - 4 = 11` (11 cells left).
   - `t1 >= a` (11 >= 1), so no additional screens are needed.
   - Output: `1`.

2. **Test Case 2: `7 2`**
   - `b * 2 = 4`, `t = 4 // 5 + 1 = 1` (one screen for the 2x2 icons).
   - `t1 = 15 - 8 = 7` (7 cells left).
   - `t1 < a` (7 < 7), so additional screens are needed.
   - `t2 = 7 - 7 = 0` (no additional 1x1 icons needed).
   - Output: `1`.

3. **Test Case 3: `12 4`**
   - `b * 2 = 8`, `t = 8 // 5 + 1 = 2` (two screens for the 2x2 icons).
   - `t1 = 30 - 16 = 14` (14 cells left).
   - `t1 < a` (14 < 12), so additional screens are needed.
   - `t2 = 12 - 14 = -2` (no additional 1x1 icons needed, but the logic accounts for it).
   - Output: `2`.

The logic appears to correctly handle the placement of both 1x1 and 2x2 icons and calculates the minimum number of screens needed for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of screens required for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
