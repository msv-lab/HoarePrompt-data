You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b * 2
        if t % 5 == 0:

    #State: the series of printed values of `t` for each of the `n` test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then calculates and prints a value `t` for each test case based on the given logic, which involves operations including multiplication, division, and conditional checks. The final state of the program is a series of printed values of `t` corresponding to each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem of finding the minimum number of screens required to place the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

### Problem Recap:
- Each screen is a 5x3 grid, so it has 15 cells.
- We have `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons.
- 2x2 icons occupy 4 cells, so `y` 2x2 icons will occupy `4*y` cells.
- The goal is to determine the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads `t`, the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `x` and `y`.

2. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - `t = b * 2`: This line calculates the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons, which is `4*y` but mistakenly calculated as `2*y`.
   - `if t % 5 == 0: t = t // 5 else: t = t // 5 + 1`: This line calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons. However, since `t` was calculated as `2*y` instead of `4*y`, this calculation is incorrect.

3. **Calculating Remaining Cells for 1x1 Icons:**
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`: This line calculates the remaining cells available on the screens used for 2x2 icons for 1x1 icons. However, since `t` was calculated incorrectly, `t1` will also be incorrect.
   - `if t1 >= a: t = t else: t2 = a - t1`: This line checks if the remaining cells are enough for the 1x1 icons. If not, it calculates the number of additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons.
   - `if t2 % 15 == 0: t = t + t2 // 15 else: t = t + t2 // 15 + 1`: This line calculates the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons.

### Conclusion:
The program incorrectly calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons because it mistakenly multiplies `y` by 2 instead of 4. This mistake cascades and affects the entire calculation for the number of screens. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem.
