Reasoning:  
The given program is incorrect based on the problem description and the provided execution summary. Let's break down why:

1. **Initialization and Calculation of `c`**:
   - The variable `c` is initialized as `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`. This calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of the total number of possible pairs `(n * (n - 1) // 2)`. However, the denominator used in the calculation is incorrect. It should be `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` to correctly represent the probability of choosing any specific pair out of all possible pairs.

2. **Calculation of `s`**:
   - The loop `for i in range(k)` calculates `s` as `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`. This formula is incorrect. The correct approach involves calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. The expected value should consider the probability of choosing a specific pair and the increase in friendship value over the excursions.

3. **Accumulating `a`**:
   - The variable `a` accumulates the initial friendship values of all pairs. This part is correct, but it is not sufficient to calculate the expected value correctly.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The final output is `s % M`, which is incorrect based on the above issues in the calculation of `s`.

A correct approach would involve calculating the expected increase in friendship value for each pair and then summing these expected values over all `k` excursions. The correct formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions involves the probability of choosing each pair and the increase in friendship value over the excursions.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
