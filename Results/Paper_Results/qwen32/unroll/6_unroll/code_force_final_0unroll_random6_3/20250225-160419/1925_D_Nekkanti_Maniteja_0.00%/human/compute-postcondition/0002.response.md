Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases. Each test case includes three integers: `n` (number of children), `m` (number of pairs of friends), and `k` (number of excursions). It also accepts `m` lines of three integers each, representing pairs of friends and their initial friendship values. The function processes these inputs and returns the results of the excursions based on the friendship dynamics described.**
