You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with three integers n, m, and k, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5. These represent the number of children, the number of pairs of friends, and the number of excursions, respectively. Following these three integers, there are m lines, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. These represent the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their initial friendship value. It is guaranteed that all pairs of friends are distinct. The sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of children, the number of pairs of friends, and the number of excursions. For each test case, it calculates a value `s` based on the given friendship dynamics and outputs the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Probability**:
   - The probability `c` of choosing any specific pair of friends is calculated as `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`. This is incorrect because `n * (n - 1) // 1` should be `n * (n - 1) // 2` (since there are `n * (n - 1) / 2` possible pairs of children).
   - Therefore, `c` should be `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**:
   - The loop `for i in range(k):` is intended to calculate the expected value, but the formula used inside the loop is incorrect.
   - The expected value for each excursion should consider the probability of selecting a pair of friends and their current friendship value. The provided code does not correctly account for the increasing friendship values over subsequent excursions.

3. **Handling of Non-Friend Pairs**:
   - The code does not correctly handle the scenario where a pair of children are not friends. The expected value should be 0 for non-friend pairs, and the code does not account for this correctly.

4. **Summation of Expected Values**:
   - The summation logic inside the loop is flawed. The expected value for each excursion should be calculated based on the probability of selecting a friend pair and their current friendship value.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required logic to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Here's a simplified example to illustrate the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
1
3 1 3
1 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5
```

**Explanation:**
- There are 3 children and 1 pair of friends with a friendship value of 1.
- The possible pairs are (1,2), (1,3), and (2,3).
- The probability of choosing the friend pair (1,2) is `1/3`.
- The expected value for each excursion is:
  - 1st excursion: `1/3 * 1 + 2/3 * 0 = 1/3`
  - 2nd excursion: `1/3 * 2 + 2/3 * 0 = 2/3`
  - 3rd excursion: `1/3 * 3 + 2/3 * 0 = 1`
- Total expected value: `1/3 + 2/3 + 1 = 5/3 ≈ 1.6667`
- The result modulo `10^9 + 7` is `5`.

The provided program does not correctly compute this expected value, hence it is incorrect.
