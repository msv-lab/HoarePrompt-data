Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Probability**:
   - The probability `c` of choosing any specific pair of friends is calculated as `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`. This is incorrect because `n * (n - 1) // 1` should be `n * (n - 1) // 2` (since there are `n * (n - 1) / 2` possible pairs of children).
   - Therefore, `c` should be `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**:
   - The loop `for i in range(k):` is intended to calculate the expected value, but the formula used inside the loop is incorrect.
   - The expected value for each excursion should consider the probability of selecting a pair of friends and their current friendship value. The provided code does not correctly account for the increasing friendship values over subsequent excursions.

3. **Handling of Non-Friend Pairs**:
   - The code does not correctly handle the scenario where a pair of children are not friends. The expected value should be 0 for non-friend pairs, and the code does not account for this correctly.

4. **Summation of Expected Values**:
   - The summation logic inside the loop is flawed. The expected value for each excursion should be calculated based on the probability of selecting a friend pair and their current friendship value.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required logic to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Here's a simplified example to illustrate the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
1
3 1 3
1 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5
```

**Explanation:**
- There are 3 children and 1 pair of friends with a friendship value of 1.
- The possible pairs are (1,2), (1,3), and (2,3).
- The probability of choosing the friend pair (1,2) is `1/3`.
- The expected value for each excursion is:
  - 1st excursion: `1/3 * 1 + 2/3 * 0 = 1/3`
  - 2nd excursion: `1/3 * 2 + 2/3 * 0 = 2/3`
  - 3rd excursion: `1/3 * 3 + 2/3 * 0 = 1`
- Total expected value: `1/3 + 2/3 + 1 = 5/3 â‰ˆ 1.6667`
- The result modulo `10^9 + 7` is `5`.

The provided program does not correctly compute this expected value, hence it is incorrect.
