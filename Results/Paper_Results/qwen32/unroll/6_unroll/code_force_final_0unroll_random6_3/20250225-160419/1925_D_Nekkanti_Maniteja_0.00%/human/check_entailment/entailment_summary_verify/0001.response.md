### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the function summary provided.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for `k` excursions.
- The expected value is expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and we need to compute \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads `m` lines of input, each containing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\).
   - `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of the number of possible pairs \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(M\).
   - `s` is initialized to 0 to accumulate the sum of expected friendship values.
   - `a` is initialized to 0 to accumulate the sum of initial friendship values of all friend pairs.

3. **Processing Friend Pairs:**
   - The program correctly iterates over the `m` friend pairs, adding their friendship values to `a`.

4. **Calculating Expected Sum:**
   - The program then iterates `k` times, updating `s` in each iteration.
   - The formula used for updating `s` is incorrect. The current formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` does not correctly reflect the expected increase in friendship values over `k` excursions.
   - The expected value should consider the probability of choosing a friend pair and the cumulative increase in their friendship values.

#### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Formula:**
  - The current formula for updating `s` does not accurately model the expected increase in friendship values.
  - The correct approach involves calculating the expected contribution of each friend pair over `k` excursions.

#### Correct Approach:
- For each friend pair `(u, v)` with initial friendship value `f`, the expected contribution to the sum over `k` excursions can be calculated as:
  - The probability of choosing the pair `(u, v)` in any given excursion is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).
  - The expected number of times the pair is chosen in `k` excursions is \(k \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).
  - The expected sum of friendship values for this pair over `k` excursions is the sum of an arithmetic series:
    \[
    \sum_{i=1}^{k \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)}} (f + i - 1) = \frac{k \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)}}{2} \left(2f + k \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)} - 1\right)
    \]
  - This needs to be summed over all friend pairs and then taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the program, particularly the incorrect formula for updating the expected sum of friendship values, the program is not correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
