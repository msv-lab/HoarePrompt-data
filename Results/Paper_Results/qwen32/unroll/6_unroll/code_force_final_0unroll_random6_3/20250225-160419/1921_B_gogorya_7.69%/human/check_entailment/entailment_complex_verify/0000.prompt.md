You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In order to test the hypothesis about the cats, the scientists must arrange
the cats in the boxes in a specific way. Of course, they would like to test
the hypothesis and publish a sensational article as quickly as possible,
because they are too engrossed in the next hypothesis about the phone's
battery charge.

Scientists have n boxes in which cats may or may not sit. Let the current
state of the boxes be denoted by the sequence b_1, \dots, b_n : b_i = 1 if
there is a cat in box number i , and b_i = 0 otherwise.

Fortunately, the unlimited production of cats has already been established, so
in one day, the scientists can perform one of the following operations:

  * Take a new cat and place it in a box (for some i such that b_i = 0 , assign b_i = 1 ). 
  * Remove a cat from a box and send it into retirement (for some i such that b_i = 1 , assign b_i = 0 ). 
  * Move a cat from one box to another (for some i, j such that b_i = 1, b_j = 0 , assign b_i = 0, b_j = 1 ). 

It has also been found that some boxes were immediately filled with cats.
Therefore, the scientists know the initial position of the cats in the boxes
s_1, \dots, s_n and the desired position f_1, \dots, f_n .

Due to the large amount of paperwork, the scientists do not have time to solve
this problem. Help them for the sake of science and indicate the minimum
number of days required to test the hypothesis.

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of boxes.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

The third line of each test case contains a string f of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the minimum
number of operations required to obtain the desired position from the initial
position. It can be shown that a solution always exists.

Note

In the first test case, you can first move the cat from the first box to the
fifth, and then remove the cat from the fourth box.

In the second test case, there is nothing to do — the only cat is already
sitting in the correct box.

In the third test case of input data, it takes three days to place a cat in
each box.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `s` and `f` are strings of length `n`, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and two binary strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n`. It calculates and prints the minimum number of changes required to make the number of '1's in `s1` equal to the number of '1's in `s2`, allowing only changes from '0' in `s1` to '1'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s1` to the desired state `s2` for all possible cases. Specifically, the logic for handling the difference in the number of cats between the initial and final states is flawed.

Let's analyze the problematic part of the code:

```python
hd = a1 - a2
res = abs(a1 - a2)
for i in range(n):
    if hd > 0:
        hd -= 1
        continue
    if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
        res += 1
```

Here, `hd` is the difference between the number of cats in the initial state (`a1`) and the desired state (`a2`). `res` is initialized to the absolute value of this difference, which is the number of cats that need to be added or removed to balance the count. However, the subsequent loop logic is incorrect:

1. If `hd > 0`, it means there are more cats in the initial state than in the desired state. The loop decrements `hd` without considering the actual positions of the cats.
2. If `s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'`, it increments `res` by 1, which is incorrect because it should only add to `res` if there is a cat that needs to be moved or removed, but the condition does not account for the cats that are already in the correct position or the cats that need to be moved to other positions.

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5
11100
00111
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- There are 3 cats in the initial state and 3 cats in the desired state, so no cats need to be added or removed.
- The cats need to be moved from the first two boxes to the last two boxes.
- The minimum number of operations required is 2 (move one cat from box 1 to box 4 and one cat from box 2 to box 5).

However, the provided program will output `3` for this input because it incorrectly counts the number of cats that need to be moved or removed without considering the positions.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
