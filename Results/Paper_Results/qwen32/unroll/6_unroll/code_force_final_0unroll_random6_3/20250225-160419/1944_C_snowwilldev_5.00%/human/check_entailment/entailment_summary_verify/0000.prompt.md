You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        t = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n-1`. It then determines and prints the smallest integer `i` such that either `i` appears exactly once in the list `a` or `i` does not appear at all in the list `a`. If there are at least two such integers, it prints the first one it encounters.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly implements the solution as per the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice starts with an empty array `c`.
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from `a` and deleting them from `a`.
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
- The MEX (minimum excludant) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array.

### Program Analysis:
The program provided is:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        t = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break
```

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Optimal Strategy Not Considered**:
   - The program does not consider the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob.
   - Alice should aim to maximize the MEX, which means she should try to include as many unique elements as possible in `c`.
   - Bob should aim to minimize the MEX, which means he should try to prevent Alice from including unique elements.

2. **Logic Flaw**:
   - The program checks for the count of each element and breaks when it finds two unique elements or a missing element.
   - This logic does not simulate the game's turns and does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob are making strategic choices.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where all elements are the same or where the array is already sorted in a way that affects the MEX calculation.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly simulate the game and does not account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
0 0 1 1 2
```
The optimal game could be:
1. Alice picks `2`, `a = [0, 0, 1, 1]`, `c = [2]`.
2. Bob picks `0`, `a = [0, 1, 1]`, `c = [2]`.
3. Alice picks `1`, `a = [0, 1]`, `c = [2, 1]`.
4. Bob picks `0`, `a = [1]`, `c = [2, 1]`.
5. Alice picks `1`, `a = []`, `c = [2, 1]`.

The MEX of `c = [2, 1]` is `0`. However, the program might not correctly handle this case and could output an incorrect MEX.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**.

The program fails to correctly simulate the game and does not account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.
