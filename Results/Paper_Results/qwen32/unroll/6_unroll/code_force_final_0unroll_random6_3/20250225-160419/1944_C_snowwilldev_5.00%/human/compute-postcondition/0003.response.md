Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n-1`. It then determines and prints the smallest integer `i` such that either `i` appears exactly once in the list `a` or `i` does not appear at all in the list `a`. If there are at least two such integers, it prints the first one it encounters.**
