Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly implements the solution as per the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice starts with an empty array `c`.
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from `a` and deleting them from `a`.
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
- The MEX (minimum excludant) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array.

### Program Analysis:
The program provided is:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        t = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break
```

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Optimal Strategy Not Considered**:
   - The program does not consider the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob.
   - Alice should aim to maximize the MEX, which means she should try to include as many unique elements as possible in `c`.
   - Bob should aim to minimize the MEX, which means he should try to prevent Alice from including unique elements.

2. **Logic Flaw**:
   - The program checks for the count of each element and breaks when it finds two unique elements or a missing element.
   - This logic does not simulate the game's turns and does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob are making strategic choices.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where all elements are the same or where the array is already sorted in a way that affects the MEX calculation.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly simulate the game and does not account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
0 0 1 1 2
```
The optimal game could be:
1. Alice picks `2`, `a = [0, 0, 1, 1]`, `c = [2]`.
2. Bob picks `0`, `a = [0, 1, 1]`, `c = [2]`.
3. Alice picks `1`, `a = [0, 1]`, `c = [2, 1]`.
4. Bob picks `0`, `a = [1]`, `c = [2, 1]`.
5. Alice picks `1`, `a = []`, `c = [2, 1]`.

The MEX of `c = [2, 1]` is `0`. However, the program might not correctly handle this case and could output an incorrect MEX.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**.

The program fails to correctly simulate the game and does not account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.
