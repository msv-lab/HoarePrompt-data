In the provided for loop, the loop variable is `tc` and it iterates over the range of `int(input())`. This means that the loop will execute `int(input())` times, which corresponds to the number of test cases `t`.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to make sure that the input value (which is `t`) is at least 1. The state of `t` is already provided as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), so it is already in a valid range for the loop to execute.

Since the loop variable `tc` is not mentioned in the initial state, we need to set it to the starting value of the range, which is 0, as the loop will start with `tc` being 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration.

Thus, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that the input value `t` is at least 1, which is already satisfied by the problem constraints. The loop variable `tc` should start from 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `tc` is 0**
