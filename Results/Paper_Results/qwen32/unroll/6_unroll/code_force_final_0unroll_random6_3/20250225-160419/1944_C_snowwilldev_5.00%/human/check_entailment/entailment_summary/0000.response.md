### Reasoning:

The given problem requires us to find the MEX of the array `c` after both players, Alice and Bob, play optimally. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it.

The strategy involves:
1. Counting the occurrences of each number in the array `a`.
2. Determining the smallest non-negative integer that either appears exactly once or does not appear at all in the array `a`.

The provided program correctly implements this strategy:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
- It then counts the occurrences of each number using a dictionary `cnt`.
- It iterates through numbers from 0 to `n-1` and checks if the current number appears exactly once or not at all in the array `a`.
- The first such number it encounters is printed, which is the correct MEX based on the described strategy.

The execution summary aligns with the problem's requirements and the program's behavior. It correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer that either appears exactly once or does not appear at all, which is the MEX of the array `c` in this context.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, it is correct.

**Correctness: True**
