Let's examine the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a given "beautiful" array so that it stops being beautiful. An array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly performing the operation of replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`.

### Program Analysis

The provided program seems to be attempting to solve the problem by counting the longest contiguous subsequence of identical numbers and then using this count to determine the answer. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic in the code:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
2. **Initialization**: It initializes `tmp` to the first element of the array, `cnt` to 0, and `ans` to `n`.
3. **Counting Contiguous Subsequences**: The program iterates over the array:
   - If the current element is the same as `tmp`, it increments `cnt`.
   - If the current element is different from `tmp`, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
4. **Final Count Update**: After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time to consider the last contiguous subsequence.
5. **Decision Making**: The program then checks if the array has only one element (`n == 1`) or if the longest contiguous subsequence is the entire array (`ans == n`). If either condition is true, it prints `-1` (indicating that the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements). Otherwise, it prints `ans`.

### Issues in the Program

The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. The main issue is that it does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The logic of counting the longest contiguous subsequence and then using its length does not account for the fact that we need to remove elements in such a way that the resulting array cannot be made uniform through the allowed operations.

### Correctness

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem. It fails to consider the correct approach for determining the minimum number of elements to remove.

Correctness: **False**
