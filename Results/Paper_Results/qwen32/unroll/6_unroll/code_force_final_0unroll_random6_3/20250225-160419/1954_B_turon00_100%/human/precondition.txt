t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. Additionally, the array a is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem definition, and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
