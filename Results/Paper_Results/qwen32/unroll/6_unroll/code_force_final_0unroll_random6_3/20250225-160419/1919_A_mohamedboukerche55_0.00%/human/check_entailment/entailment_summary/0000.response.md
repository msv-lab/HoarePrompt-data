Reasoning:  
The provided program's logic is based on the sum of the coins in both wallets. It correctly determines the winner by checking if the sum `(a + b)` is even or odd. If the sum is even, Bob wins; if the sum is odd, Alice wins. This strategy is derived from the observation that the game's outcome depends on whether the total number of moves available is even or odd. Since each turn removes one coin, and the player who cannot make a move loses, the player who starts (Alice) will win if the total number of coins is odd (giving her an extra move), and Bob will win if the total number of coins is even.

The program reads the input correctly, processes each test case, and prints the expected result based on the sum of `a` and `b`. The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected for each test case.

Since the program's logic aligns with the problem's requirements and the execution summary indicates correct behavior, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
