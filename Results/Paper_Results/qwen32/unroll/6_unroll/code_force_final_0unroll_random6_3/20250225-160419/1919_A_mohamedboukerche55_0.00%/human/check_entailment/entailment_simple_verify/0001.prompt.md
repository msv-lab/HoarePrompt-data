You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()

        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:

        #This is printed: alice
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and a and b are integers with the values from the last iteration of the loop, where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. The sum of a and b is either even or odd.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis

The game can be analyzed as follows:
- Alice and Bob take turns.
- Each turn, a player can either swap wallets or not, and then must remove one coin from their current wallet.
- The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., when both wallets are empty) loses.
- Both players play optimally.

### Key Insight

The game's outcome can be determined by the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins \(a + b\):
- If \(a + b\) is even, Bob wins.
- If \(a + b\) is odd, Alice wins.

This is because the game always ends when the total number of coins reaches 0. If the total number of coins is even, Bob will always be the one to make the last move, and thus Alice will be unable to make a move after that. Conversely, if the total number of coins is odd, Alice will be the one to make the last move, and thus Bob will be unable to make a move after that.

### Program Analysis

Let's look at the provided program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        print('bob  ')
    else:
        print('alice')
```

#### Issues in the Program

1. **Indentation Error**: The `if` statement is incorrectly indented. It should be inside the loop to check each test case individually.
2. **Output Formatting**: The program prints 'bob  ' with two extra spaces, which does not match the expected output format. It should print 'Bob' without extra spaces.
3. **Variable Scope**: The variables `a` and `b` are defined inside the loop but are used outside the loop for the final `if` statement. This means only the last test case's values of `a` and `b` will be considered.

### Corrected Program

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. The corrected version of the program is required to solve the problem as described.
