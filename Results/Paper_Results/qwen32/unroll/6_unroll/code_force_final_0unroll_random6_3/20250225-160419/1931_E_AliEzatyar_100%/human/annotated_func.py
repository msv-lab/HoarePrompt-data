#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing integers. The first integer in each test case is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the number of test cases. Each test case then consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and m (0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break

    return counter
    #The program returns counter which is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `num`, which is a list of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers `n` and `m`, and the second line contains `n` integers. The function iterates over the list `num` in reverse order and counts the number of trailing '0' strings. However, the function always returns `0` regardless of the input values.
