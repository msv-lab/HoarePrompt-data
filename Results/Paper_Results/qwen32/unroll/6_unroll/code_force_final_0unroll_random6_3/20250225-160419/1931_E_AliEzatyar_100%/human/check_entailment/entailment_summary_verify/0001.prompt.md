You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

- Program:
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = input().split()
    total_digits = 0
    zeros = []
    for item in array:
        total_digits += len(item)
        if func_1(item) > 0:
            zeros.append(func_1(item))
    zeros = sorted(zeros, reverse=True)
    subtract_zero = 0
    for i in range(0, len(zeros), 2):
        subtract_zero += zeros[i]
    if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)

def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
    return counter



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `num`, which is a list of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers `n` and `m`, and the second line contains `n` integers. The function iterates over the list `num` in reverse order and counts the number of trailing '0' strings. However, the function always returns `0` regardless of the input values.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Analysis of the Problem

1. **Game Mechanics**:
   - Anna reverses the digits of an integer, removing leading zeros.
   - Sasha concatenates two integers in any order and replaces them with the concatenated result.
   - The game ends when only one integer is left in the list.
   - Sasha wins if the final integer is at least \(10^m\), otherwise Anna wins.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Reversing a number by Anna can potentially reduce the number of digits, especially if there are trailing zeros.
   - Sasha can concatenate numbers to increase the number of digits.
   - The game will always end with one number, and the winner is determined by the number of digits in that number.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, and the list of integers `array`.

2. **Logic for Determining the Winner**:
   - The program calculates the total number of digits in the list.
   - It calculates the number of trailing zeros for each number and stores these counts in the list `zeros`.
   - By sorting `zeros` in descending order and summing every second element, it calculates `subtract_zero`, which represents the total number of digits that can be removed by Anna's optimal play.
   - The program then checks if the difference between the total number of digits and `subtract_zero` is at least `m + 1`. If it is, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

### Correctness of the Program

The program attempts to determine the winner based on the number of digits in the final number. However, there are several issues with the logic:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Digits Removed**:
   - The program assumes that Anna can always remove trailing zeros in an optimal manner. However, this doesn't account for the fact that Sasha can concatenate numbers to potentially negate the effect of Anna's moves.

2. **Sasha's Strategy**:
   - Sasha can strategically concatenate numbers to maximize the number of digits in the final number. The program does not account for this strategy.

3. **Anna's Strategy**:
   - Anna's strategy involves reversing numbers to minimize the number of digits. However, the program's logic for calculating the number of digits removed is too simplistic and does not consider all possible moves.

### Conclusion

Given the above points, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner based on the optimal play of both Sasha and Anna. The program's logic is oversimplified and does not account for the strategic interactions between the players.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
