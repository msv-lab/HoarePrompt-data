Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `num`, which is a list of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers `n` and `m`, and the second line contains `n` integers. The function iterates over the list `num` in reverse order and counts the number of trailing '0' strings. However, the function always returns `0` regardless of the input values.**
