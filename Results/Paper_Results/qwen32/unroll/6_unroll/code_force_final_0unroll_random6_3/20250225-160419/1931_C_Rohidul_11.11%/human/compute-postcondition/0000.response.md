In the provided task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use within the loop. Therefore, the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `t`.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The values of `n` and `a` are defined within each test case and are not directly relevant to the execution of the loop itself. They will be read inside the loop body, so we do not need to adjust them before the loop starts.

Given this, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `t` is greater than or equal to 1. The other variables `n` and `a` do not need to be adjusted as they are part of the input inside the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
