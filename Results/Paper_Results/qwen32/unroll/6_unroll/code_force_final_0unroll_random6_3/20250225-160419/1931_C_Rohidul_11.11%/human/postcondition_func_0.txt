The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the longest contiguous subarray within `a` that is not entirely composed of the same element, unless the entire array is uniform, in which case it returns the length of the array minus one.
