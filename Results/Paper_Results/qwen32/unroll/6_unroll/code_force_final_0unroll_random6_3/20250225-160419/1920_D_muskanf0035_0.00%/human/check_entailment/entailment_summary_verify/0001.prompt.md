You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

Note

In the first test case:

  * After the first operation a = [1] ;
  * After the second operation a = [1, 2] ;
  * After the third operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2] ;
  * After the fourth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] ;
  * After the fifth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] .

In the fourth test case, after all operations a = [1, 2] .

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:

        else:

    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result

        (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]

        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        print(*result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of operations and queries. For each test case, it processes a list of operations and a list of queries, and then outputs the results of the queries based on the operations.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code step by step with respect to the problem description.

### Problem Summary
1. We have an initially empty array `a`.
2. We perform `n` operations in a specific order:
   - Type 1: Append an integer `x` to the end of `a`.
   - Type 2: Append `x` copies of the current array `a` to the end of `a`.
3. We answer `q` queries, each asking for the `k`-th element of the final array `a`.

### Key Points to Consider
- The array `a` can grow very large due to the Type 2 operation.
- The problem constraints allow the size of the array to be up to \(10^{18}\) elements, which makes it impractical to store the entire array in memory.
- We need to efficiently determine the `k`-th element of the array without constructing the entire array.

### Analysis of the Provided Code

#### Function `func_1`
- This function is responsible for processing the operations and answering the queries.
- It initializes an empty list `array` and iterates over the operations.
- For Type 1 operations, it appends the given integer to `array`.
- For Type 2 operations, it attempts to extend `array` by adding `x` copies of the current `array` to itself. However, this approach is incorrect because:
  - Extending the array in this manner will result in a memory overflow due to the large size constraints.
  - It does not handle the large `x` values efficiently.

#### Function `func_2`
- This function reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads `n`, `q`, the list of operations, and the list of queries.
- It prints the results returned by `func_1`.

### Correctness Evaluation
- The provided code attempts to construct the entire array, which is not feasible given the constraints.
- The code does not handle the large `x` values in Type 2 operations efficiently.
- The code does not provide a correct solution for the problem, as it will fail to handle large inputs due to memory limitations.

### Conclusion
The provided program is incorrect because it tries to construct the entire array, which is not feasible given the problem constraints. A correct solution would need to determine the `k`-th element without constructing the entire array, possibly by keeping track of the structure of the array and using mathematical calculations to find the required element.
