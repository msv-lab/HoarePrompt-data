n is a positive integer representing the number of operations, operations is a list of n tuples where each tuple contains two integers b and x (b is either 1 or 2, and x is a positive integer with constraints based on the type of operation), and queries is a list of q integers (where q is the number of queries) representing the positions to be queried in the final array a. The size of the final array a after all operations does not exceed 10^18. The sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
