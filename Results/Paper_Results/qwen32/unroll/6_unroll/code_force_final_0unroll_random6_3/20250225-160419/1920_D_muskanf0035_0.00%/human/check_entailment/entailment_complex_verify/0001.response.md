### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotations to evaluate the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Summary:
1. **Initial Array**: Starts empty.
2. **Operations**:
   - **Type 1**: Append integer `x` to the end of the array.
   - **Type 2**: Append `x` copies of the current array to the end of the array.
3. **Queries**: For each query, determine the `k`-th element of the final array.

#### Key Points:
- **Constraints**: The size of the array can grow up to \(10^{18}\), making it impractical to store the entire array in memory.
- **Efficiency**: The solution must efficiently determine the `k`-th element without constructing the entire array.

#### Analysis of the Provided Code:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**: Starts with an empty list `array` and an empty list `result`.
   - **Processing Operations**:
     - **Type 1**: Appends the given integer `x` to `array`.
     - **Type 2**: Extends `array` by adding `x` copies of the current `array` to itself. This is problematic because:
       - It results in a memory overflow due to the large size constraints.
       - It does not handle large `x` values efficiently.
   - **Handling Queries**:
     - For each query `k`, it appends the element at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` to `result`.
     - This approach is incorrect because it assumes the entire array is constructed, which is not feasible.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, reads `n` (number of operations), `q` (number of queries), the list of operations, and the list of queries.
   - Calls `func_1` and prints the results.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations show the state of the program after processing operations and handling queries.
- However, the annotations do not reflect the correct behavior for large `x` values in Type 2 operations.
- The annotations show that the program attempts to extend the array multiple times, which is incorrect for large inputs.

#### Evaluation:
- The provided code attempts to construct the entire array, which is not feasible given the problem constraints.
- The code does not handle the large `x` values in Type 2 operations efficiently.
- The code does not provide a correct solution for the problem, as it will fail to handle large inputs due to memory limitations.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it tries to construct the entire array, which is not feasible given the problem constraints. A correct solution would need to determine the `k`-th element without constructing the entire array, possibly by keeping track of the structure of the array and using mathematical calculations to find the required element.

**Final: False**
