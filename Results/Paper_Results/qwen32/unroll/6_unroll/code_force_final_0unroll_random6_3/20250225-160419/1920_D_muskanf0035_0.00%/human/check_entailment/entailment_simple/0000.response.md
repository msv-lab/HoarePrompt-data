### Reasoning

Let's analyze the program and the provided example to determine if the program is correct.

#### Program Analysis

The program consists of two main functions:
1. `func_1(n, operations, queries)`: This function handles the logic of the operations and queries.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

#### Key Points in `func_1`
- **Appending Elements**: When `op_type` is 1, the value `x` is appended to the array `array`.
- **Extending Array**: When `op_type` is 2, the current `array` is extended by appending `x` copies of itself. This is done using `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])`, but the loop should be repeated `x` times, which is missing in the given code.
- **Query Handling**: For each query, the function finds the `k`-th element in the final array. Since the array can be very large, the modulo operation `(k - 1) % len(array)` is used to find the correct element in the array.

#### Key Points in `func_2`
- **Input Reading**: It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` (number of operations), `q` (number of queries), the list of operations, and the list of queries.
- **Processing**: It calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the results.

#### Issues in the Provided Code
The main issue lies in the handling of operations of type 2. The current implementation only extends the array once when it should be extended `x` times. Here's the corrected part of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            # Extend the array x times
            array.extend(array * (value - 1))
        
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
        
    return result
```

#### Example Verification
Let's verify the first test case from the example:

- Initial array: `[]`
- Operation 1: Append `1` -> `array = [1]`
- Operation 2: Append `2` -> `array = [1, 2]`
- Operation 3: Extend by `1` copy -> `array = [1, 2, 1, 2]`
- Operation 4: Append `3` -> `array = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`
- Operation 5: Extend by `3` copies -> `array = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`

Queries:
- `1` -> `1`
- `2` -> `2`
- `3` -> `1`
- `4` -> `2`
- `5` -> `3`
- `6` -> `1`
- `14` -> `1`
- `15` -> `2`
- `16` -> `3`
- `20` -> `3`

The output matches the expected result.

### Conclusion

The provided code has a critical issue in the handling of operation type 2, where the array should be extended `x` times instead of just once. After correcting this issue, the program should work as expected. However, based on the provided code without the correction, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
