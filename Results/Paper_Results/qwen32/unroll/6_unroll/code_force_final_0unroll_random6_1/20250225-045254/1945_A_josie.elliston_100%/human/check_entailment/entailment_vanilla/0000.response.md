Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Introverts (a)**: Each introvert must be in a tent alone.
2. **Extroverts (b)**: Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two others.
3. **Universals (c)**: Universals can be in a tent alone, with one other person, or with two others.

### Objective:
- Determine the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.
- If it is impossible to accommodate all participants, return -1.

### Conditions:
- If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, we need to check if the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals to form complete tents of 3.
- If there are insufficient universals to complete the tents for extroverts, it is impossible to accommodate everyone, and the result should be -1.
- Each introvert requires a separate tent.
- The total number of tents is the sum of tents for introverts and the tents for extroverts and universals.

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the provided functions:

#### Function `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`:
- This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
- It checks if the number of extroverts is divisible by 3.
- If not, it checks if the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals to form complete tents of 3.
- If it's not possible, it returns `None` (indicating it's impossible to accommodate everyone).
- Otherwise, it calculates the total number of tents needed using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

#### Function `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`:
- This function calculates the total number of tents needed.
- It first calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
- If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate everyone, so it returns -1.
- Otherwise, it adds the number of tents for introverts (which is equal to the number of introverts) to the result from `func_1`.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Handling Extroverts**: The function `func_1` correctly checks if extroverts can be paired with universals to form complete tents of 3 if the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3.
- **Handling Introverts**: The function `func_2` correctly adds the number of introverts to the result since each introvert requires a separate tent.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles cases where there are no participants (`a = b = c = 0`), only introverts, only extroverts, and various combinations of introverts, extroverts, and universals.
- **Output**: The program correctly outputs the minimum number of tents or -1 if it's impossible to accommodate everyone.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly solves the problem according to the given requirements and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
