You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        arr = []
        k0 = k
        i = 0
        while k:
            if k & 1 == 1:
                arr.append(i)
            k = k >> 1
            i += 1
        ans = []
        c = 0
        for i in arr:
            if c == n - 1:
                ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
                break
            c += 1
            ans.append(1 << i)
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it generates a list `ans` of `n` integers where the first `n-1` elements are powers of 2 corresponding to the set bits in the binary representation of `k`, and the last element is chosen such that the sum of all elements in `ans` equals `k`. The function prints this list for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap
Given integers `n` and `k`, construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that:
1. The sum of the sequence equals `k`: `∑ a_i = k`
2. The number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Binary Representation of `k`:**
   - The program converts `k` to its binary representation and identifies the positions of the 1s.
   - This is done using a while loop that checks each bit of `k` from the least significant bit to the most significant bit.

3. **Constructing the Sequence:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the 1s in the binary representation of `k`.
   - It then initializes an empty list `ans` to store the final sequence.
   - The program iterates over `arr` and constructs the sequence by setting the corresponding bits to 1 (using `1 << i`), while ensuring that the number of elements in `ans` does not exceed `n - 1`.
   - If the sequence is not yet of length `n`, it appends zeros to `ans` to fill the remaining spots.
   - Finally, it ensures that the sum of the sequence equals `k` by adjusting the last element of `ans`.

### Potential Issues

1. **Bitwise OR Maximization:**
   - The goal is to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.
   - The program correctly identifies the positions of the 1s in the binary representation of `k` and sets the corresponding bits in the sequence.
   - However, the program does not ensure that it uses all possible positions of 1s to maximize the bitwise OR. For example, if `k` has a binary representation with a single 1, the program will only set one bit in the sequence, potentially missing opportunities to set other bits to 1 in different numbers to maximize the bitwise OR.

2. **Sum Constraint:**
   - The program ensures that the sum of the sequence equals `k` by adjusting the last element of `ans`.
   - However, the way it constructs the sequence may not always result in a sum of `k` if `n` is larger than the number of 1s in the binary representation of `k`.

### Example Analysis

Let's consider the fourth test case from the example:
- `n = 6`, `k = 51`
- Binary representation of `k` is `110011` (which has 1s at positions 0, 1, 3, and 5).
- The program constructs the sequence as `[1, 2, 8, 32, 0, 0]`, which sums to 43, not 51.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not always construct a sequence that satisfies both conditions (sum equals `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Reasoning: The program does not always construct a sequence that satisfies both conditions (sum equals `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR).
Correctness: **False**
