Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the second type of operation where Jayden appends x copies of the array to the end of the array. The current implementation only appends a single copy of the array to itself, regardless of the value of x. This is incorrect as per the problem description.

Here is the problematic part of the code:

```python
else:
    array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
```

This line should be modified to append `x` copies of the array to itself, not just one copy. The correct implementation should look something like this:

```python
else:
    array.extend(array * (x - 1))  # Appending (x-1) more copies of the array
```

However, even with this fix, the program may still face performance issues due to the way it constructs the array, especially given the constraints. Constructing the array in its entirety for each test case can be inefficient when the array size grows very large (up to \(10^{18}\)).

A more efficient approach involves keeping track of the segments of the array and their respective lengths without fully constructing the array. This way, you can determine the k-th element by navigating through the segments rather than constructing the entire array.
