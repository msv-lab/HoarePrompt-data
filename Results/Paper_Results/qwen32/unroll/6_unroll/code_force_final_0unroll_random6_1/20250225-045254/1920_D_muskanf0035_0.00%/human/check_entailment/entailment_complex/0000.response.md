### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided functions and their behavior against the problem description.

#### Function `func_1`:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty list `array` and an empty list `result`.
2. **Processing Operations**:
    - For each operation in the `operations` list, it checks the type of operation (`op_type`).
    - If `op_type` is 1, it appends the integer `value` to the end of `array`.
    - If `op_type` is 2, it extends `array` by appending `value` copies of the current `array` to itself. This is done using list comprehension.
3. **Processing Queries**:
    - For each query `k` in the `queries` list, it calculates the element at the position `(k - 1) % len(array)` and appends this element to the `result` list.
4. **Return**: The function returns the `result` list, which contains the elements from `array` at the positions specified by the queries.

#### Function `func_2`:

1. **Reading Input**:
    - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q`.
    - It then reads `n` operations and `q` queries.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
    - For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the operations and queries, and prints the result.

### Analysis:

- **Operation Type 1**: Correctly appends the integer to the array.
- **Operation Type 2**: The implementation incorrectly extends the array by appending `value` copies of the current array. However, the provided code actually appends the whole array to itself `value` times, which is not what the problem description requires. The correct approach is to append the current length of the array `value - 1` times, but the given code does not do that. Instead, it appends the entire array `value` times, which changes the behavior of the array construction.
- **Query Handling**: The function correctly handles the queries by using modulo arithmetic to wrap around the array indices.

### Conclusion:

The given code does not correctly implement the array duplication operation as described in the problem statement. The operation of appending `value` copies of the array should be done by appending the array `value - 1` times, not `value` times. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
