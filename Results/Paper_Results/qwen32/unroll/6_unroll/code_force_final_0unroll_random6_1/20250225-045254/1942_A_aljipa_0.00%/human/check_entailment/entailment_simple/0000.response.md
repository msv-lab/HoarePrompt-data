Reasoning: The provided program attempts to solve the problem by generating an array based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case. However, the logic implemented in the program does not correctly address all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **When `k == n`**: The program correctly outputs an array of `n` ones. This is because if `k == n`, all cyclic shifts of the array must be sorted, which is true for an array where all elements are the same (e.g., [1, 1, 1, 1]).

2. **When `k == 1`**: The program outputs an array that is a range from `0` to `n-1` (e.g., [0, 1, 2, 3]). This array has exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is the array itself. This is correct because the cyclic shifts of [0, 1, 2, 3] are [0, 1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 0], [2, 3, 0, 1], and [3, 0, 1, 2], and only the first one is sorted.

3. **When `1 < k < n`**: The program incorrectly outputs `-1`. However, there are valid arrays that can satisfy the condition for these values of `k`. For example, for `n = 3` and `k = 2`, a valid array could be [1, 2, 1], which has two sorted cyclic shifts: [1, 2, 1] and [2, 1, 1].

The program does not handle the case where `1 < k < n` properly. It should generate an array that has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts, which is not addressed by the current logic.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for the general case where `1 < k < n`.

Correctness: **False**
