Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Let's analyze the program and the problem requirements:

1. **Case k = n**: The program correctly outputs an array with all elements equal to 1, which will have all cyclic shifts sorted.
2. **Case k = 1**: The program outputs an array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`. However, this array will have exactly one sorted cyclic shift (the first one), but the problem does not specify that the array must start from 0. A valid solution could be any array where one cyclic shift is sorted and the others are not, such as `[1, 2, 3, ..., n-1, 10^9]`.
3. **Case 1 < k < n**: The program outputs `-1`, which is incorrect. There can be valid arrays that have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. For example, for `n = 3` and `k = 2`, a valid array could be `[1, 2, 10^9]`, which has two sorted cyclic shifts: the first and the last.

Thus, the program needs to be revised to handle the case `1 < k < n` and to ensure that the case `k = 1` produces a valid output. Therefore, the program is not correct for all test cases.
