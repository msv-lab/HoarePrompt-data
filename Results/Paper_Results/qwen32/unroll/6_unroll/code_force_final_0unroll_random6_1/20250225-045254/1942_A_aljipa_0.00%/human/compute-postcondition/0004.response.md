Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` where `1 ≤ k ≤ n`. Based on the values of `n` and `k`, it prints a list of integers. If `k` equals `n`, it prints a list of `n` ones. If `k` equals `1`, it prints a list of integers from `0` to `n-1`. For all other values of `k`, it prints a list containing a single element `-1`.**
