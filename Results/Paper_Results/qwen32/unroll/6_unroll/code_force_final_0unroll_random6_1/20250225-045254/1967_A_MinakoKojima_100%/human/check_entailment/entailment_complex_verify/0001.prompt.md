You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `ans` based on the given inputs. The final state of the program is that it outputs the calculated `ans` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Breakdown:

1. **Objective**: Maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]` after potentially buying up to `k` additional cards.
2. **Inputs**:
   - `n`: Number of distinct card types.
   - `k`: Number of coins to buy additional cards.
   - `a`: Array of `n` integers where `a[i]` is the number of cards with the number `i`.
3. **Constraints**:
   - `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`
   - `0 <= k <= 10^12`
   - `1 <= a[i] <= 10^12`
4. **Output**: For each test case, print the maximum score.

### Program Analysis:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Sorting the array `a` in ascending order.
2. Starting with the smallest count of cards (`a[0]`), it tries to equalize the counts of cards by using the available coins `k`.
3. It calculates the number of additional cards needed to equalize the counts and checks if `k` is sufficient.
4. If `k` is sufficient, it updates the counts and reduces `k` accordingly.
5. If `k` is not sufficient to equalize the counts fully, it distributes the remaining coins optimally.
6. Finally, it calculates the score based on the updated counts of cards.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Approach**: The program's logic for distributing the coins is flawed. It attempts to equalize the counts of cards by using a greedy approach, which does not necessarily lead to the optimal solution. The optimal way to maximize the number of permutations is not considered.
2. **Incorrect Calculation of Score**: The final score calculation is incorrect. The program incorrectly adds the counts and their differences to the score, which does not reflect the number of valid permutations.
3. **Handling of Remaining Coins**: The way the remaining coins are handled after the loop is also incorrect. It does not correctly account for the distribution of these coins to maximize the number of permutations.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly:
1. **Determine the Minimum Cards Needed**: Calculate the minimum number of cards needed to form a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
2. **Calculate Deficit**: Determine the total deficit in cards needed to form a permutation.
3. **Optimal Distribution**: Use the available coins `k` to distribute optimally among the card types to minimize the deficit.
4. **Calculate Score**: The score is the number of complete permutations that can be formed after distributing the coins optimally.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. It fails to maximize the number of permutations and incorrectly calculates the score.
