The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `ans_list`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or the list `a`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `ans_list` is now an empty list, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^12. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^5; `ans_list` is an empty list.**
