You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates a specific value based on these integers and prints the result as an integer.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions specified in the problem description.

Let's analyze the problem and the program:
- The problem requires counting pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).
- The program's logic seems to be attempting to find pairs by iterating through possible values of b and calculating the number of valid a values for each b. However, the logic does not correctly calculate the number of valid pairs.

The program's core logic:
```python
count = 2
ans = n
while count <= m:
    countmins = count - 1
    g = n / count
    if g < countmins:
        break
    g -= countmins
    ans += g / count + 1
    count += 1
```
- This loop seems to be trying to count valid a values for each b, but the calculations inside the loop do not correctly reflect the problem's requirements.

Let's consider a simple test case:
- Input: `n = 2, m = 3`
- Expected output: `3` (pairs are (1,1), (2,1), (2,2))
- The program's output for this input is incorrect.

Let's test the program with the given example inputs:
- Input: `1 1` -> Expected output: `1` -> Program output: `1` (correct for this case)
- Input: `2 3` -> Expected output: `3` -> Program output: `3` (correct for this case)
- Input: `3 5` -> Expected output: `4` -> Program output: `4` (correct for this case)
- Input: `10 8` -> Expected output: `14` -> Program output: `14` (correct for this case)
- Input: `100 1233` -> Expected output: `153` -> Program output: `153` (correct for this case)
- Input: `1000000 1145141` -> Expected output: `1643498` -> Program output: `1643498` (correct for this case)

Even though the program seems to produce the correct output for the given examples, the logic inside the program is not robust and does not guarantee correctness for all possible inputs. The program's logic is not straightforward and may fail for other edge cases that are not covered in the given examples.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Although it may work for the given examples, the underlying logic is flawed and may not work for other inputs.

Correctness: **False**.
