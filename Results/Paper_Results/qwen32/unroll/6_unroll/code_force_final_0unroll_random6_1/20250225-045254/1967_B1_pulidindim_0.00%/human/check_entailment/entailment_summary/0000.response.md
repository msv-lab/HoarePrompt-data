Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The given program attempts to solve this problem by iterating through possible values of \(b\) starting from 2 (since \(b=1\) trivially gives \(n\) valid pairs for any \(a\)) and calculating the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\).

### Program Analysis

The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`. It initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n` (since for \(b=1\), any \(a\) is valid, so there are `n` valid pairs).

The loop runs while `count` is less than or equal to `m`. Inside the loop:
- It calculates `countmins` as `count - 1`.
- It calculates `g` as `n / count`.
- If `g` is less than `countmins`, it breaks out of the loop.
- Otherwise, it updates `g` by subtracting `countmins`.
- It adds `g / count + 1` to `ans`.
- It increments `count` by 1.

Finally, it prints `ans` as an integer.

### Issues in the Program

There are several issues with the provided program that make it incorrect for solving the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**:
   - The program's logic for calculating the number of valid pairs for each \(b\) is incorrect. The calculation of `g` and subsequent steps do not align with the problem requirements.
   - The program does not correctly account for the condition that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly, especially when \(n\) or \(m\) are small or when \(b\) is large.

3. **Mathematical Approach**:
   - The problem requires a more mathematical approach to efficiently determine the number of valid pairs. The provided program's approach does not seem to follow any known algorithm or mathematical reasoning for solving this problem.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect for solving the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
