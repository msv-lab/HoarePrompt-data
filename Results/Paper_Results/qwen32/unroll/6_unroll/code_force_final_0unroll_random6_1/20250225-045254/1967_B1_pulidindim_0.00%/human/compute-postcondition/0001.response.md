To ensure that the for loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `i in range(t)`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1, because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`, and the loop will iterate over this sequence.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.

The state of `t` already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute, as it is specified to be at least 1. There is no need to adjust `t` further. The variable `i` does not need to be explicitly set before the loop starts, as it will be initialized by the `range` function during the first iteration.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts, as it is provided, is sufficient for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4**
