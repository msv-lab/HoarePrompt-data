You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Output

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6. The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^6.
def func():

        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \( 1 \le a \le n \)
2. \( 1 \le b \le m \)
3. \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \)

### Program Analysis:
The provided program uses a loop to iterate over possible values of \( b \) starting from 2 up to \( m \). However, the logic inside the loop does not correctly implement the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:
1. The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
2. For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( m \).
3. It initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to \( n \).
4. It enters a loop that runs while `count` is less than or equal to \( m \).
5. Inside the loop, it calculates `countmins` as `count - 1` and `g` as \( n / count \).
6. It checks if `g` is less than `countmins` and breaks the loop if true.
7. It adjusts `g` by subtracting `countmins` and adds \( (g / count + 1) \) to `ans`.
8. It increments `count` and continues the loop.
9. Finally, it prints `ans` as an integer.

### Issues with the Program:
1. The logic for calculating the number of valid pairs is incorrect. The program does not properly check the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).
2. The initial value of `ans` is set to \( n \), which is incorrect because it does not account for the pairs where \( b = 1 \).
3. The loop and calculations inside the loop do not correctly account for all valid pairs (a, b).

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible values of \( a \) and \( b \) and check if the condition \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) holds. A more efficient approach would involve using mathematical properties and optimizations, but the given program does not implement this correctly.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the program, the program is incorrect for the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
