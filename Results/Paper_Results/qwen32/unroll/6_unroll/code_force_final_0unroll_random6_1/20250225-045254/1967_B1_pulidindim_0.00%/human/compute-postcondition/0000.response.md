`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an integer input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables `n` and `m` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2 · 10^6. The sum of `n` and the sum of `m` over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^6.**
