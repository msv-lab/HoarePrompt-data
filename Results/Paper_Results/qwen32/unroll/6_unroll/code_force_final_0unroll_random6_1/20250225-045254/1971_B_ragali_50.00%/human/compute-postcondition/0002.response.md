Output State: **For each test case, the program will print 'YES' if the string `s` contains more than one unique character. If it does, it will then print a modified version of the string based on the conditions provided. If the string contains only one unique character, it will print 'NO'. The variable `t` will remain unchanged, and `s` will hold the last input string processed by the loop.**
