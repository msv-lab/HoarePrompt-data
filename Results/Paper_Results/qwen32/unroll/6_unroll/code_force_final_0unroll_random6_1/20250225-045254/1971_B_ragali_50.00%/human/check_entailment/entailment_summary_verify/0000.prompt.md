You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        a = set()
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. It prints 'YES' if the string contains more than one unique character; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If the string contains more than one unique character, it also prints a modified version of the string based on specific conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not guarantee that the rearranged string `r` will be different from the original string `s` for all possible inputs. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Single Character Strings**: 
   - If the input string `s` has a length of 1, the code will correctly identify that it is impossible to rearrange the string to be different from itself and print "NO". However, this is already handled correctly in the code.

2. **Strings with All Identical Characters**:
   - If the input string `s` consists of all identical characters (e.g., "aaaaa"), the code correctly identifies that it is impossible to rearrange the string to be different from itself and prints "NO".

3. **Strings with Distinct Characters**:
   - For strings with distinct characters, the code attempts to rearrange the string by splitting it in half and swapping the halves. However, this approach does not guarantee that the rearranged string will be different from the original string for all cases. For example, if the string is already symmetric, the rearrangement may result in the same string.

4. **Strings with Repeated Characters**:
   - For strings with repeated characters, the code attempts to rearrange the string by splitting it in half and swapping the halves. However, this approach may not guarantee that the rearranged string will be different from the original string for all cases. For example, if the string is "xxxxy", the rearrangement may result in the same string.

Here is a specific counterexample where the program does not work correctly:
- Input: "abab"
- Expected Output: "YES\nbaba" or any other permutation of "abab" that is not "abab"
- Actual Output: "YES\nbaba" (or another permutation), but the code may not guarantee this for all cases.

Let's consider the string "abab":
- The code will split the string into "ab" and "ab", and then swap them to get "abab", which is the same as the original string. This is incorrect because the rearranged string must be different from the original string.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not guarantee that the rearranged string will be different from the original string for all possible inputs.
