You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1. There is at least one 1 in each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = 0
        
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: - After all `t` iterations, the output state will be a series of integers, each representing the count of zeros in the middle of the list `a` for each test case, after removing the leading and trailing zeros.
    #
    #Given that the output of the code for each test case is an integer representing the count of zeros in the middle of the list `a` after removing the leading and trailing zeros, the output state after all the iterations will be a sequence of these integers.
    #
    #Since we don't have specific values for `t` and the lists `a` in this problem statement, we cannot provide a concrete sequence of integers. However, the format of the output will be a series of integers, one for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to move chips in such a way that they form a single block without any free cells between them. The minimum number of operations required to achieve this should be calculated for each test case.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list `a` representing the cells (0 for free, 1 for chip).

2. **Initial Cleaning**:
   - The program removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a` using `pop(0)` and `pop()`. This step is correct because leading and trailing zeros do not affect the relative positions of the chips within the block.

3. **Counting Operations**:
   - The program then iterates through the cleaned list `a` and counts the number of zeros. This count represents the number of free cells within the block of chips, which directly translates to the number of operations needed to move the chips to form a contiguous block. This is because each free cell within the block needs to be filled by moving a chip from the right.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the count of operations for each test case.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `8`, `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
   - After cleaning: `1 1 1 0 1 1`
   - Count of zeros: `1`
   - Expected Output: `1`

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `6`, `0 1 0 0 0 0`
   - After cleaning: `1`
   - Count of zeros: `0`
   - Expected Output: `0`

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `6`, `1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - After cleaning: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - Count of zeros: `0`
   - Expected Output: `0`

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `5`, `1 0 1 0 1`
   - After cleaning: `1 0 1 0 1`
   - Count of zeros: `2`
   - Expected Output: `2`

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - Input: `9`, `0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
   - After cleaning: `1 1 0 0 0 1 1`
   - Count of zeros: `3`
   - Expected Output: `3`

The program produces the expected output for all test cases, indicating that it correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to form a contiguous block of chips.

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided example.
