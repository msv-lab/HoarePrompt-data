### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the function summary to ensure the program correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Initial Cleaning**:
   - The program removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a` using `pop(0)` and `pop()`. This step is correct because leading and trailing zeros do not affect the relative positions of the chips within the block.

2. **Counting Operations**:
   - After removing leading and trailing zeros, the program counts the number of zeros in the remaining list. This count represents the number of free cells within the block of chips.
   - The key point here is that each free cell within the block needs to be filled by moving a chip from the right. However, this is not the only way to interpret the problem. The problem requires moving chips to the left until they form a contiguous block, which might involve more operations than just counting the free cells within the block.

3. **Verification with Example**:
   - Let's revisit the first test case:
     - Input: `8`, `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
     - After cleaning: `1 1 1 0 1 1`
     - Count of zeros: `1`
     - Expected Output: `1`
     - Here, the program correctly identifies that one operation is needed to move the chip from the 6th position to the 4th position.

   - Let's consider the fourth test case:
     - Input: `5`, `1 0 1 0 1`
     - After cleaning: `1 0 1 0 1`
     - Count of zeros: `2`
     - Expected Output: `2`
     - Here, the program correctly identifies that two operations are needed to move the chips to form a contiguous block.

However, let's consider a more complex test case to challenge the program:
   - Input: `6`, `1 0 0 1 0 1`
   - After cleaning: `1 0 0 1 0 1`
   - Count of zeros: `3`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Here, the program correctly identifies that three operations are needed to move the chips to form a contiguous block.

Despite the above examples, let's consider another case:
   - Input: `6`, `1 0 0 0 1 1`
   - After cleaning: `1 0 0 0 1 1`
   - Count of zeros: `3`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Here, the program correctly identifies that three operations are needed to move the chips to form a contiguous block.

However, let's consider a more complex case:
   - Input: `6`, `1 0 0 1 1 0`
   - After cleaning: `1 0 0 1 1`
   - Count of zeros: `2`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Here, the program incorrectly identifies that two operations are needed, but the correct number of operations is three. The chip at position 4 needs to move to position 2, and the chip at position 5 needs to move to position 3, and the chip at position 6 needs to move to position 4, which requires three operations.

### Conclusion:
The function summary and the program's logic correctly count the number of free cells within the block of chips, but this does not necessarily translate to the minimum number of operations required to form a contiguous block. The program fails in cases where the free cells are not consecutively positioned within the block of chips.

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final: **False**
