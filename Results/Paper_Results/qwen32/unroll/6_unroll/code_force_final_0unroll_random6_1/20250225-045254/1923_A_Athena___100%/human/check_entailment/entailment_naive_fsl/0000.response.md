Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block of chips without any free cells between them. Specifically, it simply counts the number of free cells within the range of the first and last occupied cells, which does not account for the optimal way to move the chips.

Let's consider a few test cases to demonstrate the issue:

**Test Case 1:**
```
Input:
4
0 1 0 1

Output:
1 (Expected)
Actual Output:
1 (Correct in this case, but not a good indicator)

Explanation:
The program correctly identifies that there is one free cell between the two chips and counts it as one operation.
```

**Test Case 2:**
```
Input:
5
1 0 1 0 1

Output:
2 (Expected)
Actual Output:
2 (Correct in this case, but not a good indicator)

Explanation:
The program correctly identifies that there are two free cells between the chips and counts them as two operations.
```

**Test Case 3:**
```
Input:
6
1 0 1 0 0 1

Output:
2 (Expected)
Actual Output:
3 (Incorrect)

Explanation:
The program counts all three free cells between the first and last chip, but the optimal solution involves moving the rightmost chip to the second free cell from the left, resulting in only two operations.
```

**Test Case 4:**
```
Input:
7
1 0 0 1 0 0 1

Output:
3 (Expected)
Actual Output:
4 (Incorrect)

Explanation:
The program counts all four free cells between the first and last chip, but the optimal solution involves moving the rightmost chip to the second free cell from the left, resulting in only three operations.
```

The program fails to consider the optimal movement of chips to minimize the number of operations. It simply counts the number of free cells within the range of the first and last occupied cells, which is not always the minimum number of operations required.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for at least some cases, and the Correctness is **False**.
