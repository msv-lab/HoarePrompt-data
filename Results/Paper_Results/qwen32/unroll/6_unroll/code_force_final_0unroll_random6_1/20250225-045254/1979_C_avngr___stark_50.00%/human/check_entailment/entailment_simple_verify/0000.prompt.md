You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    3
    
    6 3 2
    
    5
    
    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's carefully analyze the problem description and the provided code.

### Problem Description Recap
- We need to distribute coins among `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
- For each test case, we are given `n` and a list of multipliers `k`.
- We need to find `n` integers `x_i` such that:
  - The sum of all `x_i` is less than `k_i * x_i` for each `i`.
- If no such distribution is possible, output `-1`.

### Code Analysis
The provided code attempts to solve this problem by:
1. Calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k`.
2. Using the LCM to determine the bets `x_i` as `m / k[i]` where `m` is the LCM.
3. Dividing these bets by their greatest common divisor (GCD) to simplify them.
4. Checking if the sum of the simplified bets is less than the simplified LCM. If not, it outputs `-1`.
5. Otherwise, it outputs the simplified bets.

### Potential Issues
Let's consider the logic and edge cases:
- The code calculates the LCM of the multipliers, which is a valid approach to ensure that the bets are integers.
- The bets are then divided by their GCD to simplify them, which is also a valid step.
- The condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf:` checks if the total bet is less than the simplified LCM. This condition is correct for ensuring that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

### Testing with Example Inputs
Let's test the code with the provided example inputs to see if it works correctly.

1. **Test Case 1:**
   ```
   3

   ```
   - LCM of 3, 2, 7 is 42.
   - Bets are `42/3`, `42/2`, `42/7` which are 14, 21, 6.
   - Simplified by GCD (which is 1) results in 14, 21, 6.
   - Sum of bets is 41, which is less than 42.
   - Output: `14 21 6` (Note: The code outputs `27 41 12`, which is also correct as it satisfies the condition).

2. **Test Case 2:**
   ```

   - Simplified by GCD (which is 1) results in 627, 487, 1463, 258, 487, 337.
   - Sum of bets is 3649, which is less than 4389.
   - Output: `627 487 1463 258 487 337` (Note: The code outputs `1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071`, which is also correct as it satisfies the condition).
