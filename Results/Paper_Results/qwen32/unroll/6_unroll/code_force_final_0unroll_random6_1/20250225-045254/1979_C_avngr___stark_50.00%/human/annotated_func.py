#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is the number of test cases, followed by t pairs of lines. Each pair consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for each outcome. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: - `hcf` will be the GCD of the initial value `t` and all the subsequent elements in `numbers`.
    #
    #Thus, the output state in the required format is:
    #
    #Output State:
    return hcf
    #The program returns hcf, which is the GCD of the initial value t and all the subsequent elements in numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `numbers` where the first element `t` is the number of test cases, followed by additional elements. It calculates and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list, starting with `t`.
