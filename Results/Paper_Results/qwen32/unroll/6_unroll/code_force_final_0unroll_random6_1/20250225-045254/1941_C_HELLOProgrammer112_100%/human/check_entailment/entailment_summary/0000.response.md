Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to determine the minimum number of characters that need to be removed from a string to make it beautiful by eliminating the substrings "map" and "pie". However, the current implementation does not correctly address the problem requirements.

The main issue with the provided program is that it simply counts occurrences of "map" and "pie" and subtracts the occurrences of "mapie", which does not give the correct number of deletions required. The program does not account for overlapping substrings or the fact that removing one character might affect the presence of other substrings.

For example, in the string "mapie", the program counts one "map" and one "pie", and one "mapie", so it would output 0, but actually, only 2 deletions are needed to make the string beautiful.

To solve the problem correctly, a dynamic programming approach or another method to handle overlapping and dependent deletions would be necessary. The current program does not handle these cases and thus does not provide the correct output for all scenarios.

Correctness: **False**
