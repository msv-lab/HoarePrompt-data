Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. The logic in the program simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and subtracts the occurrences of the overlapping substring "mapie". However, this approach does not account for the actual deletions required to remove the substrings "map" and "pie" from the string.

For example, consider the test case:
```
1
11
pppiepieeee
```
The string "pppiepieeee" contains the substring "pie" twice, but the program will output `2`, which is incorrect. To make the string beautiful, we need to remove at least 2 characters to eliminate both occurrences of "pie". However, the program does not handle the actual removal of characters and their overlaps correctly.

A correct approach would involve using dynamic programming or a greedy method to find the minimum deletions required to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie" from the string. The provided program is too simplistic and does not address the problem requirements accurately.
