Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to generate a permutation of numbers from 1 to n such that there do not exist two distinct indices i and j (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

### Program Analysis

The provided program does the following:

1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.
3. Inside `func_1`, it generates a list of numbers from 1 to n.
4. It reverses the elements at even indices of the list.
5. It prints the modified list.

Let's consider how this approach might work for different values of n:

#### Example 1: n = 4
- Initial list: [1, 2, 3, 4]
- After reversing elements at even indices (0, 2, ...): [4, 2, 3, 1]
- This results in the permutation: [4, 2, 3, 1]

Let's check if this permutation satisfies the condition:
- There are no pairs (i, j) where p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

#### Example 2: n = 3
- Initial list: [1, 2, 3]
- After reversing elements at even indices (0, 2, ...): [3, 2, 1]
- This results in the permutation: [3, 2, 1]

Let's check if this permutation satisfies the condition:
- There are no pairs (i, j) where p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

### General Case Analysis

The provided program's approach of reversing the elements at even indices does not guarantee that the condition will always be satisfied for all possible values of n. To prove this, let's consider a larger example:

#### Example 3: n = 6
- Initial list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
- After reversing elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...): [6, 2, 4, 4, 3, 1]
- This results in the permutation: [6, 2, 4, 4, 3, 1]

However, this list is not a valid permutation because it contains duplicate elements (4 appears twice). This violates the requirement that the permutation must consist of distinct integers from 1 to n.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly generate a valid permutation for all values of n due to the following reasons:
1. It does not guarantee that the condition of no two distinct indices i and j satisfying p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} will always be met.
2. It can produce invalid permutations with duplicate elements.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
