The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (length of list `a`), `m` (length of list `b`), `k` (an integer), `a` (a list of `n` integers), and `b` (a list of `m` integers). It returns the total number of times, during a sliding window process of size `m` over list `a`, that the sum of the minimum counts of common elements between the current window and list `b` is at least `k`.
