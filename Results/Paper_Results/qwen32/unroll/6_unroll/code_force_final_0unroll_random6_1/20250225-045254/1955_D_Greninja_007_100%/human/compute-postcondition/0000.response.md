The code snippet `cb = Counter(sorted(b))` sorts the list `b` and then creates a `Counter` object from the sorted list, counting the occurrences of each integer in `b`. This means that `cb` will be a dictionary-like object where the keys are the unique integers from the sorted list `b`, and the values are the counts of each integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5. `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6, inclusive. `b` is a list of m integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6, inclusive. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `cb` is a Counter object representing the counts of each integer in the sorted list `b`.**
