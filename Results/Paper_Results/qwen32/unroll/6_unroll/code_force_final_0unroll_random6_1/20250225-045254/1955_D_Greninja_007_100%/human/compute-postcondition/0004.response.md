Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6, inclusive; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6, inclusive; `cb` is a Counter object representing the counts of each integer in the sorted list `b`; `ca` is a Counter object representing the counts of each integer in the sorted list of the first `m` elements of `a`; `ans` is 0; `sm` is the sum of the minimum counts of each integer that appears in both `ca` and `cb`, and `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
