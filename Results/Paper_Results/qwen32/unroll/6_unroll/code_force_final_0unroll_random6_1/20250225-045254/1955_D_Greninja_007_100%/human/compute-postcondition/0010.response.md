Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer representing the length of list `a`), `m` (an integer representing the length of list `b`), `k` (an integer), `a` (a list of `n` integers), and `b` (a list of `m` integers). It returns the total number of times during a sliding window process that the sum of the elements in the window (referred to as `sm`) is at least `k`.**
