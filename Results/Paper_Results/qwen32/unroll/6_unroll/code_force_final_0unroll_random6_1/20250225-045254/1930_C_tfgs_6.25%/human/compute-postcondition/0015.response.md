Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It modifies the list by adding the index plus one to each element, then constructs a new list `ans` that includes all unique elements from the modified list `a` in descending order, with additional elements inserted between consecutive elements of `a` based on specific conditions. Finally, it prints the elements of `ans`.**
