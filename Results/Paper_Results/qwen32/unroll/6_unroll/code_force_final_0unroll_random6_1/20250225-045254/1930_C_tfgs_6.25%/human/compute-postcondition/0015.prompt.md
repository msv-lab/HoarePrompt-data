You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is the original `a_i` plus `i + 1`.
    counter = Counter(a)
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
    #State: `t` is unchanged; `n` is unchanged; `a` is unchanged; `counter` has adjusted counts based on the elements added to `ans`; `cnt` is reduced by the number of elements added to `ans` beyond `len(a)`; `ans` contains all elements from `a` plus additional elements inserted between consecutive elements of `a` based on the conditions specified.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: `t` is unchanged; `n` is unchanged; `a` is unchanged; `counter` is unchanged; `cnt` is unchanged; `ans` contains all elements from `a` plus `cnt` additional elements, each being one less than the previous element.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: all elements of `a` followed by `cnt` additional elements, each being one less than the previous element (where the additional elements start from `a[-1] - 1` and decrement by 1 for each subsequent element)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes each test case and returns an output based on the values in the list `a`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
