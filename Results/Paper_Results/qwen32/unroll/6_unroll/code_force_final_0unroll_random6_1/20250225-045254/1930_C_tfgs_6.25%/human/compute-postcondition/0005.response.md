The code snippet `a = list(set(a))` removes duplicates from the list `a` by converting it to a set and then back to a list. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `counter` directly, but it does change the list `a` by ensuring all elements are unique.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of unique integers derived from the original list `a` where each integer `a_i` is the original `a_i` plus `i + 1`; `counter` is a Counter object that holds the frequency of each element in the modified list `a`.**

Natural language: The list `a` now contains only unique elements, while `t`, `n`, and `counter` remain unchanged.
