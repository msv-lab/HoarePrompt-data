### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic and steps in the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Problem Recap:
1. **Initialization**: We start with an array `a` of length `n` and an empty set `S`.
2. **Operations**:
   - Select an index `i` such that `1 ≤ i ≤ |a|`.
   - Insert `a_i + i` into set `S`.
   - Delete `a_i` from `a`.
3. **Result Construction**:
   - After `n` operations, `a` will be empty, and `S` will contain unique values.
   - Construct array `b` by sorting `S` in decreasing order.
4. **Objective**:
   - Find the lexicographically largest possible `b`.

#### Code Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The code reads `t` (number of test cases) and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of array `a`) and the array `a` itself.

2. **Transformation**:
   - For each element `a_i` in `a`, it adds `i + 1` to it, transforming `a` to `a_i + i`.
   - This step is correct as it ensures each element in `a` is adjusted according to its index.

3. **Set Construction**:
   - It uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each element in the transformed `a`.
   - It then converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in decreasing order.
   - This step is correct as it ensures that `S` is a set of unique values and sorted in decreasing order.

4. **Reconstruction of `b`**:
   - It initializes an empty list `ans` to store the final array `b`.
   - It iterates over the sorted set `a` (which now represents `S`).
   - For each element in `a`, it checks if there are any gaps between consecutive elements and fills those gaps by inserting values that are one less than the previous element.
   - It ensures that the number of inserted elements does not exceed the count of the previous element in the original `a`.
   - Finally, it appends any remaining elements (if `cnt` is not zero) that are one less than the last element in `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - The final list `ans` is printed, which represents the lexicographically largest possible `b`.

#### Verification:

- The code correctly transforms the array `a` according to the problem statement.
- It ensures that the resulting set `S` contains unique values and is sorted in decreasing order.
- The reconstruction of `b` ensures that it is lexicographically largest by filling gaps between consecutive elements in `S`.
- The use of `Counter` ensures that the correct number of elements are inserted between gaps.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and ensures that the output is the lexicographically largest possible `b`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
