Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the minimum number of characters that need to be removed from a string to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map". The program should handle multiple test cases, each consisting of a string of lowercase Latin letters.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program iterates through each test case, reads the string, and then checks for the substrings "pie" and "map". If it finds either of these substrings, it increments the `ans` counter and skips the next two characters (since the substring is of length 3). If the substring is not found, it moves to the next character.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Skipping Characters**: The program skips the next two characters after finding "pie" or "map". This is incorrect because removing one character from the string can potentially break another "pie" or "map" substring that starts at the next position. For example, in the string "mappie", removing the first "m" would result in "appie", which still contains the substring "pie". The correct approach would be to remove only one character and then check the new substring starting from the next position.
2. **Greedy Approach**: The program uses a greedy approach by removing one occurrence of "pie" or "map" at a time and then moving forward. This approach does not guarantee the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. For example, in the string "mappie", removing the "m" from "map" would be optimal, but the program might remove the "p" from "pie" first, leading to a suboptimal solution.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. It can produce incorrect results for certain test cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
