Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each test case and counting the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the given string `s`. However, the logic for counting the minimum deletions required to make the string beautiful is flawed. The current implementation simply counts the number of times "map" or "pie" appears in the string and increments the answer by 1 for each occurrence. This approach does not guarantee that the minimum number of deletions is calculated, as it does not consider overlapping occurrences or the optimal way to remove characters to avoid future occurrences.

For example, consider the string "ppiee". The program would count "pie" once and output 1, but the optimal solution is to remove just the 'i' and 'e' to make the string "ppe", which requires only 2 deletions.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated algorithm is needed, such as dynamic programming or a greedy approach that considers the optimal deletions to avoid future occurrences of "map" or "pie".

Given the current implementation's logic, it does not correctly compute the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **False**
