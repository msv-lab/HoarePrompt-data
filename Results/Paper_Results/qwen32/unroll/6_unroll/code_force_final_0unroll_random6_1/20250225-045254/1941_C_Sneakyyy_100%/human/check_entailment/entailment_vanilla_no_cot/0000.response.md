Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of characters to remove to make the string beautiful. The main issue is that the program only checks for the substrings "map" and "pie" in non-overlapping segments of three characters. This means it might miss cases where removing a single character can prevent the formation of these substrings.

For example, consider the string "mappie". The program would only count one removal (either "map" or "pie"), but the optimal solution is to remove just one character ('p' or 'a') to make the string beautiful.

A correct approach would involve dynamic programming or a more sophisticated greedy algorithm to ensure that we are making the optimal removals.
