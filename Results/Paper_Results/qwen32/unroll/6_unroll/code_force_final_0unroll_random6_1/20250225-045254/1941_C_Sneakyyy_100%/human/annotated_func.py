#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        ans = 0
        
        i = 0
        
        while i < len(a) - 2:
            s = a[i:i + 3]
            if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
                i += 3
                ans += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: For each test case, the number of times the substring "map" or "pie" appears in the string `s` as a contiguous sequence.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a string of lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, it counts and prints the number of times the substrings "map" or "pie" appear as contiguous sequences within the string.
