### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem by determining a suitable distribution of bets such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. The approach involves using the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers to determine the bets.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the number of outcomes `n` and the list of multipliers `k` are read.

2. **LCM Calculation:**
   - The `lcm` function calculates the least common multiple of the multipliers. This is done by iteratively computing the LCM of the current LCM and the next multiplier using the formula: `lcm(a, b) = (a * b) // gcd(a, b)`.

3. **Bet Calculation:**
   - The bets are calculated by dividing the LCM by each multiplier. This ensures that the sum of the bets is less than the LCM.

4. **Sum of Bets:**
   - The sum of the calculated bets is computed. If this sum is greater than or equal to the LCM, it means no valid distribution of bets exists, and the program outputs `-1`.

5. **Output:**
   - If a valid distribution of bets exists, the program outputs the bets.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **LCM Usage:**
  - The LCM ensures that the bets are distributed in such a way that the total bet is minimized while still satisfying the condition that the total bet is less than the amount received for any winning outcome.
  
- **Bet Calculation:**
  - By dividing the LCM by each multiplier, the program ensures that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the LCM. This is because the sum of the bets is the sum of the LCM divided by each multiplier, which is less than the LCM itself.

- **Condition Check:**
  - The program correctly checks if the sum of the bets is less than the LCM. If not, it outputs `-1`, indicating no valid distribution exists.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It uses the LCM to determine the bets and checks the necessary condition to ensure the bets are valid. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
