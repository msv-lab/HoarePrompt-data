To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic and see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap
The task is to distribute the coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. Specifically, for each outcome `i`, the sum of all bets `x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n` must be strictly less than `k_i * x_i`.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.

2. **LCM Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i`. This is done by iteratively computing the LCM of the current LCM and each multiplier.
   
3. **Bet Calculation:**
   - For each outcome `i`, the program calculates the bet `x_i` as `prod // k_i`, where `prod` is the LCM of all multipliers.
   - It then sums up all the bets.
   
4. **Validation:**
   - The program checks if the total sum of the bets is strictly less than the LCM. If it is, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Correctness Analysis

The key idea behind the program is to use the LCM of the multipliers to ensure that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome.

#### Why the LCM Works:
- The LCM of the multipliers ensures that `prod // k_i` is an integer for each `i`.
- The condition `x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n < k_i * x_i` can be rewritten as `x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n < prod` when `x_i = prod // k_i` because `k_i * (prod // k_i) = prod`.

#### Validation:
- The program correctly checks if the total sum of the bets is less than the LCM. If it is, then for each `i`, `k_i * x_i` will indeed be greater than the total sum of bets, satisfying the problem's requirement.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets and checks the conditions as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
