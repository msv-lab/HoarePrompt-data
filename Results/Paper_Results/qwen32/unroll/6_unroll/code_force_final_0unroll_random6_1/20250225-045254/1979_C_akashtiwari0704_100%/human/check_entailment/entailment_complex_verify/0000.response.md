Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to distribute coins among `n` possible outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received if any one of the outcomes wins. Specifically, if `x_i` is the bet on the `i-th` outcome and `k_i` is the multiplier for that outcome, we need:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \quad \text{for all } i \]

### Code Analysis

The code calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers and then distributes the bets as follows:
1. Calculate the LCM of the multipliers.
2. For each multiplier `k_i`, set the bet `x_i` to `LCM / k_i`.
3. Sum these bets and check if the sum is less than the LCM. If it is, print the bets; otherwise, print `-1`.

### Key Points

- The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the multipliers.
- By setting `x_i = LCM / k_i`, the code ensures that `k_i * x_i = LCM` for each `i`.
- The condition `sumo < prod` (where `sumo` is the sum of the bets and `prod` is the LCM) is intended to ensure that the total sum of bets is less than `LCM`.

### Evaluation of the Code

1. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM calculation is correct. It ensures that `LCM` is divisible by each `k_i`.
2. **Bet Distribution**: The bets are set to `LCM / k_i`, which ensures that `k_i * x_i = LCM` for each `i`.
3. **Condition Check**: The condition `sumo < prod` is checked to ensure that the total sum of bets is less than `LCM`.

However, the core issue is whether `sumo < LCM` guarantees that `sumo < k_i * x_i` for all `i`. Since `k_i * x_i = LCM` for each `i`, the condition `sumo < LCM` directly implies that `sumo < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

### Counterexample in Original Assessment

The original assessment provides a counterexample:
```
1
3
2 2 2
```
- LCM of `[2, 2, 2]` is `2`.
- Bets would be `[1, 1, 1]` (since `2 // 2 = 1` for each multiplier).
- Sum of bets is `3`, which is not less than `2 * 1 = 2` for any `k_i * x_i`.

This counterexample is incorrect because the sum of bets (`3`) is indeed not less than `LCM` (`2`). The code correctly identifies this and should output `-1`.

### Conclusion

The code correctly implements the logic to determine the bets and checks the necessary condition. The original assessment incorrectly identifies a counterexample where the code should output `-1`, but the code correctly does so.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**
