The code snippet provided initializes a variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `nums`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initial values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums` with the addition of `ans` being set to 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a deque of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and `ans` is 0.**
