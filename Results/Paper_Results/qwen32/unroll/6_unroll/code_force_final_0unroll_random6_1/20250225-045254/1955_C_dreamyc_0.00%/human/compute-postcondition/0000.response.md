The given code snippet converts the list `nums` into a `deque` object. This change affects the data structure of `nums` but does not alter the values or the constraints of the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and `nums` is a deque of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
