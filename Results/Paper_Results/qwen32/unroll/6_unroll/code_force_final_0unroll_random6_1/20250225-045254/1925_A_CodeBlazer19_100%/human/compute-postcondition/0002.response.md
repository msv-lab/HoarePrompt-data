To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand what the loop does. The loop runs `t` times, and in each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input. It then prints the first `k` letters of the alphabet repeated `n` times.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is the number of iterations (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676)
- `n` and `k` are integers (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26)

In each iteration, the loop:
1. Reads new values for `n` and `k`.
2. Prints the first `k` letters of the alphabet repeated `n` times.

Since the loop runs `t` times, it will print `t` lines of output, each determined by the respective `n` and `k` values read in that iteration.

The state of `t` remains unchanged as it is only used to control the number of iterations. The variables `n` and `k` are reassigned in each iteration and do not retain their values between iterations.

Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` remains the same, and `n` and `k` will hold the values from the last iteration. However, the primary output is `t` lines of text, each being the first `k` letters of the alphabet repeated `n` times as specified by the input for each iteration.**
