The code snippet converts each string in the set `nums` to an integer, sorts the resulting integers, and then reassigns the sorted list back to `nums`. The variable `N` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`N` is assigned the value of the first integer input; `nums` is a sorted list of integers derived from the split first line input.**
