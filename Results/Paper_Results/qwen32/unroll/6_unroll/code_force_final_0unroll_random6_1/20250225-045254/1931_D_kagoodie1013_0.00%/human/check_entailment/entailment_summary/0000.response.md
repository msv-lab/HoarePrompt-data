Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to count the number of beautiful pairs in the array `a` for each test case. However, there is a mistake in the way it counts the pairs. Specifically, the program checks for `-num % x` instead of `num % x` for the first condition, which is incorrect. The condition for a pair `(i, j)` to be beautiful is that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`. This translates to the following conditions in terms of modulo operations:
1. `(a_i % x + a_j % x) % x == 0` which simplifies to `a_i % x == -a_j % x` or `a_i % x == (x - a_j % x) % x`.
2. `(a_i % y - a_j % y) % y == 0` which simplifies to `a_i % y == a_j % y`.

The current implementation incorrectly uses `-num % x` for the first condition and does not correctly account for the fact that `a_i % x == -a_j % x` is equivalent to `a_i % x == (x - a_j % x) % x`.

To fix the program, we need to change the calculation of `mod_x` to use `(x - num % x) % x` instead of `-num % x`.

However, based on the provided execution summary and the given test cases, the program seems to be counting pairs using a different logic that does not match the problem description accurately. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
