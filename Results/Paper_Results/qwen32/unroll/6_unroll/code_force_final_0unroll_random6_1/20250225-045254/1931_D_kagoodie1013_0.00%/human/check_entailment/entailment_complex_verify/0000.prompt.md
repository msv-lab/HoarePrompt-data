You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Polycarp considers a pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) (1 \(\le\) i < j \(\le\) n) beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The program is supposed to count all such beautiful pairs in the array \(a\).

### Analysis of the Program:
The provided program uses a strategy based on modular arithmetic to count the beautiful pairs efficiently.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:
1. For each test case, it initializes two dictionaries: `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`.
2. It iterates through each number in the array:
   - It calculates `mod_x` as \(-num \% x\) and `mod_y` as `num \% y`.
   - It increments the count by the number of elements seen so far that have the same `mod_x` and `mod_y`.
   - It updates the counts in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for the current number's `mod_x` and `mod_y`.

### Key Points to Verify:
- The program should correctly count pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) such that \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).
- The use of \(-num \% x\) for `mod_x` seems unusual and might need verification.

### Verification:
Let's consider the conditions for a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\):
- \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) implies \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\).
- \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\) implies \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\).

The program's logic:
- Uses `mod_x = -num % x` to check for \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\).
- Uses `mod_y = num % y` to check for \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\).

However, the program's approach of using `mod_x = -num % x` might not be correct. The correct approach should be to use `mod_x = a_i % x` and `mod_y = a_i % y` and then check for the corresponding conditions in the maps.

### Example Case to Test:
Let's consider a simple case:
- \(n = 4\), \(x = 3\), \(y = 2\)
- \(a = [1, 2, 4, 5]\)

Beautiful pairs:
- \(\langle 1, 3 \rangle\): \(1 + 4 = 5\) (not divisible by 3), \(1 - 4 = -3\) (divisible by 2)
- \(\langle 1, 4 \rangle\): \(1 + 5 = 6\) (divisible by 3), \(1 - 5 = -4\) (not divisible by 2)
- \(\langle 2, 3 \rangle\): \(2 + 4 = 6\) (divisible by 3), \(2 - 4 = -2\) (divisible by 2)
- \(\langle 2, 4 \rangle\): \(2 + 5 = 7\) (not divisible by 3), \(2 - 5 = -3\) (divisible by 2)
- \(\langle 3, 4 \rangle\): \(4 + 5 = 9\) (divisible by 3), \(4 - 5 = -1\) (not divisible by 2)

Only \(\langle 2, 3 \rangle\) is a beautiful pair.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with the above example:
- Input: `1 4 3 2 1 2 4 5`
- Expected Output: `1`

Running the program with this input:
- The program incorrectly counts pairs based on the flawed logic of `mod_x = -num % x`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in calculating `mod_x`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program incorrectly calculates `mod_x` as \(-num \% x\) instead of `num \% x` for checking the condition \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\). This leads to incorrect counting of beautiful pairs.
