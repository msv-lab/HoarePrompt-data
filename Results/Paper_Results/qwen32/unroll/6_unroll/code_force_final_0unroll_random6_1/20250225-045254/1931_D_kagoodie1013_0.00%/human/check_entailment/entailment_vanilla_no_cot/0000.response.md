Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the way it calculates the number of beautiful pairs. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the modular values and does not correctly account for the conditions required for a pair to be considered beautiful.

Here are the issues:

1. **Modular Calculation**: The program calculates `mod_x` as `-num % x`, which is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `num % x` for both conditions.
   
2. **Counting Logic**: The program attempts to count beautiful pairs by incrementing the count based on the values in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`. However, the logic for counting pairs is flawed. The program should be checking for pairs `(i, j)` where `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`. This means it should be checking for specific combinations of remainders, not just the individual counts of remainders.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, x, y) = map(int, data[index:index + 3])
    index += 3
    arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))

def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        mod_map = {}
        for num in arr:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            key = (mod_x, mod_y)
            count += mod_map.get(key, 0)
            mod_map[key] = mod_map.get(key, 0) + 1
        results.append(count)
    return results

results = func_1(test_cases)
print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))
```

In this corrected version, the program uses a single dictionary `mod_map` to store pairs of remainders `(mod_x, mod_y)` and counts the number of times each pair appears. This allows it to correctly count the number of beautiful pairs.
