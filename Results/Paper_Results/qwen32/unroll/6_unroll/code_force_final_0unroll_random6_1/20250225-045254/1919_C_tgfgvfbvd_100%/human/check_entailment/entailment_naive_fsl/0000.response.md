Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze why:

The logic in the program attempts to keep track of two thresholds `a` and `b` to determine the penalty, but it does not correctly split the array into two subsequences `s` and `t` and calculate the penalty for each subsequence independently.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Initialization of `a` and `b`**: The variables `a` and `b` are initialized to `float('inf')`, which is appropriate for finding the minimum values.
2. **Logic for updating `a` and `b`**: The logic for updating `a` and `b` is flawed. The code does not correctly handle the case where an element should go into a different subsequence to minimize the penalty. Instead, it just tries to maintain two thresholds `a` and `b` and increments the penalty counter `c` whenever it encounters an element that is greater than both `a` and `b`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to split the array into two subsequences such that the penalty for each subsequence is minimized. One way to achieve this is to use a greedy approach where we try to maintain two increasing subsequences.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = []
        t = []
        for x in l:
            if not s or x >= s[-1]:
                s.append(x)
            elif not t or x >= t[-1]:
                t.append(x)
            else:
                if s[-1] < t[-1]:
                    s.append(x)
                else:
                    t.append(x)
        # Calculate penalties
        penalty_s = sum(1 for i in range(1, len(s)) if s[i] > s[i-1])
        penalty_t = sum(1 for i in range(1, len(t)) if t[i] > t[i-1])
        print(penalty_s + penalty_t)

```

This corrected version maintains two subsequences `s` and `t` and ensures that each element is added to the subsequence that will minimize the penalty. It then calculates the penalties for both subsequences and sums them up.

Since the original program does not correctly implement the logic to split the array and calculate the penalties, it is incorrect. Thus, the answer is **False**.
