Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty. The logic used in the program does not accurately split the array into two subsequences in a way that minimizes the total penalty. The program seems to be attempting to track two values (`a` and `b`) and increment a counter (`c`) based on certain conditions, but this approach does not guarantee an optimal split.

To correctly solve the problem, one could consider a different strategy, such as sorting the array and then determining the best way to split it to minimize the penalties, or using dynamic programming to explore different splits. However, the current implementation does not achieve this.

Here is a brief outline of a correct approach:

1. Sort the array.
2. Consider different points to split the sorted array into two subsequences.
3. Calculate the penalty for each possible split.
4. Choose the split with the minimum total penalty.

The provided program does not follow such a strategy, so it is incorrect.
