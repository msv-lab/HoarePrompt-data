In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`, which is the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that the input to `int(input())` is a positive integer. Since the problem states that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5`, we know that the input will be at least 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute at least once.

However, to strictly adhere to the format and ensure clarity, we will state that the input to `int(input())` must be at least 1, which guarantees that the loop will execute.

State: **The input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer (at least 1)**
