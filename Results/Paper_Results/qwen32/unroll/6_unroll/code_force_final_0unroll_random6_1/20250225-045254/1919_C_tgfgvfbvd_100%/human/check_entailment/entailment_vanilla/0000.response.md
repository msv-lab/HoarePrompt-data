Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to split the array `a` into two subsequences `s` and `t` such that the sum of penalties `p(s) + p(t)` is minimized. The penalty `p(b)` for a sequence `b` is defined as the number of indices `i` where `b[i] < b[i + 1]`.

### Key Observations:
1. **Splitting Strategy**: To minimize the penalty, we should aim to create subsequences `s` and `t` such that the number of increasing pairs within each subsequence is minimized.
2. **Greedy Approach**: The provided program seems to follow a greedy approach where it tries to maintain two "potential" subsequences by keeping track of the smallest elements seen so far (`a` and `b`).

### Program Analysis:
The program iterates through the list `l` and tries to assign each element to one of the two subsequences (`a` and `b`). It increments the penalty count `c` whenever an element cannot be placed in either of the two subsequences without violating the increasing order.

#### Detailed Steps:
1. Initialize `a` and `b` to infinity, which will hold the last elements of the two subsequences.
2. Iterate through each element `x` in the list `l`:
   - If `a > b`, swap `a` and `b` to ensure `a` is always the smaller of the two.
   - If the current element `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, update `a` to `l[x]`.
   - Else if `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, update `b` to `l[x]`.
   - Else, increment the penalty count `c` and update `a` to `l[x]`.

### Issues in the Program:
The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal splitting strategy. The logic for maintaining the two subsequences is flawed, and it does not guarantee the minimum possible penalty.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the input `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`:
- The program might assign `3` to `a`, `1` to `b`, `4` to `a`, `1` to `b`, and `5` to `a`.
- This results in `c = 2` (penalty count), but the optimal split could be `s = [2, 4, 5]` and `t = [1, 3]` with a penalty of `3`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not guarantee the minimum possible penalty. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
