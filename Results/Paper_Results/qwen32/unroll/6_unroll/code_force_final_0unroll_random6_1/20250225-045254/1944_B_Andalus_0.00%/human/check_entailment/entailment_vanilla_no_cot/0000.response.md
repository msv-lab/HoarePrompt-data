Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling Single Elements (`sng`)**: The program attempts to use single elements from the left part (`lft`) to balance the XOR of the subsets `l` and `r`. However, it does not ensure that these single elements are present in the right part (`rgt`), which might lead to an invalid solution.

2. **Incomplete XOR Matching**: The program does not ensure that the XOR of the selected elements in `l` matches the XOR of the selected elements in `r`. It simply prints pairs of duplicate elements and then single elements without ensuring the XOR condition.

3. **Output Format**: The program does not handle the output format correctly. It prints the elements of `l` and `r` in the same line without a newline in between, which is not compliant with the problem's output requirements.

4. **Logic for Subset Selection**: The program does not have a robust logic to select elements from `lft` and `rgt` to ensure that the XOR of `l` equals the XOR of `r`. It only considers duplicate elements and single elements without a proper strategy to balance the XOR.

To fix these issues, the program needs to implement a strategy to ensure that the XOR of the selected subsets `l` and `r` are equal, and it must handle the output format correctly. One possible approach is to use a greedy strategy or a backtracking approach to find valid subsets `l` and `r` that satisfy the XOR condition.
