To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the code within the loop for each test case. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - For each test case, the values of `n` and `k` are read.
   - A list `lst` of `2n` integers is read, where each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice.

2. **List Splitting and Sorting:**
   - The list `lst` is split into two halves: `lft` and `rgt`, each of length `n`.
   - Both `lft` and `rgt` are sorted.

3. **Identifying Duplicates and Singletons:**
   - `ldb` (left duplicates) collects elements that appear twice in `lft`.
   - `rdb` (right duplicates) collects elements that appear twice in `rgt`.
   - `sng` (singletons) collects elements that appear exactly once in `lft`.

4. **Output Generation:**
   - For both `lft` and `rgt`:
     - Print pairs of duplicate elements from `ldb` until `k` elements are printed.
     - If there are still less than `k` elements printed, print elements from `sng` until `k` elements are printed.
     - After printing, a newline is printed.

5. **State After Loop Execution:**
   - The loop processes each test case independently.
   - The output state is determined by the printed elements for each test case.
   - The variables `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, `sng`, and `sz` are reset and re-initialized for each test case.
   - The initial state variables `t` and `T` remain unchanged.

Given that the output state is defined by the printed elements for each test case and not by the final values of the variables, the output state can be described as the series of printed elements for all test cases.

Output State: **The output state is a series of printed elements for each test case, where for each test case, up to `k` elements are printed from the duplicates in `lft` and `rgt`, and if necessary, from the singletons in `lft`. Each test case's output is followed by a newline.**
