### Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing two arrays `l` and `r` each of length `2k` such that:
- `l` is a subset of the first `n` elements of `a`.
- `r` is a subset of the last `n` elements of `a`.
- The bitwise XOR of elements in `l` equals the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`.

The provided program attempts to construct such arrays by considering the following:
1. **Duplicates in the First Half (`lft`)**: It identifies pairs of identical elements in the first half of the array and adds them to `ldb` (duplicates in the left half).
2. **Duplicates in the Second Half (`rgt`)**: It identifies pairs of identical elements in the second half of the array and adds them to `rdb` (duplicates in the right half).
3. **Singletons in the First Half**: It identifies elements that appear only once in the first half of the array and adds them to `sng`.

The program then constructs the arrays `l` and `r` by:
1. Adding pairs of duplicates from `ldb` and `rdb` until the required length `2k` is reached.
2. Adding singletons from `sng` if needed to reach the required length `2k`.

However, there are several issues with the logic:
- The program does not consider that the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` must be equal. Simply adding elements from `ldb` and `sng` does not guarantee that the XOR values will be equal.
- The program does not handle the scenario where there are not enough elements in `ldb` and `sng` to construct arrays of length `2k`.
- The program does not ensure that the elements of `l` are a subset of `lft` and the elements of `r` are a subset of `rgt` in the correct order.

### Example Analysis:

Consider the test case:
```
6 2
5 1 3 3 5 1 2 6 4 6 4 2
```
The program might output:
```
5 1 3 3
6 4 2 4
```
However, the XOR of `5 1 3 3` is `5 ^ 1 ^ 3 ^ 3 = 5 ^ 1`, and the XOR of `6 4 2 4` is `6 ^ 4 ^ 2 ^ 4 = 6 ^ 2`, which are not equal.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly ensure that the bitwise XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` are equal. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
