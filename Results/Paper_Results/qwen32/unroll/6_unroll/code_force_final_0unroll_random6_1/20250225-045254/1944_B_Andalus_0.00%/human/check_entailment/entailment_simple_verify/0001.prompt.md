You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find two arrays `l` and `r` of length `2k` each, with the following properties:
1. `l` is a subset of the first `n` elements of the array `a`.
2. `r` is a subset of the last `n` elements of the array `a`.
3. The bitwise XOR of the elements of `l` must be equal to the bitwise XOR of the elements of `r`.

### Program Analysis
The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases `T`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.
3. It reads the array `a` and splits it into two halves `lft` and `rgt`.
4. It then identifies the elements that appear twice in `lft` (stored in `ldb`) and the elements that appear only once in `lft` (stored in `sng`).
5. It does the same for `rgt` and stores the elements that appear twice in `rgt` in `rdb`.
6. It then constructs the arrays `l` and `r` by:
   - Adding pairs of elements from `ldb` to `l` and `r` until `k` elements are added.
   - Adding elements from `sng` to `l` and `r` until `k` elements are added.
7. Finally, it prints the arrays `l` and `r`.

### Correctness Check
Now let's verify if the program correctly solves the problem:

1. **Subset Condition**: The program ensures that `l` is a subset of the first `n` elements and `r` is a subset of the last `n` elements by using the `lft` and `rgt` arrays respectively.
2. **XOR Condition**: The program attempts to ensure that the XOR of `l` and `r` are equal by:
   - Adding pairs of identical elements (which have a XOR of 0) to both `l` and `r`.
   - Adding the same unique elements to both `l` and `r`.

However, there is a critical issue in the program:
- The program does not guarantee that the final XOR of `l` and `r` will be equal. The program only adds pairs of identical elements and unique elements to both `l` and `r` but does not handle the case where the remaining elements in `sng` do not perfectly balance the XOR values.

### Counterexample
Consider the following input:
```
1
4 2
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
```
The program will produce:
```
1 2 1 2
1 2 1 2
```
This is correct because both `l` and `r` have the same elements and their XOR is the same.

However, consider another input:
```
1
4 2
1 2 3 4 4 3 2 1
```
The program might produce:
```
4 4 1 2
4 4 1 2
```
This is incorrect because while the program adds pairs of identical elements, it does not ensure that the XOR of the remaining elements from `sng` will balance out correctly.

### Conclusion
The program does not guarantee that the XOR of `l` and `r` will always be equal for all possible inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
