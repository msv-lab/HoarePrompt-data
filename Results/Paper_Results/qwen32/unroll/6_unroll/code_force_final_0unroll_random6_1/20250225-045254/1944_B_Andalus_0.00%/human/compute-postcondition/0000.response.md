The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `T`. This integer represents the number of test cases, `t`, provided in the initial state. The values of `n`, `k`, and the array `a` are not affected by this code snippet.

Given the initial state and the code, the output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is the input integer value representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= floor(n/2), and `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.**
