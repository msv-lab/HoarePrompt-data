Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic for determining the final score of the game based on the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. Specifically, the code does not account for the alternating turns of Alice and Bob and their respective strategies to maximize or minimize the MEX of the final array `c`.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:
1. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**: The code simply counts the frequency of each number in the array and finds the smallest number that appears less than twice. This does not consider the strategic moves of Alice and Bob. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it. The code does not simulate the game turns or account for the optimal choices each player would make.
  
2. **Incorrect Handling of Frequencies**: The code counts the frequency of each number and then looks for the smallest number that appears less than twice to determine the MEX. This is not the correct way to determine the final MEX after optimal play by both players.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The code does not handle cases where all numbers appear an even number of times, or where the array contains only one unique number, or other edge cases that might require more complex strategic decisions.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:
- **Input**: 
  ```
  1
  3
  0 1 2
  ```
- **Expected Output**: `3` (since Alice can choose 0, Bob chooses 1, Alice chooses 2, resulting in `c = [0, 1, 2]` with MEX = 3)
- **Actual Output**: `3` (the code happens to give the correct output for this specific case, but this is not guaranteed for all cases)

However, consider another case:
- **Input**: 
  ```
  1
  4
  0 0 1 1
  ```
- **Expected Output**: `2` (as per the problem statement example)
- **Actual Output**: `2` (the code gives the correct output, but again, this is not guaranteed for all cases)

The code does not account for the strategic moves required to achieve the optimal MEX. Therefore, it is incorrect in a general sense.

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to simulate the game turns and use a strategy to maximize or minimize the MEX based on the players' moves. This would involve more complex logic than simply counting frequencies.
