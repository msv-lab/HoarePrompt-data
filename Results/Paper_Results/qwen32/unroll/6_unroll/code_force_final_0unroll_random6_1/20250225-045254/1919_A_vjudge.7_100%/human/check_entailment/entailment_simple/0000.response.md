### Reasoning:

The problem revolves around determining the winner of a game based on the number of coins each player has in their wallets. The key observation here is that the game can be analyzed based on the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of coins in both wallets.

Here's the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Game Dynamics**: 
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets or not.
   - After choosing, they must remove a coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., when both wallets are empty) loses.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will make moves that maximize their chances of winning.
   - The critical point is the parity of the total number of coins (a + b).

3. **Winning Strategy**:
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is **even**, Bob wins.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is **odd**, Alice wins.
   
   The rationale behind this is:
   - If the total number of coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves. For example, if Alice swaps, Bob swaps; if Alice doesn't swap, Bob doesn't swap. This ensures that Bob will always be the one to make the last move, leaving Alice with no valid move.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice can force Bob into a losing position. She can start by making a move that leaves an even number of coins for Bob, and then mirror his moves thereafter.

4. **Implementation**:
   - The code correctly checks the parity of the sum (a + b) using the bitwise AND operation (`a + b & 1`).
   - If the result is 0, it means the sum is even, and Bob wins.
   - If the result is 1, it means the sum is odd, and Alice wins.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. If the sum is even, Bob wins; if the sum is odd, Alice wins.
Correctness: **True**
