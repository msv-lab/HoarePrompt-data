The function `func_1` takes a list `row` of non-negative integers and an integer `d` such that 1 <= d <= len(row) - 2. It modifies the elements of `row` starting from index `d` by adding the smallest values from a heap plus the current values of the elements in `row` plus 1, and returns the last element of the updated `row` list.
