### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the function summaries provided.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Objective:** Build `k` bridges on consecutive rows of an `n x m` grid (river) such that each bridge spans from the first column to the last column with supports at most `d` distance apart.
- **Cost Calculation:** The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a[i, j] + 1`.
- **Constraints:** 
  - First and last columns have depth `0`.
  - Supports must be installed in the first and last columns.
  - Distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
- **Output:** Minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` bridges.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Purpose:** Calculate the minimum cost to build a single bridge on a given row.
   - **Mechanism:** 
     - Initializes the first `d` elements of the row with values `a[i, j] + 1`.
     - Uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost up to the current column.
     - Ensures that supports are placed such that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports does not exceed `d`.
   - **Function Summary:** The function calculates the minimum cost for a single row considering the `d` distance constraint.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - **Purpose:** Read input, calculate costs for each row using `func_1`, and determine the minimum total cost of selecting `k` consecutive rows' costs.
   - **Mechanism:**
     - Reads the number of test cases, dimensions of the grid, number of bridges, and maximum distance between supports.
     - Calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
     - Sums the costs for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
     - Outputs the minimum total cost.
   - **Function Summary:** The function reads a grid configuration and determines the minimum total cost of selecting `k` consecutive rows' costs using the costs calculated by `func_1`.

#### Potential Issues:

- **Consecutive Rows Constraint:** The primary concern is whether the problem requires that supports in consecutive rows must also be within `d` distance apart. The problem description specifies the `d` distance constraint within a single row but does not explicitly mention a similar constraint between consecutive rows.
- **Edge Cases:** The program handles basic edge cases such as `k = 1` and `k = n` correctly. However, it does not explicitly address the scenario where `k > 1` and supports in consecutive rows need to be within `d` distance apart.

#### Additional Considerations:

- **Clarification Needed:** The problem description does not explicitly mention a constraint on supports between consecutive rows. If this is indeed a requirement, the program is incorrect. However, based on the provided examples and the problem description, the program appears to work correctly under the assumption that the `d` constraint is only within a single row.

### Conclusion:

Given that the problem description does not explicitly mention a constraint on supports between consecutive rows, we can assume that the program is correct. The provided examples and the function summaries align with the expected behavior of the program.

**Final Evaluation:**

Final: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows by first computing the cost for each row individually and then finding the minimum sum of costs for `k` consecutive rows. The program handles the constraints provided in the problem description, and there are no obvious edge cases that it fails to address. Based on the problem description and the provided examples, the program appears to work correctly.
