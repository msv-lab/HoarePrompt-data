To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):`. This means that the loop will execute if the expression `len(costs) - (k - 1)` is greater than 0, indicating that there are enough elements in the `costs` list to satisfy the loop's range.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **`costs` List**: The length of the `costs` list is crucial. The loop will execute if `len(costs) - (k - 1) > 0`, which simplifies to `len(costs) > k - 1`. Therefore, `costs` must have at least `k` elements.
2. **`k` Integer**: The value of `k` determines the minimum number of elements `costs` must have for the loop to execute. If `k` is greater than the length of `costs`, the loop will not execute.
3. **`i` Integer**: The variable `i` is the loop counter and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts. It will be initialized to 0 by the `range` function.

Given the above points, we need to ensure that `costs` has at least `k` elements. The values of `n`, `m`, `d`, and the contents of `rows` and `total_costs` are not directly relevant to the execution of the loop, so we do not need to adjust them.

### Final State

State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `d` is the fourth input integer, `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row of `n` space-separated integers read from the input, `costs` is a list of values returned by `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows` and must have at least `k` elements, `total_costs` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
