Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Analysis:

**Problem Description Recap:**
- **Objective:** Build `k` bridges on consecutive rows of an `n x m` grid (river) such that each bridge spans from the first column to the last column with supports at most `d` distance apart.
- **Cost Calculation:** The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a[i, j] + 1`.
- **Constraints:** 
  - First and last columns have depth `0`.
  - Supports must be installed in the first and last columns.
  - Distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
- **Output:** Minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` bridges.

**Program Analysis:**

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the minimum cost to build a single bridge on a given row.
   - It initializes the first `d` elements of the row with values `a[i, j] + 1` and uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost up to the current column.
   - The function ensures that the supports are placed such that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports does not exceed `d`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the input, which includes the number of test cases, dimensions of the grid, number of bridges, and maximum distance between supports.
   - It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and returns the minimum total cost.

### Potential Issues:

- **Consecutive Rows Constraint:** The program correctly calculates the cost for each row individually and then sums the costs for `k` consecutive rows. However, it does not explicitly check if the supports in consecutive rows are placed in a manner that respects the `d` distance constraint between rows. This could be a potential issue if the problem requires that supports in consecutive rows are also within `d` distance apart.
- **Edge Cases:** The program handles the edge case where `k = 1` correctly by simply finding the minimum cost for a single row. It also handles the case where `k > 1` by summing the costs of `k` consecutive rows. However, it does not explicitly handle the case where `k = n`, which means building bridges on all rows.

### Conclusion:

The provided program seems to correctly calculate the minimum cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows based on the given problem description. However, there is a potential issue with the assumption that supports in consecutive rows do not need to respect the `d` distance constraint between rows. If this is indeed a requirement, the program is incorrect. Otherwise, based on the provided examples and the problem description, the program appears to work correctly.

Since the problem description does not explicitly mention the constraint on supports between consecutive rows, we will assume that the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**

### Explanation:
The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows by first computing the cost for each row individually and then finding the minimum sum of costs for `k` consecutive rows. The program handles the constraints provided in the problem description, and there are no obvious edge cases that it fails to address.
