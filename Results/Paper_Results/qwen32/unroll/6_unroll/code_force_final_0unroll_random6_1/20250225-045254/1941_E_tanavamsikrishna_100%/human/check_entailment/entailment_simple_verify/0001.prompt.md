You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is
that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his
friend solve this problem.

The river is a grid of n rows and m columns. The intersection of the i -th row
and the j -th column contains the number a_{i,j} — the depth in the
corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the
river banks, so the depth for them is 0 .

The river may look like this.

Rudolf can choose the row (i,1), (i,2), \ldots, (i,m) and build a bridge over
it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost
of installing a support in the cell (i,j) is a_{i,j}+1 . Supports must be
installed so that the following conditions are met:

  1. A support must be installed in cell (i,1) ; 
  2. A support must be installed in cell (i,m) ; 
  3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d . The distance between supports (i, j_1) and (i, j_2) is |j_1 - j_2| - 1 . 

Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k
bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i (1 \le i
\le n - k + 1 ) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i, i + 1,
\ldots, i + k - 1 . Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing
supports.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , m , k , and d (1
\le k \le n \le 100 , 3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le d \le m ) — the number
of rows and columns of the field, the number of bridges, and the maximum
distance between supports.

Then follow n lines, i -th line contains m positive integers a_{i, j} (0 \le
a_{i, j} \le 10^6 , a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 ) — the depths of the river cells.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot m for all sets of input data does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum total cost of
supports installation.

Note

In the first test case, it is most profitable to build a bridge on the second
row.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/6b5282a065196a0a0ca650a68a351af816de8549.png)
It is not a top view, but side view: gray cells — bridge itself, white cells
are empty, black cells — supports, blue cells — water, brown cells — river
bottom.

In the second test case, it is most profitable to build bridges on the second
and third rows. The supports will be placed in cells (2, 3) , (3, 2) , and on
the river banks.

In the third test case the supports can be placed along the river banks.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Objective**: Minimize the total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive bridges over a river grid.
2. **Constraints**:
    - The river grid has `n` rows and `m` columns.
    - Each bridge spans one row and must have supports at `(i,1)` and `(i,m)`.
    - The distance between any two adjacent supports in a row must be no more than `d`.
    - The cost of installing a support at `(i,j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.
3. **Approach**:
    - For each row, calculate the minimum cost to place supports such that the constraints are met.
    - Sum the costs for `k` consecutive rows and find the minimum total cost.

### Program Analysis

1. **Function `func_1(row, d)`**:
    - This function calculates the minimum cost to place supports in a single row.
    - It initializes the first `d` elements of the row with specific values.
    - It uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost of placing supports within the last `d+1` positions.
    - It iterates through the row, updating the cost of placing a support at each position based on the minimum cost from the heap.
    - It returns the cost of placing supports in the last position of the row.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
    - It reads the number of test cases.
    - For each test case, it reads the parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
    - It reads the river grid.
    - It calculates the minimum cost for placing supports in each row using `func_1`.
    - It calculates the total cost for each set of `k` consecutive rows.
    - It prints the minimum total cost among all sets of `k` consecutive rows.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Function `func_1(row, d)`**:
    - The logic for initializing the first `d` elements and using a min-heap to track the minimum cost within the last `d+1` positions seems correct.
    - However, the line `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2): pass` seems unnecessary and might lead to incorrect behavior. It pops elements from the heap without using them if they are out of the range, but it doesn't re-push them, which could lead to incorrect heap state.
    - It correctly updates the cost of placing a support at each position based on the minimum cost from the heap.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
    - It correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
    - It calculates the minimum cost for placing supports in each row using `func_1`.
    - It correctly calculates the total cost for each set of `k` consecutive rows.
    - It prints the minimum total cost among all sets of `k` consecutive rows.

### Conclusion

The program has a potential issue in `func_1` due to the unnecessary `while` loop that pops elements from the heap without using them, which could lead to incorrect heap state and, consequently, incorrect results.

**Correctness: **False**
