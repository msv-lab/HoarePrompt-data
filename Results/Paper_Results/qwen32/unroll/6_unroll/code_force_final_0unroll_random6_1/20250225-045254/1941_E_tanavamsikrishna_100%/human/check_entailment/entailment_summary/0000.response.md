### Reasoning:

The problem requires building bridges over a river represented as a grid, where each cell has a certain depth. The bridges must be built on consecutive rows, and the cost of building a bridge on a row is determined by installing supports in certain cells according to specific rules.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: To calculate the cost of building a bridge on a single row.
- **Logic**:
  - The function initializes the first `d` elements of the row.
  - It uses a min-heap to keep track of the smallest costs encountered so far.
  - For each cell from index `d` to the end of the row, it finds the smallest cost within the last `d+1` cells, adds 1, and updates the current cell's cost.
  - The final cost of the row is the value in the last cell after all updates.

#### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: To find the minimum total cost of building `k` consecutive bridges.
- **Logic**:
  - Reads the dimensions of the grid (`n`, `m`), the number of bridges (`k`), and the maximum distance between supports (`d`).
  - Reads the grid itself.
  - Uses `func_1` to calculate the cost for each row.
  - Computes the total cost for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
  - Outputs the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

### Verification:
- **Correctness of `func_1`**:
  - The function correctly initializes the first `d` elements and uses a min-heap to ensure that the smallest costs are considered for each subsequent cell.
  - The logic for updating each cell with the smallest cost plus 1 is consistent with the problem's requirements.
  - The final cost returned is the cost of building a bridge on the given row, considering the constraints.

- **Correctness of `func_2`**:
  - The function reads the input correctly and calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
  - It then considers all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows and calculates the total cost for each set.
  - Finally, it outputs the minimum total cost among all sets of `k` consecutive rows, which is the desired result.

### Conclusion:
Both functions together correctly solve the problem as described. The logic and implementation of `func_1` and `func_2` align with the problem constraints and requirements.

**Correctness: True**
