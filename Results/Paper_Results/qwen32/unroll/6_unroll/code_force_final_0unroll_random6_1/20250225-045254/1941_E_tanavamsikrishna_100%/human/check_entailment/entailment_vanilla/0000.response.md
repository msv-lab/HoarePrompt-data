Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Objective**: Minimize the total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive bridges over a river grid.
2. **Constraints**:
    - The river grid has `n` rows and `m` columns.
    - Each bridge spans one row and must have supports at `(i,1)` and `(i,m)`.
    - The distance between any two adjacent supports in a row must be no more than `d`.
    - The cost of installing a support at `(i,j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.
3. **Approach**:
    - For each row, calculate the minimum cost to place supports such that the constraints are met.
    - Sum the costs for `k` consecutive rows and find the minimum total cost.

### Program Analysis

1. **Function `func_1(row, d)`**:
    - This function calculates the minimum cost to place supports in a single row.
    - It initializes the first `d` elements of the row with specific values.
    - It uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost of placing supports within the last `d+1` positions.
    - It iterates through the row, updating the cost of placing a support at each position based on the minimum cost from the heap.
    - It returns the cost of placing supports in the last position of the row.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
    - It reads the number of test cases.
    - For each test case, it reads the parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
    - It reads the river grid.
    - It calculates the minimum cost for placing supports in each row using `func_1`.
    - It calculates the total cost for each set of `k` consecutive rows.
    - It prints the minimum total cost among all sets of `k` consecutive rows.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Function `func_1(row, d)`**:
    - The logic for initializing the first `d` elements and using a min-heap to track the minimum cost within the last `d+1` positions seems correct.
    - However, the line `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2): pass` seems unnecessary and might lead to incorrect behavior. It pops elements from the heap without using them if they are out of the range, but it doesn't re-push them, which could lead to incorrect heap state.
    - It correctly updates the cost of placing a support at each position based on the minimum cost from the heap.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
    - It correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
    - It calculates the minimum cost for placing supports in each row using `func_1`.
    - It correctly calculates the total cost for each set of `k` consecutive rows.
    - It prints the minimum total cost among all sets of `k` consecutive rows.

### Conclusion

The program has a potential issue in `func_1` due to the unnecessary `while` loop that pops elements from the heap without using them, which could lead to incorrect heap state and, consequently, incorrect results.

**Correctness: **False**
