### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to verify that the program satisfies the problem description and correctly computes the minimum total cost of installing supports for the bridges.

Let's break down the program into its components and analyze each part:

1. **Function `func_1(row, d)`**:
   - **Purpose**: To calculate the cost of building a bridge on a single row, considering the constraints on the distance between supports.
   - **Process**:
     - The first element of `row` (which corresponds to the first column, a river bank) is set to 1.
     - Elements from index 1 to `d-1` are incremented by 2, reflecting the cost of placing supports at these positions.
     - A min-heap is used to keep track of the smallest values encountered so far within the window of `d` cells.
     - For each element from index `d` to the end of the row, the cost is updated by adding the smallest value from the heap (plus the current value of the cell and 1).
     - The function returns the last element of the updated row, which represents the total cost of building the bridge on that row under the given constraints.
   - **Correctness**: The function correctly implements the logic to calculate the cost of building a bridge on a single row, considering the constraints on the distance between supports. It uses a min-heap efficiently to keep track of the smallest values within the sliding window of `d` cells.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - **Purpose**: To calculate the minimum total cost of building `k` consecutive bridges across the grid.
   - **Process**:
     - Reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
     - Reads the grid of depths (`rows`).
     - Computes the cost for each row using `func_1(row, d)`, resulting in the list `costs`.
     - Computes the sum of costs for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows, storing these sums in `total_costs`.
     - Outputs the minimum value from `total_costs`, which is the minimum total cost of building `k` consecutive bridges.
   - **Correctness**: The function correctly reads the input, computes the cost for each row, and then finds the minimum total cost of selecting `k` consecutive rows. It ensures that all constraints are considered and the correct result is output.

### Conclusion:
Given the detailed analysis, both `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented correctly to solve the problem as described. The program reads the input correctly, calculates the costs using a min-heap for efficient computation, and finds the minimum total cost of building `k` consecutive bridges.

Correctness: **True**
