The provided code snippet is just a comment block and does not contain any executable Python code. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` retain their initial values and conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
