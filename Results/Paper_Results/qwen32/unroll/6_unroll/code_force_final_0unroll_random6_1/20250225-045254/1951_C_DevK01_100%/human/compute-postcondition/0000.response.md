The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer `t` typically represents the number of test cases in a problem where multiple test cases are to be processed. The initial state mentions variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list `a` which are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the value of `t` is the only change.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer; `n` is either 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `m` is either 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, `k` is either 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9); `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**
