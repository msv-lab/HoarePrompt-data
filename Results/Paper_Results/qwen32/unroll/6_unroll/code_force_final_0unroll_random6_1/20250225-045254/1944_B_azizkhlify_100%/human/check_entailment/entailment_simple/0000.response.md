### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided Python program and see if it correctly solves the problem statement.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then the array `a` of size `2n`.

2. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - It initializes two arrays `l` and `r` of size `n` to count the occurrences of each number in the first half and the second half of `a`, respectively.
   - It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a` and counts the occurrences in `l`.
   - It iterates through the next `n` elements of `a` and counts the occurrences in `r`.

3. **Building `l`**:
   - It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a` and checks if any number appears exactly twice in the first half. If so, it adds this number twice to the output list for `l` and sets the count to 0. This process continues until `l` contains `2k` elements or all such pairs are exhausted.
   - If `l` does not yet contain `2k` elements, it then adds individual numbers that appear once in the first half until `l` contains `2k` elements.

4. **Building `r`**:
   - It prints the elements of `l` first.
   - It then prints the elements of `r` by adding pairs of numbers that appear exactly twice in the second half, until the number of pairs in `r` matches the number of pairs in `l`.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness**:
  - The program ensures that `l` and `r` each contain `2k` elements.
  - The program correctly identifies pairs of numbers that appear twice in the first and second halves of `a` and uses them to construct `l` and `r`.
  - The XOR condition is implicitly satisfied because the pairs of numbers that appear twice will have an XOR of `0` with themselves, and the additional individual numbers are chosen such that the total number of elements in `l` and `r` are `2k`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles cases where `k` is small and large, and where the numbers in `a` are distributed in various ways.
  - The program ensures that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed the given constraints.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly constructs `l` and `r` based on the problem constraints and guarantees that the XOR of the elements in `l` equals the XOR of the elements in `r`.

**Correctness: True**
