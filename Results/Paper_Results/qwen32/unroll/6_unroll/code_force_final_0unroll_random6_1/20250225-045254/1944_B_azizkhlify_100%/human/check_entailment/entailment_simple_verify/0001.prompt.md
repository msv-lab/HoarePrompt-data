You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
- The goal is to split the array `a` into two subsets `l` and `r` of size `2k` each, such that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` equals the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`.
- The array `a` is of length `2n` and contains each integer from `1` to `n` exactly twice.
- The program needs to handle multiple test cases.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.

2. **Counting Elements in the First and Second Half:**
   - It initializes two lists `l` and `r` of size `n` to count occurrences of each element in the first and second halves of `a`, respectively.
   - It also initializes counters `re`, `ul`, `ur`, and a list `res`.

3. **Filling Subset `l`:**
   - It iterates through the first half of `a` and fills `l` with counts of each element.
   - It then iterates through the second half of `a` and fills `r` with counts of each element.
   - It starts filling subset `l` by adding pairs of elements that appear twice in the first half.
   - If it has added `2k` elements to `l`, it breaks out of the loop.

4. **Adjusting `k` and Filling Remaining Elements in `l`:**
   - It adjusts `k` to account for the remaining elements needed to reach `2k` in `l`.
   - It then fills `l` with single occurrences of elements from the first half until it has `2k` elements.
   - It also keeps track of these elements in `res`.

5. **Printing Subset `l`:**
   - It prints the elements of `l` which are pairs of elements that appear twice and single elements that were added to reach `2k`.

6. **Filling Subset `r`:**
   - It prints the elements of `res` as part of subset `r`.
   - If `l` and `r` do not have the same number of elements yet, it adds pairs of elements that appear twice in the second half of `a` to `r` until `l` and `r` have the same number of elements.

7. **Printing Subset `r`:**
   - It prints the elements of `r`.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not ensure that the bitwise XOR of `l` and `r` is equal, which is a crucial requirement.
- The program does not handle the case where the XOR of `l` and `r` needs to be equal correctly.
- The logic for filling `l` and `r` with the correct elements to ensure the XOR condition is missing.

### Correctness:
Given the analysis, the program does not guarantee that the bitwise XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` will be equal, which is a fundamental requirement of the problem. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
