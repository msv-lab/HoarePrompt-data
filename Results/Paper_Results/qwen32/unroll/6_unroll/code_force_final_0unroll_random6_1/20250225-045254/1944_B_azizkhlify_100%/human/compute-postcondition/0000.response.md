The loop head in the provided for loop is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is the value obtained from `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations the loop will execute.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= floor(n/2).
- `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.

The loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The loop head only needs to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000**.
