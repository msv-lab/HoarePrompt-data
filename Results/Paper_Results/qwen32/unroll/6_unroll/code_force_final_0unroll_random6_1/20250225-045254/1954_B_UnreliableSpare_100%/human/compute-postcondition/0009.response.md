The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the variable `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. 

Since `ans` is initially the minimum length of consecutive occurrences of `arr[0]` before the last sequence (or `Decimal('Infinity')` if no such sequence exists), and `cnt` is the count of the last consecutive sequence of `val` at the end of `arr`, the new value of `ans` will be the smaller of these two values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is False; `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`; `val` is `arr[0]`; `cnt` is the count of the last consecutive sequence of `val` at the end of `arr` (if any).**
