The code snippet assigns `arr[0]` to the variable `val` and `0` to the variable `cnt`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `flag`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is False; `ans` is Decimal('Infinity'); `val` is `arr[0]`; `cnt` is 0.**
