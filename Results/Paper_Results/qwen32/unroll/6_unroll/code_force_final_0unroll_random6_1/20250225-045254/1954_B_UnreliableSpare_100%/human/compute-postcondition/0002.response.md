The given code snippet only initializes the variable `flag` to `True`. It does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `arr`. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state except for the newly introduced `flag` variable.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `flag` is True.**
