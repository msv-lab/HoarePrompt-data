The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is:

```python
print(-1)
```

This statement directly prints the integer `-1` regardless of the values of any other variables in the program. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `flag`, `ans`, `val`, and `cnt` do not influence the output of this specific `print` statement because it explicitly prints the value `-1`.

Therefore, based on the given initial state and the code snippet, the output will be:

Output: **-1**
