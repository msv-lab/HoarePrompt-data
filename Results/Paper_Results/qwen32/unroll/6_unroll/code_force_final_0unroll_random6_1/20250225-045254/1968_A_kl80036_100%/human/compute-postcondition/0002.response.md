Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` where 1 <= `t` <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each of the following `t` lines, it accepts an integer `x` where 2 <= `x` <= 1000. The function processes each `x` and returns a result based on the value of `x` for each test case.**
