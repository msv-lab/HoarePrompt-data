The function `count_zero` is not directly related to the problem description provided. Based on the problem description, the inputs are: t (number of test cases), for each test case, n (number of integers in the list), m (parameter determining when Sasha wins), and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The constraints are 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
