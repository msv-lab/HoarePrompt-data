Let's break down the provided code snippet and understand what it does based on the initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` is an integer representing the length of the string `s`.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-'.
- `neg` is the number of '-' characters in the string `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Condition Check (`n != neg`)**:
   - If `n` (the length of the string) is not equal to `neg` (the number of '-' characters in the string), the expression `n - 2 * neg` is evaluated and printed.
   - If `n` is equal to `neg`, the expression `n` is evaluated and printed.

2. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - `n - 2 * neg`: This expression subtracts twice the number of '-' characters from the total length of the string. This can be interpreted as counting the number of '+' characters and subtracting the number of '-' characters from the string, then doubling the result of the '-' characters to account for their negative contribution.
   - If `n == neg`, it means the string consists entirely of '-' characters. In this case, the entire length of the string is printed.

### Output Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1**: If the string `s` contains both '+' and '-' characters (i.e., `n != neg`):
  - The output will be the result of `n - 2 * neg`, which represents the net count of '+' characters minus the count of '-' characters, where each '-' character contributes a negative count of 2.

- **Scenario 2**: If the string `s` contains only '-' characters (i.e., `n == neg`):
  - The output will be `n`, which is the total length of the string.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the result of the expression `n - 2 * neg` if the length of the string `n` is not equal to the number of '-' characters `neg`. If `n` is equal to `neg`, it will output `n`.

Output: **n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n (where n is the length of the string s and neg is the number of '-' characters in the string s)**
