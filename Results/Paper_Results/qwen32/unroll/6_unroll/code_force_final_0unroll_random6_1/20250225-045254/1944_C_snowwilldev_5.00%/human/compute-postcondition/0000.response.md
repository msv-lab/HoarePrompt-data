In the provided task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop variable `tc` will take on values from 0 up to, but not including, `t`. To ensure the loop executes, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

The other variables `n` and `a` are defined within the loop body and do not affect whether the loop itself will execute. Therefore, we only need to adjust the state of `t`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop `for tc in range(int(input())):` will execute if and only if `t` (which is the integer input) is greater than 0.
2. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4`, which means the loop will execute as long as the input is within this range.
3. Since the state already specifies that `1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4`, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts is already suitable for the loop to execute. 

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4**
