### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program in detail to determine if the program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.

#### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a`.
- Alice starts with an empty array `c`.
- They take turns picking elements from `a` and appending them to `c` (Alice) or removing them from `a` (Bob).
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c` while Bob wants to minimize it.
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to determine the MEX by counting the occurrences of each element in the array `a` and then finding the smallest index `i` such that either the count of `i` in the list `a` is zero or at least two unique elements in `a` appear exactly once.

Here's the program again for reference:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        t = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break
```

#### Evaluation of the Program:
1. **Counting Elements**:
   - The program correctly counts the occurrences of each element in the array `a` using a `defaultdict`.

2. **Determining the MEX**:
   - The program then iterates through the numbers from `0` to `N-1` and checks two conditions:
     - If the count of the current number `i` is zero, it prints `i` and breaks.
     - If the count of the current number `i` is one, it increments a counter `t`.
     - If `t` reaches 2 (indicating that at least two unique elements appear exactly once), it prints `i` and breaks.
   
   - This logic does not correctly simulate the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. The MEX should be determined based on the final state of `c` after all elements have been picked and removed optimally.

3. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the test case:
     ```
     1
     5
     0 1 2 3 4
     ```
     - The correct MEX should be `5` because all numbers from `0` to `4` are present in the array.
     - However, the program will output `0` because `cnt[0] == 1` and `t` will be incremented, leading to an incorrect result.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice and Bob play optimally. Alice will try to maximize the MEX by picking elements that are not yet in `c` and are not picked by Bob.
   - Bob will try to minimize the MEX by picking elements that Alice might pick to maximize the MEX.
   - The correct way to determine the MEX is to simulate the game and keep track of the elements in `c` after each move.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly determine the MEX based on the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. The logic used to determine the MEX is flawed and does not simulate the game correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
