Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to split the array `a` into two subsequences `s` and `t` such that every element of `a` is in either `s` or `t`.
- The penalty `p(b)` for a subsequence `b` is the number of indices `i` where `b[i] < b[i+1]`.
- Our goal is to minimize the total penalty `p(s) + p(t)`.

### Key Points:
- The subsequences `s` and `t` can be empty.
- The elements of `s` and `t` should be subsequences of `a`, meaning they can be obtained by deleting some elements from `a` without changing the order of the remaining elements.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes two lists `a` and `b` to store the subsequences.
   - It also initializes `cp` to 0, but this variable is not used anywhere in the program.

2. **Splitting the Array**:
   - The program iterates over each element in the array `lit`.
   - It checks the last elements of `a` and `b` to decide which subsequence to add the current element to. The logic here seems flawed because it doesn't guarantee an optimal split that minimizes the penalty.
   - For example, the conditions `if x > y`, `elif x == y`, and `elif x < y` are not clearly defined for the optimal split. The conditions inside these blocks also do not guarantee the minimum penalty.

3. **Calculating the Penalty**:
   - After splitting the array, the program calculates the penalty for both subsequences `a` and `b`.
   - It iterates through each subsequence and counts the number of times an element is less than the next one.
   - Finally, it prints the total penalty.

### Flaws in the Program:
- The logic used to split the array into subsequences `a` and `b` is not optimal. The program does not ensure that the split minimizes the total penalty.
- The conditions for adding elements to `a` or `b` do not guarantee an optimal solution.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not ensure an optimal split of the array to minimize the penalty.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
