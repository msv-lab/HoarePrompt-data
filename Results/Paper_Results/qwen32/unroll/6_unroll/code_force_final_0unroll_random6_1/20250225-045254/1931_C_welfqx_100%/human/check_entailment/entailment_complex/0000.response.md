### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine the minimum number of burles (which corresponds to the number of elements that need to be changed) to make all elements in the array equal by using a single operation. The operation allows changing a contiguous subarray to a single value, and the cost of the operation is the length of the subarray.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. **Initial Check**:
   - The program first checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same). If so, it prints `0` because no operation is needed.
   - This is done by iterating through the array and checking if any two consecutive elements are different. If they are, it sets a flag `f` to `0` and breaks the loop.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If the array has only one element (`n == 1`), it also prints `0` because no operation is needed.
   - If the array is uniform (`f == 1`), it prints `0`.

3. **Reverse and Compare**:
   - The program then creates a reversed copy of the array `onum`.
   - It calculates the length of the longest prefix of the original array that consists of the same element (`cn`).
   - Similarly, it calculates the length of the longest prefix of the reversed array that consists of the same element (`ck`).

4. **Combining Results**:
   - If the first and last elements of the array are the same (`symb1 == symb2`), it adds `ck` to `cn` because this means there might be a contiguous segment that can be extended by combining the prefix and suffix.
   - Finally, it prints `n - max(cn, ck)`, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the entire array uniform.

### Analysis of the Correctness:

- **Uniform Array**: If the array is already uniform, the program correctly outputs `0`.
- **Single Operation**: The program considers the longest contiguous segments at the start and end of the array that can be made uniform with a single operation.
- **Combining Segments**: If the first and last elements are the same, the program correctly combines these segments to find the longest contiguous segment that can be made uniform.
- **Output**: The output `n - max(cn, ck)` correctly represents the minimum number of elements that need to be changed.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of burles required to make all elements in the array equal using a single operation.

**Correctness: True**
