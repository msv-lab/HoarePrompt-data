Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle. The code does not use the triangle inequality theorem, which is necessary to determine if three sides can form a triangle.

The triangle inequality theorem states that for three sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (where \(a \leq b \leq c\)), they can form a triangle if and only if \(a + b > c\).

The given code only counts combinations of sticks without checking the triangle inequality condition. Specifically, it counts combinations where at least two or three sticks have the same length, but it does not check if the lengths of the sticks satisfy the triangle inequality theorem.

Here's an example where the program will fail:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```
Explanation: The lengths of the sticks are \(2^1 = 2\), \(2^2 = 4\), and \(2^3 = 8\). These lengths do not satisfy the triangle inequality theorem because \(2 + 4 \not> 8\).

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```
Explanation: The code will count this as a valid combination because it has three sticks, but it does not check if they can form a triangle.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
