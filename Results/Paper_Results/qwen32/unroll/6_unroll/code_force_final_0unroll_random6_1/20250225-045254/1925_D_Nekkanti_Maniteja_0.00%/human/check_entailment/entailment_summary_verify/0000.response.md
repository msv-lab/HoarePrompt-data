### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the original assessment systematically based on the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
- Friendship values increase by 1 for all subsequent excursions if a pair of friends is chosen.
- The answer should be expressed as `p * q^-1 % (10^9 + 7)` where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.

#### Given Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)
```

##### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Probability**:
   - `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1`, which is incorrect. It should be the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` (the total number of possible pairs).
   - The code does not correctly use `c` in the subsequent calculations. The probability of choosing a particular friend pair in one excursion is `1 / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`.

2. **Incorrect Summation Logic**:
   - The code attempts to sum the expected values but does not correctly account for the increasing friendship values over the `k` excursions.
   - The expected value for each friend pair should be calculated based on the probability of choosing that pair and the increasing friendship value.

3. **Ignoring Individual Friendship Values**:
   - The code sums up all the initial friendship values in `a` but does not differentiate between different pairs. It should calculate the expected contribution of each pair separately and then sum them up.

4. **Modular Arithmetic Errors**:
   - The code does not handle modular arithmetic correctly in the summation part. The summation should be done modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at each step to prevent overflow and ensure correctness.

#### Corrected Version:
The corrected version provided in the original assessment addresses these issues:
- It calculates the probability of choosing any pair correctly.
- It calculates the expected value contribution of each pair separately.
- It handles modular arithmetic correctly.

#### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem as described. The original assessment accurately identifies the issues and provides a corrected version of the logic.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
