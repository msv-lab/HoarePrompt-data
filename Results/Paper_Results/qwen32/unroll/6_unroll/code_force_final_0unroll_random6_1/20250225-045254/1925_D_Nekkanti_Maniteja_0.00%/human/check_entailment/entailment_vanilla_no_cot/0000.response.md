Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Let's break down why it is incorrect:

1. **Calculation of `c`**: The program calculates `c` as the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). However, `n * (n - 1) // 2` is the total number of possible pairs among `n` children, and it is used to normalize the probability of choosing a specific pair. The value of `c` should be the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs, not the product of the number of children and the number of children minus one divided by one.

2. **Summation logic**: The program incorrectly computes the sum `s` by iterating `k` times and adding contributions from `c * i * c * m + c * a` to `s`. This logic does not correctly account for the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The correct approach involves calculating the expected contribution of each friendship pair over `k` excursions.

3. **Handling of friendship values**: The program simply sums the initial friendship values in `a` but does not account for the increase in friendship values over the `k` excursions. The expected increase in friendship values for each pair must be calculated based on the probability of being chosen and the number of excursions.

Here is a corrected approach:

- Calculate the probability of choosing each friendship pair in a single excursion, which is `1 / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`.
- For each friendship pair, calculate the expected increase in its friendship value over `k` excursions, which involves summing the probabilities of being chosen in each excursion.
- Sum the expected values for all friendship pairs and the non-friendship pairs (which remain 0).

The corrected program would involve more complex calculations, including the use of combinatorial sums and modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and ensure correctness.
