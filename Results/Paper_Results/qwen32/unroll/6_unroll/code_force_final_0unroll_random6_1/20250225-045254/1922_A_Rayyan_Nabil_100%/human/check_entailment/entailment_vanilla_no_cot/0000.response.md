Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine if there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not.

The logic in `func_1` is flawed. The condition `if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` only checks if the characters in `a` and `b` at position `i` are different from `c[i]`. However, this does not guarantee that `a[i]` and `b[i]` match a template where they are either the same (if the template character is lowercase) or different (if the template character is uppercase).

For example, consider the case where `a = "aa"`, `b = "bb"`, and `c = "aa"`. The program would return "YES" because `a[0] != c[0]` and `b[0] != c[0]`, but there is no template that can make both `a` and `b` match while `c` does not match.

The correct approach should be to check if there exists a template character for each position `i` that satisfies the conditions for `a`, `b`, and `c` as described in the problem statement. Specifically, for each position `i`, the template character should be either the uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`) if `a[i] == b[i]` and `a[i] != c[i]`, or any character that is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]` if `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. If such a template can be constructed for all positions, then the answer should be "YES"; otherwise, "NO".
