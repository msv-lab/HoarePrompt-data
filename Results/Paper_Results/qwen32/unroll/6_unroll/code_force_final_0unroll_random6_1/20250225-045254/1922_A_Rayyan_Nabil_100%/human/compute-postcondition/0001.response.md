The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `t` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initialization of `results` while keeping the initial conditions of the other variables intact.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 20), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, `t` is an input integer, `results` is an empty list.**
