Let's analyze the provided Python program in detail to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:

- We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that:
  - Strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
  - String `c` does not match the template `t`.

- For a string to match a template:
  - If the template character is lowercase, the corresponding string character must be the same.
  - If the template character is uppercase, the corresponding string character must be different from the lowercase version of the template character.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:

1. **Function `func_1(n, a, b, c)`**:
   - This function iterates over each character position `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - It checks if `a[i]` is different from `c[i]` and `b[i]` is different from `c[i]`.
   - If such a position is found, it returns `'YES'`, indicating that a template exists where `a` and `b` match the template but `c` does not.
   - If no such position is found after the loop, it returns `'NO'`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n`, and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It calls `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each test case and stores the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Correctness of the Provided Program:

The provided program is incorrect. Here's why:

- The logic inside `func_1` is flawed. The function checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, which is not sufficient to determine if a template exists where `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not.
- The template can have uppercase letters, which would mean that `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of the template character at position `i`.
- The provided logic does not consider the possibility of using uppercase letters in the template to ensure `a` and `b` match while `c` does not.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to construct a template `t` such that:
- For each position `i`, if `a[i] == b[i]`, then `t[i]` can be the uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`), ensuring `c[i]` does not match.
- If `a[i] != b[i]`, then `t[i]` can be `a[i]` (or `b[i]`), ensuring both `a` and `b` match while `c` does not if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to determine the existence of such a template. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
