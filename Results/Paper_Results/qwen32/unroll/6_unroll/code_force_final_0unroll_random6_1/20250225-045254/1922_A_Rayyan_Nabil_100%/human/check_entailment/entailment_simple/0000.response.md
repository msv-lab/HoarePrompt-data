Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether there exists a template such that strings `a` and `b` match it while string `c` does not. The given solution checks each position in the strings to see if there is at least one position where `a` and `b` differ from `c`. If such a position exists, it returns 'YES', implying that a template can be constructed where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not. If no such position exists, it returns 'NO'.

Let's analyze the provided code:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It iterates through each character position `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - For each position, it checks if `a[i]` is different from `c[i]` and `b[i]` is different from `c[i]`.
   - If both conditions are met for any position, it returns 'YES'.
   - If the loop completes without finding such a position, it returns 'NO'.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It calls `func_1` with `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

The logic in `func_1` correctly implements the problem's requirements. If there exists at least one position where `a` and `b` differ from `c`, a template can be constructed where `a` and `b` match the template (using the uppercase version of the differing character) and `c` does not match (since it uses the lowercase version).

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
