Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves a card game where:
- There are `2n` cards, with integers from `1` to `n` appearing exactly twice.
- Cards are distributed between two players, each receiving `n` cards.
- Players take turns placing cards on a table.
- A player scores a point if they place a card that already has a matching card on the table.
- Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can score if you play optimally.

### Key Observations

1. **Matching Pairs:** Since each number from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice, there are `n` pairs of cards.
2. **Turns:** You and Nene each take `n` turns, making a total of `2n` turns.
3. **Optimal Play:** Nene will play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. This means she will try to place cards that will allow her to score points while preventing you from scoring.

### Strategy for You

To maximize your score, you should:
- Try to place cards that will not immediately allow Nene to score points.
- Aim to place cards that will eventually allow you to score points.

### Counting Points

The maximum number of points you can score is determined by the number of pairs of cards you have that can be played in such a way that you score points. Specifically, if you have `k` pairs of cards, the maximum number of points you can score is `k-1` (since the last pair will be played by Nene).

### Program Analysis

The provided program reads the input and for each test case, calculates the number of points you can score by simply counting the number of duplicate cards in your hand and subtracting the number of unique cards.

Here's the program logic:
```python
def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
        print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))
```

- `[*open(0)][2::2]` reads every second line starting from the third line (skipping the first line which contains the number of test cases and the `n` value for each test case).
- `tokens := line.split()` splits the line into tokens (card numbers).
- `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})` calculates the number of duplicate cards by subtracting the number of unique cards from the total number of cards.

### Correctness

The logic in the program is incorrect because it does not account for the optimal play by Nene. The program simply counts the number of duplicate cards, which does not guarantee the maximum number of points you can score given Nene's optimal strategy.

For example, consider the first test case:
- Cards: `1 1 2 3`
- The program will output `1` because there is one duplicate card (two `1`s).
- However, the optimal play by Nene can prevent you from scoring more than `1` point.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum number of points you can score given Nene's optimal strategy. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
