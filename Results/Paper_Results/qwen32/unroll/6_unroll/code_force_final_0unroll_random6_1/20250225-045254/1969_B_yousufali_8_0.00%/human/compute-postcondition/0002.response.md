To determine the output state, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and the function `func_1()`. The loop runs `t` times, calling `func_1()` during each iteration. However, since the code snippet does not specify what `func_1()` does, we can only infer the state of the variables that are directly involved in the loop.

In this code, the variable `t` is used to control the number of iterations of the loop. The loop variable `_` is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. Since `func_1()` is called `t` times, the effect on the system will depend on what `func_1()` does, but the loop control variable `t` itself will remain unchanged after the loop completes.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged from the initial input integer.**
