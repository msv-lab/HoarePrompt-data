### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided functions and their behavior to determine if they correctly solve the problem.

#### Function 1 (`func_1`):
- **Code Analysis**:
  - The function reads a list of integers from the input, which are expected to be binary digits (0s and 1s).
  - It initializes two variables: `n` (to count the number of 1s encountered) and `ans` (to accumulate the cost).
  - It iterates through the list:
    - If it encounters a 1, it increments `n`.
    - If it encounters a 0 after any 1s (i.e., `n` is not zero), it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
  - Finally, it prints the accumulated cost `ans`.

- **Output Hints**:
  - The function calculates the cost based on the number of 1s encountered before each 0. The cost is incremented by `n + 1` for each such occurrence, where `n` is the number of 1s encountered so far.

- **Correctness Evaluation**:
  - The logic seems to be attempting to calculate the cost based on the number of 1s before each 0, but the formula `n + 1` does not align with the problem's requirement of calculating the cost as the length of the substring being cyclically shifted.
  - The cost should be the length of the substring containing the 1s and the 0, which is not what `n + 1` represents.
  - Therefore, `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`):
- **Code Analysis**:
  - The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
  - It then calls `func_1` `t` times, presumably to process each test case.

- **Output Hints**:
  - The function does not modify the input or output; it simply orchestrates the execution of `func_1` for each test case.

- **Correctness Evaluation**:
  - Since `func_1` is incorrect, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results because it relies on `func_1` to compute the cost for each test case.

### Conclusion:
Given that `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string according to the problem's requirements, the entire program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
