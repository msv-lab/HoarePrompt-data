### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code again to ensure the correctness.

The problem states that Alice and Bob play optimally. Here are the key points to consider:

1. **If `a == b`**: Bob wins. This is because, regardless of the strategy, the game will eventually reach a state where both have the same number of coins, and Bob will make the last move.
2. **If `a == 1`**: Alice wins. Alice can take the last coin from her wallet, and Bob will have no valid move.
3. **If `b == 1`**: Bob wins. Bob can take the last coin from his wallet, and Alice will have no valid move.
4. **If `a` is odd**: Bob wins. If `a` is odd, Alice will always be the one to face an odd number of coins, and Bob can always force Alice into a losing position.
5. **If `a` is even and `b` is odd**: Alice wins. Alice can start by swapping wallets, making `a` odd and `b` even, and then force Bob into a losing position.
6. **If `a > b`**: Bob wins. Bob can always force Alice into a losing position by maintaining an optimal strategy.
7. **Otherwise**: Alice wins. This covers the case where `a < b` and `a` is even, and `b` is even. Alice can always force Bob into a losing position.

Now, let's evaluate the code against these points:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

Let's verify each condition:

1. **`a == b`**: The code correctly prints 'Bob'.
2. **`a == 1`**: The code correctly prints 'Alice'.
3. **`b == 1`**: The code correctly prints 'Bob'.
4. **`a` is odd**: The code correctly prints 'Bob'.
5. **`a` is even and `b` is odd**: The code correctly prints 'Alice'.
6. **`a > b`**: The code correctly prints 'Bob'.
7. **Otherwise**: The code correctly prints 'Alice'.

The original assessment appears to be accurate. The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all the test cases provided in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
