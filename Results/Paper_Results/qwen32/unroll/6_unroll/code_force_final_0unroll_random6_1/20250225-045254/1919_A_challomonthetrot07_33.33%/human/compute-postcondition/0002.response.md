To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand the logic of the loop and how it processes each test case.

The loop runs `T` times, and for each iteration, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. Based on the values of `a` and `b`, it prints the name of the winner according to the given conditions. The conditions and their corresponding outputs are:

1. If `a == b`, print 'Bob'.
2. If `a == 1`, print 'Alice'.
3. If `b == 1`, print 'Bob'.
4. If `a` is odd, print 'Bob'.
5. If `a` is even and `b` is odd, print 'Alice'.
6. If `a > b`, print 'Bob'.
7. Otherwise, print 'Alice'.

Since the loop only prints the result for each test case and does not modify any variables outside of its scope, the output state will simply be a series of printed results, one for each test case. The variables `T`, `a`, and `b` will be in their final state after the loop, but since `a` and `b` are reassigned in each iteration, their final values will be the values from the last test case.

However, the primary focus of the output state is the series of printed results, which is not stored in a variable but rather output to the console.

Output State: **A series of printed results ('Alice' or 'Bob') corresponding to each test case. The variables `T`, `a`, and `b` will be in their final state, with `T` unchanged and `a` and `b` holding the values from the last test case.**
