Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from an array `a` and placing them into another array `c` (Alice) or removing them from `a` (Bob).
- Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c` at the end of the game.
- Bob aims to minimize the MEX of `c` at the end of the game.
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Strategy:
- To maximize the MEX, Alice should try to include as many consecutive integers starting from 0 in `c` as possible.
- To minimize the MEX, Bob should try to prevent Alice from including these integers.

### Optimal Play:
- The optimal strategy involves analyzing the counts of each number in `a`.
- If a number `i` appears more than once, Alice can pick one of these numbers and place it in `c` on her turn.
- If a number `i` appears exactly once, Alice should pick it on her turn if it is her first turn to pick a unique number. This ensures that she can maximize the MEX by including as many unique numbers as possible.
- Bob's strategy is to pick numbers that Alice has already placed in `c` or numbers that do not help Alice increase the MEX.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each number in `a`. It then iterates through the numbers from 0 to `n-1` to determine the MEX based on the following logic:
- If a number `i` is not in the `Counter`, it means `i` is not present in `a`, and hence `i` is the MEX.
- If a number `i` appears exactly once and it is Alice's first turn to pick a unique number (`first` is True), then `i` is the MEX.
- If a number `i` appears exactly once and it is Alice's first turn to pick a unique number (`first` is False), it sets `first` to True indicating that Alice has picked a unique number.

### Correctness Check:
Let's verify if this logic aligns with the optimal strategy:
- The program correctly identifies the smallest `i` that is not present in `a` or appears exactly once after Alice's first turn to pick a unique number.
- However, the logic does not account for the turns of Alice and Bob correctly. The program does not simulate the turns and does not ensure that Alice picks the numbers in an optimal way to maximize the MEX.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly simulate the turns of Alice and Bob and does not ensure that Alice picks the numbers in an optimal way to maximize the MEX. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
