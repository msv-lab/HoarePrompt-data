### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given Python program and the functions it uses to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n`.
   - We can perform operations to set a subarray to its MEX (smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray).
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array and provide the sequence of operations.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program starts by reading the input and initializing an empty list `ops` to store the operations.
   - It then calls `func_1` to find a pair `(r, l)` that maximizes the potential sum of the array if the subarray from `r` to `l` is set to its MEX.
   - It enters a loop that continues until `r == l`. In each iteration, it calls `func_3` to perform the operation and updates `(r, l)`.
   - After the loop, it tries to replace any `0` in the array with `1` and appends the corresponding operation.
   - Finally, it prints the sum of the array and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**: This function checks all subarrays and selects the one that, if set to its MEX, would maximize the sum of the array. It does this by calculating the potential new sum for each subarray and updating `r` and `l` accordingly.
   - **`func_2`**: This function is recursive and appends operations to `ops` to set the subarray from `r` to `l` to its MEX. However, the logic here seems flawed because it recursively calls itself with `l - 1` and appends redundant operations.
   - **`func_3`**: This function appends an operation to `ops` to set the subarray from `r` to `l` to its MEX, performs the operation by setting the subarray to `l - r + 1`, and then calls `func_2` to append more operations.

4. **Issues Identified**:
   - **`func_2`**: The recursive nature of this function can lead to a large number of redundant operations, which is inefficient and may not be necessary.
   - **`func_3`**: The call to `func_2` within `func_3` adds unnecessary operations and does not correctly reflect the intended logic.
   - **Overall Logic**: The program's logic for maximizing the sum is flawed because it does not correctly implement the MEX operation and does not guarantee an optimal sequence of operations.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to maximize the sum of the array. The recursive calls in `func_2` and the way `func_3` calls `func_2` add unnecessary operations and do not correctly reflect the MEX operation.

**Correctness: False**
