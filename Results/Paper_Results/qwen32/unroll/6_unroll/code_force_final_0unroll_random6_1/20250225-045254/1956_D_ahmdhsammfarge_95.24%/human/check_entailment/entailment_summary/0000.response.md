### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided code and its functions to determine if they meet the problem requirements.

1. **Function `func_1(lst)`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to find two indices `r` and `l` (where `r <= l`) that maximize the sum of the array if the sublist `lst[r:l+1]` is replaced by a sublist of the same length filled with the MEX of the sublist.
   - The function iterates over all possible sublists and calculates a hypothetical sum if the sublist is replaced by its MEX value squared (since the MEX value will be the length of the sublist if all values from 0 to `len(sublist) - 1` are present).
   - For the given example, it returns `(0, 3)`, which means the best operation is to replace the entire list with the MEX value of the entire list.

2. **Function `func_2(r, l, ops)`**:
   - This function is designed to recursively add operations to the list `ops`.
   - However, it is not directly used in the main program flow as it is not called in the main loop. This function seems to be a placeholder or a part of a different solution strategy that is not utilized here.
   - It appends operations to `ops` in a recursive manner, but since it's not used, we can ignore it for the current problem.

3. **Function `func_3(r, l, lst, ops)`**:
   - This function is called in the main loop to perform the operation identified by `func_1`.
   - It appends the operation `[r+1, l+1]` to `ops` (to indicate the range to be replaced).
   - If the minimum value in the sublist is `0`, it appends another operation `[r+1, l+1]`.
   - It then appends `[r+1, r+1]` to `ops`.
   - Calls `func_2` (which is not used).
   - Appends another `[r+1, l+1]` to `ops`.
   - Finally, it replaces the sublist `lst[r:l+1]` with the length of the sublist `n` (the MEX value if all values from 0 to `n-1` are present).

4. **Main Program**:
   - The main program starts by reading the input list.
   - It initializes an empty list `ops` to store operations.
   - It repeatedly calls `func_1` to find the best operation and then `func_3` to perform the operation until no further improvement can be made.
   - After the main loop, it attempts to replace any `0` in the list with `1` and records the operation.
   - Finally, it prints the sum of the modified list and the number of operations.

### Issues:
- The main issue is that the function `func_1` does not correctly identify the MEX value for the sublist. It incorrectly assumes the MEX value is the length of the sublist, which is not always true.
- The function `func_3` does not correctly implement the MEX operation. It should replace the sublist with the MEX value, not the length of the sublist.
- The use of `func_2` is unnecessary and does not contribute to the solution.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions and main program do not correctly implement the required operations to maximize the sum of the array based on the MEX value. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
