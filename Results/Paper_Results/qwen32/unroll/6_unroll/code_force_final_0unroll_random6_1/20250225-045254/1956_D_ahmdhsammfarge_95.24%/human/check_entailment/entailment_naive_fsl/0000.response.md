Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array by performing the allowed operations. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function tries to find the optimal range `[l, r]` to perform the MEX operation on. However, the logic to calculate the sum `sm` is incorrect. The sum `sm` should be calculated based on the MEX value of the subarray, not just the square of the length of the subarray.
   - The MEX value should be calculated for the subarray `lst[i:j+1]`, and then the sum should be updated based on this MEX value. The current implementation does not correctly compute the MEX value.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function seems to be intended to generate a sequence of operations, but it does not correctly generate the operations needed to maximize the sum. It recursively calls itself and appends operations without ensuring that these operations actually maximize the sum.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function attempts to apply the MEX operation on the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` and update the operations list. However, it does not correctly compute the MEX value and does not ensure that the operations are optimal.
   - The function also contains redundant operations and does not correctly update the array `lst` to reflect the MEX operation.

### Example of Incorrectness:

Let's consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```

The expected output is:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```

However, the provided code does not generate the correct sequence of operations to achieve this output. The MEX value for the subarray `[2, 1]` should be `0`, and then for the subarray `[0, 1]` should be `2`. The code does not correctly compute these MEX values and does not generate the correct operations.

### Conclusion:

The code does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array by performing the allowed operations. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
