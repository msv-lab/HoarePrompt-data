Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to maximize the sum of an array by repeatedly performing an operation that sets a subarray to its MEX value. The MEX (minimum excluded value) of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

### Code Analysis
Let's break down the provided code and its annotated version to understand its logic and correctness.

#### Function `func_1`
This function attempts to find the optimal range `[l, r]` to perform the MEX operation on. It iterates through all possible subarrays and calculates a sum `sm` based on the square of the subarray length. However, this sum `sm` does not correctly reflect the MEX value of the subarray. The MEX value should be calculated for the subarray `lst[i:j+1]`, and the sum should be updated based on this MEX value.

**Issue:** The sum `sm` is calculated as `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`, which is incorrect. It should be based on the MEX value of the subarray.

#### Function `func_2`
This function seems to be intended to generate a sequence of operations. However, it does not correctly generate the operations needed to maximize the sum. It recursively calls itself and appends operations without ensuring that these operations actually maximize the sum.

**Issue:** The function does not correctly generate the operations needed to maximize the sum.

#### Function `func_3`
This function attempts to apply the MEX operation on the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` and update the operations list. However, it does not correctly compute the MEX value and does not ensure that the operations are optimal.

**Issue:** The function does not correctly compute the MEX value and does not ensure that the operations are optimal.

### Annotated Code Analysis
The annotated code provides additional insights into the state of the program at key points. However, the annotations do not reflect the correct logic for computing the MEX value or generating optimal operations.

**Issue:** The annotations do not reflect the correct logic for computing the MEX value or generating optimal operations.

### Example of Incorrectness
Let's consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```

The expected output is:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```

However, the provided code does not generate the correct sequence of operations to achieve this output. The MEX value for the subarray `[2, 1]` should be `0`, and then for the subarray `[0, 1]` should be `2`. The code does not correctly compute these MEX values and does not generate the correct operations.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array by performing the allowed operations. The issues identified in the original assessment are valid.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The code is incorrect as it does not properly compute the MEX values or generate the correct sequence of operations to maximize the sum of the array.
