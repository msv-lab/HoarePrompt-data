Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to maximize the sum of an array by performing a series of operations that replace a subarray with its MEX (Minimum Excluded Value). The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set. The constraint is that we can perform the operation no more than \(5 \times 10^5\) times.

### Program Analysis:

#### Function 1 (`func_1`):
- **Purpose**: To find the subarray that, when replaced with its MEX, maximizes the sum of the array.
- **Logic**: It iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the sum of the array if the subarray is replaced with its MEX. It keeps track of the subarray that results in the maximum sum.
- **Implementation**: The function calculates the sum of the array excluding the subarray and adds the square of the length of the subarray (which is the sum if the subarray is replaced with its MEX, assuming the MEX is the length of the subarray). It updates the maximum sum and the indices of the subarray if a better sum is found.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`):
- **Purpose**: To generate a sequence of operations that replace a subarray with its MEX.
- **Logic**: It recursively generates operations to replace the subarray from `r` to `l` with its MEX.
- **Implementation**: The function is recursive and seems to be designed to generate the operations in a specific order, but the logic is not clear and may not be correct for all cases.

#### Function 3 (`func_3`):
- **Purpose**: To perform the operation on the subarray and update the list and operations.
- **Logic**: It appends operations to the list and updates the subarray in the list.
- **Implementation**: The function appends multiple operations, some of which seem redundant and may not be necessary. It also updates the subarray to the length of the subarray, which is not necessarily the MEX.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**: The program assumes the MEX of a subarray is the length of the subarray, which is not always true. The MEX should be calculated based on the actual elements in the subarray.
2. **Redundant Operations**: The program appends multiple operations that may not be necessary, leading to incorrect results and unnecessary complexity.
3. **Incorrect Logic in `func_2`**: The recursive function `func_2` does not correctly generate the operations to replace the subarray with its MEX.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array by replacing subarrays with their MEX. The calculation of MEX is incorrect, and the logic for generating operations is flawed.

**Correctness: False**
