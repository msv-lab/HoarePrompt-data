### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, the program code, and the annotated version.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to maximize the sum of an array by performing operations that replace a subarray with its MEX (minimum excluded non-negative integer).
- The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.
- We need to output the maximum sum and the sequence of operations that achieves this sum.

#### Analysis of the Provided Code:

##### Function 1: `func_1(lst)`
- **Purpose**: To find the optimal subarray `[l, r]` to replace with its MEX to maximize the sum.
- **Implementation**: It checks all possible subarrays and computes a new sum if that subarray were replaced by its MEX.
- **Issue**: The new sum is calculated incorrectly. It does not compute the actual MEX but instead calculates a sum based on the length of the subarray `(j - i + 1) ** 2`. This is a critical flaw because the MEX is not considered, and the sum calculation is incorrect.

##### Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`
- **Purpose**: To generate a sequence of operations to set all elements in a subarray to a specific value.
- **Implementation**: The function is recursive and appends operations to the `ops` list. However, the operations are repetitive and do not correspond to setting the subarray to its MEX.
- **Issue**: The operations are not correct and do not reflect the intended MEX replacement.

##### Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`
- **Purpose**: To perform the actual replacement of the subarray `[r, l]` with its MEX.
- **Implementation**: It appends operations to the `ops` list and modifies the list `lst` in place. However, it does not compute the MEX correctly.
- **Issue**: Instead of computing the MEX, it sets all elements in the subarray to the length of the subarray `(l - r + 1)`. This is incorrect.

##### Annotated Code:
- **State Analysis**:
  - `func_1(lst)` is called to find the optimal subarray `[l, r]` to replace.
  - `func_3(r, l, lst, ops)` is called to perform the replacement and generate operations.
  - The process repeats until no further improvements are possible.
  - The final sum and operations are printed.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The code does not correctly compute the MEX of any subarray. Instead, it uses the length of the subarray to replace its elements.
2. **Incorrect Operation Generation**: The operations generated by `func_2` and `func_3` are not correct and do not correspond to the intended MEX replacement.
3. **Logic Flaws**: The logic in `func_1` for finding the optimal subarray to replace is flawed because it does not correctly compute the MEX.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as it does not properly compute the MEX of subarrays and does not generate the correct sequence of operations to maximize the sum of the array.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: False**
