### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its functions to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Main Program:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the integer `n` and the list of integers `lst`.
2. **Initialization**: Initializes an empty list `ops` to store operations.
3. **Finding Optimal Range**: The program calls `func_1(lst)` to find the range `[r, l]` that maximizes the sum when the MEX operation is applied.
4. **Applying MEX Operation**: The program enters a loop where it repeatedly applies the MEX operation on the range `[r, l]` until the range becomes invalid (i.e., `r == l`).
5. **Handling Zeros**: After the main loop, the program attempts to find any remaining zeros in the list and replaces them with 1, appending the corresponding operations to `ops`.
6. **Output**: The program prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the details of each operation.

#### Function `func_1(lst)`:
- **Purpose**: To find the range `[r, l]` that maximizes the sum when the MEX operation is applied.
- **Implementation**: It iterates over all possible ranges `[i, j]` and calculates the potential new sum if the MEX operation is applied on that range. It keeps track of the maximum sum and the corresponding range `[r, l]`.
- **State**: The function returns the range `[r, l]` that maximizes the sum.

#### Function `func_2(r, l, ops)`:
- **Purpose**: To generate a sequence of operations that sets all elements in the range `[r, l]` to the MEX value.
- **Implementation**: It recursively divides the range and appends the corresponding operations to `ops`.
- **State**: The function modifies `ops` to include the operations needed to set the range `[r, l]` to the MEX value.

#### Function `func_3(r, l, lst, ops)`:
- **Purpose**: To apply the MEX operation on the range `[r, l]` and update the list `lst`.
- **Implementation**: It appends the operation to `ops`, checks if the minimum value in the range is 0, and appends another operation if necessary. Then it calls `func_2` to generate the sequence of operations to set all elements in the range to the MEX value. Finally, it updates the list `lst` by setting all elements in the range `[r, l]` to the MEX value.
- **State**: The function modifies `lst` and `ops` to reflect the MEX operation.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Range Handling**: In `func_1`, the range `[r, l]` is found, but the indices are not correctly used in the subsequent operations. The loop in `func_1` incorrectly iterates over `j` starting from `i + 1`, which can lead to incorrect range selection.
2. **Inefficient Operation Generation**: The recursive approach in `func_2` is inefficient and can lead to a large number of operations, potentially exceeding the limit of `5 * 10^5`.
3. **Handling Zeros**: The approach to handle zeros is not optimal. It unnecessarily iterates over the list to find zeros, which can be inefficient.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem due to issues in range handling, inefficient operation generation, and suboptimal handling of zeros.

**Correctness: False**
