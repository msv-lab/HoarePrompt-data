The value of `x` is decremented by 1. The values of `t` and `X` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is the integer value provided by the user input minus 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is the integer value provided by the user input minus 1.**
