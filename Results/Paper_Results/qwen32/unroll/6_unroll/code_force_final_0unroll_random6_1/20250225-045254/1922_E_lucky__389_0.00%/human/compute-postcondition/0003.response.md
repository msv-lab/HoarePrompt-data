Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is the integer value provided by the user input minus 1; `subseq_lens` is an empty list; `mx` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `mx` has been set to 0. All other variables (`t`, `X`, `x`, and `subseq_lens`) remain unchanged.
