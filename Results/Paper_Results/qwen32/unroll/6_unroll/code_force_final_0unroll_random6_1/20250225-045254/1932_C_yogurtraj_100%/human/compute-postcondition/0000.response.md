The only variable in the loop head is `ii`, which is the loop variable for the `for` loop. The loop runs for `int(input())` iterations. To ensure that the loop executes, the input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer. 

Given the problem statement, `t` is the number of test cases and it is provided as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means that the input to `int(input())` will be `t`, and since `t` is guaranteed to be at least 1, the loop will execute.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, as `t` is already guaranteed to be a positive integer.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ii` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to t-1**
