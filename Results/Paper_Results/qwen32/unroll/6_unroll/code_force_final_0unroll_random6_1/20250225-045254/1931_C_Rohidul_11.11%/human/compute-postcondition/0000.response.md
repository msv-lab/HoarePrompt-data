In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the function `input()`. Therefore, the state of `t` is the only variable we can adjust to ensure the loop executes.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop is controlled by `t`, which is the number of iterations.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be at least 1.
3. The variables `n` and `a` are defined inside the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted in the initial state before the loop starts.

Given the constraints `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be set to at least 1.

Thus, the adjusted state before the loop starts should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4** (with the understanding that `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute). However, since the problem specifies `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, we can simply state that `t` is at least 1 to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` is at least 1**
