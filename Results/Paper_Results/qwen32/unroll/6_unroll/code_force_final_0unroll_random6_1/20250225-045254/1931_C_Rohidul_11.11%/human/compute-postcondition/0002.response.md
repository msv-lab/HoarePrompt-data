Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function returns a value based on the input for each test case. Specifically, for each test case, if the conditions are met (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), it processes the list `a` and returns a result. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
