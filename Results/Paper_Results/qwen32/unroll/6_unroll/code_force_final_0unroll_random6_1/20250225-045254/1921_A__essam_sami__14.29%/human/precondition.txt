testcases is a list of testcases where each testcase is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area. The number of testcases t satisfies 1 <= t <= 100.
