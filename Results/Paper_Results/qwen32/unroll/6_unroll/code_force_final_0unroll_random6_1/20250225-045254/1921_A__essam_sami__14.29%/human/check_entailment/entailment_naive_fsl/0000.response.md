Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the area of the square in all cases. The issue lies in the calculation of the side length of the square.

The program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points and prints the smaller of the two values. However, it does not guarantee that these points are diagonally opposite corners of the square. The program should calculate the squared distances between all pairs of points and find the largest distance, which corresponds to the diagonal of the square. The side length of the square can then be derived from the diagonal length.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
0 0
1 0
0 1
1 1
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

The program will calculate the squared distances between the points (0,0) and (1,0) which is 1, and between (0,0) and (0,1) which is also 1. It will then print 1, which is incorrect. The correct side length of the square is 1, and the area is 1.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for steps in range(t):
        points = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(4)]
        max_dist = 0
        for i in range(4):
            for j in range(i+1, 4):
                dist = (points[i][0] - points[j][0]) ** 2 + (points[i][1] - points[j][1]) ** 2
                max_dist = max(max_dist, dist)
        side_length = int(math.sqrt(max_dist))
        print(side_length ** 2)

```

This corrected program calculates the squared distance between all pairs of points and finds the maximum distance, which is the squared length of the diagonal. The side length of the square is then derived from the diagonal length, and the area is calculated accordingly.
