Correctness: **False**

The provided program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points and then prints the smaller of the two squared distances as the area of the square. However, this approach is incorrect because the area of the square should be the squared distance between any two adjacent points, not just any two points.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is incorrect and how it can be fixed:

1. **Incorrect Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points (a, b) and (e, f), and (c, d) and (g, h), and then prints the smaller of the two. This does not necessarily give the correct side length of the square because the points are not guaranteed to be adjacent.

2. **Correct Approach**: To find the area of the square, you need to find the squared distance between two adjacent points. Since the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length of the square can be found by calculating the absolute difference in the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of any two adjacent points.

3. **Implementation Fix**: You can sort the x and y coordinates separately and then find the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates) to get the side length of the square. The area will be the square of this side length.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for steps in range(t):
        points = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(4)]
        x_coords = sorted([point[0] for point in points])
        y_coords = sorted([point[1] for point in points])
        side_length = max(x_coords[3] - x_coords[0], y_coords[3] - y_coords[0])
        print(side_length * side_length)

func()
```

This corrected program reads the coordinates, sorts the x and y coordinates, calculates the side length of the square, and then prints the area.
