Precondition: **a and p are lists of integers of length n, where each element in p is a distinct integer between 1 and n (inclusive), s is a tuple of two integers (P_B, P_S) representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, and k is a non-negative integer representing the number of turns. n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. Additionally, 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n and 1 <= k <= 10^9.**
