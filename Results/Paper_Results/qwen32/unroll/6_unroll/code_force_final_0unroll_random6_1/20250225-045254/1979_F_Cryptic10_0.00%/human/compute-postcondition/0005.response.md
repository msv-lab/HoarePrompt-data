Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `d` within the range of 0 to `n-1`, where `n` is the number of vertices in a graph. It prints a query with the value of `d` and then reads two integers `v` and `u` from the input. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the integers `v` and `u`.**
