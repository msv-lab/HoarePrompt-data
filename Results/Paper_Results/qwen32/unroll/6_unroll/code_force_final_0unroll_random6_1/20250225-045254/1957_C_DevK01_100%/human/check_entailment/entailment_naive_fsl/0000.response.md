Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem requirements. Here are some issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Positions:**
   - The program reduces `n` by 2 if `a != b` and by 1 if `a == b`. However, this does not accurately reflect the number of remaining positions on the board where rooks can be placed without attacking each other. The reduction should consider the actual positions that become unavailable due to the placement of rooks.

2. **Incorrect Use of Dynamic Programming:**
   - The dynamic programming function `func_1` seems to be trying to calculate the number of configurations, but the transition formula `dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]` does not correctly represent the logic for calculating the number of valid configurations. The formula appears to be incorrect or incomplete.

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The modulo operation is applied with `(7 + 10 ** 9)` instead of `10 ** 9 + 7`. This is a minor issue but still incorrect.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases such as when `n` is very small (e.g., `n = 1`) or when `k` is equal to `n`.

5. **Function Call:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` is called without being defined in the context of the provided code snippet. This is a critical issue as the function is essential to the solution.

To ensure correctness, the program needs to accurately track the available positions on the board and correctly compute the number of valid configurations using appropriate logic and dynamic programming. The current implementation does not achieve this.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
For an input like:
```
1
3 1
1 2
```
The program would incorrectly calculate the number of configurations. The correct output should be `2`, but the program might output an incorrect value due to the issues mentioned above.
