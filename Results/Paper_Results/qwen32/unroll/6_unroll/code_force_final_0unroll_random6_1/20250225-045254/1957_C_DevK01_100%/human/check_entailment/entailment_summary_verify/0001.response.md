To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's carefully analyze the problem description, the code, and the function summary.

### Problem Description Recap

- **Objective:** Calculate the number of distinct final configurations of an `n x n` chessboard after placing rooks according to specific rules, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
- **Game Rules:**
  - Players take turns placing rooks.
  - Rooks cannot attack each other (i.e., no two rooks can be in the same row or column).
  - The player places white rooks, and the computer places black rooks.
  - The computer mirrors the player's move `(r, c)` to `(c, r)`, unless `r == c`, in which case it skips its turn.
- **Input:**
  - Number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, the size of the board `n` and the number of moves `k`.
  - The next `k` lines specify the moves `(r, c)` made by the player.
- **Output:**
  - For each test case, the number of distinct final configurations of the chessboard.

### Program Analysis

The program consists of the following steps:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `n` and `k`.
   - For each of the `k` moves, read `(r, c)`.

2. **Processing Moves:**
   - For each move `(r, c)`, check if `r == c`.
     - If `r != c`, decrement `n` by 2 (since both rows and columns are occupied).
     - If `r == c`, decrement `n` by 1 (since only one position is occupied).
   - After processing all moves, call `func_1(n)` to compute the number of configurations.

3. **Dynamic Programming (`func_1`):**
   - Initialize `dp` with `[1, 1]`.
   - Use the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]) % (10^9 + 7)` to compute the number of configurations for board sizes up to `n`.
   - Return `dp[-1]` as the result.

### Function Summary Recap

- `func_1(n)` computes the number of distinct final configurations for an `n x n` board using a dynamic programming approach based on the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]) % (10^9 + 7)`.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Move Processing:**
   - The logic for decrementing `n` based on whether `r == c` seems correct.
     - If `r != c`, both `r` and `c` are occupied, so `n` should be decremented by 2.
     - If `r == c`, only one position is occupied, so `n` should be decremented by 1.
   - This correctly reflects the rules of the game.

2. **Dynamic Programming Recurrence:**
   - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]) % (10^9 + 7)` is used to compute the number of configurations.
   - This relation is derived from considering the placement of rooks in a way that no two rooks attack each other, which is consistent with the problem's constraints.
   - The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 1` are correct, as there is only one way to place rooks on a 1x1 or 2x2 board without them attacking each other.

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The results are taken modulo `10^9 + 7` to handle large numbers, which is consistent with the problem's requirements.

### Potential Issues

1. **Efficiency:**
   - The program processes up to `3 * 10^5` moves in total, which is within the constraints.
   - The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` is efficient for the given constraints.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where `k = 0` correctly by initializing `dp` with `[1, 1]`.
   - The program handles cases where `r == c` correctly by decrementing `n` by 1.

### Conclusion

The program correctly processes the input, updates the board size based on the moves, and uses dynamic programming to compute the number of distinct final configurations. The recurrence relation and base cases are consistent with the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final: True**
