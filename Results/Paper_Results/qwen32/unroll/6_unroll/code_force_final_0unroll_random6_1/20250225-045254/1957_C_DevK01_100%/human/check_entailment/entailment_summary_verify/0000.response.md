Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Chessboard and Moves**: The board is an \( n \times n \) grid. Players place rooks in turns, with the computer mirroring the player's move unless the move is on the diagonal (i.e., \( r = c \)).

2. **Constraints**: The moves are guaranteed to be valid, and we need to determine the number of possible final configurations after \( k \) moves, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

3. **Dynamic Programming**: The problem likely requires a dynamic programming approach to count the number of valid configurations efficiently, considering the constraints.

### Provided Code Analysis

The provided code reads the input, processes the moves, and then calls `func_1(n)` to compute the number of configurations. Let's break down the code:

- **Input Processing**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \). It then processes each of the \( k \) moves.
  
- **Move Processing**: For each move, the program adjusts the value of \( n \) based on whether the move is on the diagonal or not:
  - If the move is not on the diagonal (\( a \neq b \)), it reduces \( n \) by 2 because both the row and column are blocked.
  - If the move is on the diagonal (\( a = b \)), it reduces \( n \) by 1 because only one position is blocked.

- **Dynamic Programming Function**: The function `func_1(n)` is supposed to compute the number of valid configurations for a remaining \( n \times n \) board using dynamic programming.

### Function Summary Analysis

The function summary states that `func_1(n)` uses a specific recursive formula to compute the number of configurations. The formula is:
\[ \text{dp}[i] = (\text{dp}[i-1] + 2 \times (i - 1) \times \text{dp}[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7) \]

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Positions**:
   - The program reduces \( n \) by 2 or 1 based on the move type. This logic is correct in terms of blocking rows and columns, but it doesn't directly translate to the number of configurations. The reduction in \( n \) is used correctly to determine the size of the remaining board.

2. **Dynamic Programming Formula**:
   - The formula used in `func_1(n)` seems to be derived from a combinatorial problem where each new rook placement affects the number of configurations. However, the formula's correctness needs to be verified against the problem's requirements.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The modulo operation is correctly applied as \( 10^9 + 7 \).

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases by reducing \( n \) appropriately, but the dynamic programming formula needs to handle all possible values of \( n \) correctly.

5. **Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` is defined and called correctly in the provided code snippet.

### Verification of the Dynamic Programming Formula

The dynamic programming formula used in `func_1(n)` is:
\[ \text{dp}[i] = (\text{dp}[i-1] + 2 \times (i - 1) \times \text{dp}[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7) \]

This formula suggests that the number of configurations for a board of size \( i \) is derived from the configurations of boards of size \( i-1 \) and \( i-2 \). This is consistent with the problem's requirements, as each new rook placement affects the number of configurations in a specific way.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided program correctly processes the moves and uses a dynamic programming approach to compute the number of configurations. The formula used in `func_1(n)` is consistent with the problem's requirements, and the program handles the modulo operation correctly.

Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is inaccurate. The program appears to be correct based on the provided logic and function summary.

Final: **True**
