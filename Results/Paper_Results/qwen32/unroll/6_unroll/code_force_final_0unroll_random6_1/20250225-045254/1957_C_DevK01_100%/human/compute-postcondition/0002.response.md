Let's analyze the loop and the state changes to determine the final output state.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. This represents the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n. The values `r_i` and `c_i` are not used in the provided loop, so they can be ignored for this analysis.
- `dp` is a list with two elements, both initialized to 1.

The loop provided is:
```python
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]
    dp.pop(0)
```

The loop iterates from `i = 2` to `i = n`. In each iteration, it calculates a new value based on the last two elements of the `dp` list, appends this new value to the end of `dp`, and then removes the first element of `dp`. This means `dp` will always contain exactly two elements after the loop completes.

Let's break down the steps:
1. Initially, `dp = [1, 1]`.
2. For `i = 2`, the new value is `(1 + 2 * 1 * 1) % (7 + 10^9) = 3`. So, `dp` becomes `[1, 3]`, and then the first element is popped, resulting in `dp = [3]`. However, the next element is added immediately, so `dp = [3, 3]`.
3. For `i = 3`, the new value is `(3 + 2 * 2 * 3) % (7 + 10^9) = 15`. So, `dp` becomes `[3, 15]`, and then the first element is popped, resulting in `dp = [15]`. However, the next element is added immediately, so `dp = [15, 15]`.
4. This process continues until `i = n`.

The final state of `dp` after the loop will be `[dp[-2], dp[-1]]` where `dp[-1]` is the last computed value and `dp[-2]` is the value before that.

So, the final `dp` list will always have two elements, and the second element will be the result of the last iteration of the loop.

Output State: **dp = [value_before_last, last_computed_value]**, where `value_before_last` and `last_computed_value` are the last two values computed in the loop.

However, since the problem asks for the final state in a specific format and the values of `r_i` and `c_i` are not used in the loop, we can simply state the final `dp` list after the loop completes.

Output State: **dp = [last_computed_value, last_computed_value]**, where `last_computed_value` is the final value computed in the loop.

Since the problem does not require the exact numerical value but rather the format, we can describe the final state as:

Output State: **dp = [dp[-2], dp[-1]]**

But to adhere strictly to the format requested:

Output State: **dp = [final_value_before_last, final_last_value]**
