You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

Example

Input

    4 1
    
    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6

    4 4

    222 333
    
    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:

1. **Game Mechanics:**
   - A player and a computer take turns placing rooks on an `n x n` chessboard.
   - The player places white rooks, and the computer places black rooks.
   - Rooks cannot be placed in the same row or column as another rook.
   - After `k` moves, the game continues until no more valid moves can be made.
   - The computer mirrors the player's move `(r, c)` to `(c, r)`, unless `r == c`, in which case it skips its turn.

2. **Objective:**
   - Calculate the number of distinct final configurations of the chessboard after the game ends, modulo `10^9 + 7`.

3. **Constraints:**
   - Multiple test cases.
   - `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`
   - `1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5`
   - `0 ≤ k ≤ n`
   - Sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `3 * 10^5`.

### Program Analysis:

The given program consists of two main parts:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the size of the board `n` and the number of moves `k` are read.
   - For each of the `k` moves, the coordinates `(r, c)` are read.

2. **Processing Moves:**
   - For each move `(r, c)`, the program checks if `r == c`.
     - If `r != c`, it decrements `n` by 2 (since both rows and columns are occupied).
     - If `r == c`, it decrements `n` by 1 (since only one position is occupied).
   - After processing all moves, it calls `func_1(n)` to compute the number of configurations.

3. **Computing Configurations (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to compute the number of configurations.
   - It initializes a list `dp` with two elements `[1, 1]`.
   - It iteratively computes the number of configurations for boards of increasing size up to `n`.
   - The recurrence relation used is `dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]) % (10^9 + 7)`.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Move Processing:**
   - The logic for decrementing `n` based on whether `r == c` is correct.
   - If `r != c`, both `r` and `c` are occupied, so `n` should be decremented by 2.
   - If `r == c`, only one position is occupied, so `n` should be decremented by 1.

2. **Dynamic Programming Recurrence:**
   - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]) % (10^9 + 7)` is used to compute the number of configurations.
   - This relation is derived from considering the placement of rooks in a way that no two rooks attack each other, which is consistent with the problem's constraints.
   - The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 1` are correct, as there is only one way to place rooks on a 1x1 or 2x2 board without them attacking each other.

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The results are taken modulo `10^9 + 7` to handle large numbers, which is consistent with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly processes the input, updates the board size based on the moves, and uses dynamic programming to compute the number of distinct final configurations. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
