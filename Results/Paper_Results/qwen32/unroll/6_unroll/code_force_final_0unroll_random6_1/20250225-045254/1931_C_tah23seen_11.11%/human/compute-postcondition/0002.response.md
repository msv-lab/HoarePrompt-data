To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the condition `i <= j`. Given the initial states:

- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( a_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq a_i \leq n \), and \( n \) is the length of the list `arr`.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is \( n - 1 \).

The loop will execute if `i <= j`. Since `i` is initialized to 0 and `j` is initialized to \( n - 1 \), the loop will execute as long as \( n \geq 1 \). If \( n \) is 0, then `j` would be -1, and the loop condition `i <= j` (0 <= -1) would be false, preventing the loop from executing.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be at least 1. No other adjustments are necessary since the initial values of `i` and `j` are already set in a way that satisfies the loop condition when `n` is at least 1.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( a_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq a_i \leq n \), and \( n \) is the length of the list `arr` with \( n \geq 1 \); `i` is 0; `j` is \( n - 1 \)**
