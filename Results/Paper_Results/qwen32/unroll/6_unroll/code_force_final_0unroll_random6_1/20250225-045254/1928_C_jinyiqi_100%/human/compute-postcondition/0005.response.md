Output State: **The program returns the concatenation of `output2` and `output1`, where `output2` contains the divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output1` contains the divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order.**

In simpler terms, the program returns a list of divisors of `x` sorted in ascending order.
