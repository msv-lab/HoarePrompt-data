### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the provided function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the number of possible values of `k` such that Vasya's position `n` and the number `x` he received during the settling fit the described pattern.
- The pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
- The settling exists if and only if `k > 1`.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Undefined Function**: The function `func_1` is indeed called but not defined in the provided code, which will result in a `NameError`. This is a critical issue.

2. **Logic for Calculating k**:
   - The program attempts to find divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x` and then checks if `(s + 2) / 2` is a valid `k`.
   - The logic seems to be based on the assumption that the period `2k - 2` and its divisors might help in determining `k`, but this is not directly aligned with the problem's requirements.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `x` is 1 or when the calculated `k` values do not fit the pattern correctly.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program converts `k` values to floats and uses a set to remove duplicates, which can lead to precision issues and incorrect results.

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` is supposed to return a list of divisors of `x`, sorted such that divisors greater than or equal to the square root of `x` appear first, followed by divisors less than the square root of `x` in reverse order.
- This function, if implemented correctly, can be useful in finding potential `k` values, but the overall logic of the program needs to be re-evaluated.

#### Correctness Assessment:
- The original assessment is correct in identifying several issues with the provided program.
- The program has an undefined function (`func_1`), flawed logic for calculating `k`, and potential issues with handling edge cases and output format.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the reasons mentioned in the original assessment. The program does not correctly solve the problem as described, and the logic for determining `k` values is flawed.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
