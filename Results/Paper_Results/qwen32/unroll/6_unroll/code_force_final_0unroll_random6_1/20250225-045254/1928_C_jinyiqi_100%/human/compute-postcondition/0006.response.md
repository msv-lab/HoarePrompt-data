Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a string that is the concatenation of two parts: the first part contains the divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`, and the second part contains the divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order.**
