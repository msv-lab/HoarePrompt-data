You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)

    #State: `x` and `n` remain unchanged; `output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`; `output2` contains the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`.
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1
    #The program returns the concatenation of `output2` and `output1`, where `output2` contains the divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output1` contains the divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find all possible values of `k` such that Vasya's position `n` and the number he received `x` during the settling are consistent with the described pattern.
   - The pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - We need to find all `k > 1` that satisfy the conditions.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.
   - It initializes an empty list `output` to store valid `k` values.
   - It checks two conditions related to `n` and `x`:
     - `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`
     - `(n - x) % 2 == 0`
   - For each condition that holds true, it calls `func_1` to find divisors of `n + x - 2` or `n - x`.
   - It then checks if `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` for each divisor `s`.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, `(s + 2) / 2` is added to the `output` list.
   - Finally, it removes duplicates from `output` and prints the length of the list.

3. **Checking the Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1(x)` returns all divisors of `x` in descending order.
   - It iterates from `1` to `sqrt(x)` and checks if `x % i == 0`.
   - If true, it adds `i` and `x // i` to the list of divisors.
   - It reverses the first list of divisors and concatenates it with the second list to ensure descending order.

4. **Verifying the Logic:**
   - The logic in the code seems to be attempting to find all `k` values that satisfy the conditions.
   - However, there are some issues:
     - The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code snippet, but it is referenced.
     - The formula `(s + 2) / 2` is used to derive `k`, but it should be an integer check.
     - The conditions `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` are not directly derived from the problem description and might be incorrect or incomplete.
     - The logic for checking valid `k` values might not cover all cases correctly.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the issues identified, particularly the undefined function and potential incorrect conditions, the program might not be correct as it stands.
   - The logic for deriving `k` from the divisors and the conditions for `n` and `x` need to be re-evaluated to ensure they align with the problem description.
