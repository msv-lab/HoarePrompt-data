The code reverses the list `output1`, which contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `n` remain unchanged; `output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, but in reverse order; `output2` contains the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`.

Output State: **`x` and `n` remain unchanged; `output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order; `output2` contains the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`.**
