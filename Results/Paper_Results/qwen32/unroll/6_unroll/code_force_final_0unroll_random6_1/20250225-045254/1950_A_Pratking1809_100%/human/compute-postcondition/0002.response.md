Output State: **t remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, the values of a, b, and c are not defined outside the loop as they are re-assigned in each iteration; q remains the same input integer. The output consists of 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' printed for each of the q iterations based on the conditions evaluated within the loop.**
