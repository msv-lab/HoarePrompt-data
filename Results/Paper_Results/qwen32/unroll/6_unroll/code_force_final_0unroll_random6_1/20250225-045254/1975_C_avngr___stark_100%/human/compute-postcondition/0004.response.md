Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, if `n` is 2, it outputs the minimum of the two integers. Otherwise, it finds and outputs the maximum median value of all contiguous subarrays of length 3 in the array `a`.**
