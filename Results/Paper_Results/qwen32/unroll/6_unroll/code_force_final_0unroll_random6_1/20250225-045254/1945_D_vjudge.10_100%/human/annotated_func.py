#State of the program right berfore the function call: pergunta is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4), a and b are lists of integers where each list contains n integers (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9), n is an integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and m is an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n). It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m):
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        
        x += min(a[i], b[i])
        
    #State: pergunta is the minimum value between its initial value and the calculated values during the loop when i < m, a and b remain the same, n remains the same, m remains the same, and x is the sum of the minimum values of a[i] and b[i] from i = n-1 to i = 0.
    print(pergunta)
    #This is printed: pergunta (where pergunta is the minimum value between its initial value and the values calculated during the loop when i < m)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` calculates and prints the minimum value between the initial value of `pergunta` and the sum of the minimum values of corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b` up to a certain point, considering the constraints provided by `n` and `m`. Specifically, it updates `pergunta` by comparing it with the sum of these minimum values for indices less than `m`.
