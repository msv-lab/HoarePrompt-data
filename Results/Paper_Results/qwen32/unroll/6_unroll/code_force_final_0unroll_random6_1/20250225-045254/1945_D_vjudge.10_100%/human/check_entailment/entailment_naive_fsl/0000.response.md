Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in line. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate this minimum cost, but it does not do so accurately.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates from the end of the queue to the beginning, and it attempts to calculate the minimum cost to move Kirill to a position less than `m`. However, the logic inside the loop is flawed.
   - The line `pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])` is intended to update the minimum cost to move Kirill to a position less than `m`. However, `x` is not correctly accumulating the cost of bribing people between `j` and `i`.
   - The line `x += min(a[i], b[i])` is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the cost of bribing people between `j` and `i`. Specifically, `x` should accumulate the cost of bribing all people between `j` and `i`, not just the minimum cost of bribing the `i-th` person.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where `m` is 1, meaning Kirill needs to be at the front of the queue. In such cases, the cost would be the sum of the minimum costs of bribing all people in front of him.
   - The code does not handle cases where `m` is equal to `n`, meaning Kirill can stay at the end of the queue without any cost.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to use a more sophisticated approach that considers the cost of bribing people between `j` and `i` and ensures that Kirill can move to a position less than `m` with the minimum cost.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import heapq

def min_cost_to_front(n, m, a, b):
    # Min-heap to store the minimum cost to bribe people
    min_heap = []
    total_cost = 0
    
    # Iterate from the end of the queue to the beginning
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m - 1:
            # If we need to move Kirill to a position less than m
            total_cost += heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        else:
            # Add the cost of bribing the current person to the heap
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, min(a[i], b[i]))
    
    return total_cost

numCasos = int(input())
for i in range(numCasos):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(min_cost_to_front(n, m, a, b))
```

This corrected version uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum costs of bribing people and ensures that Kirill can move to a position less than `m` with the minimum cost.
