Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of boxes, a string `s` of length `n` where each character indicates whether there is a cat in the corresponding box ('1' for a cat, '0' otherwise), and a string `f` of length `n` where each character indicates whether there should be a cat in the corresponding box ('1' for a cat, '0' otherwise). The function returns the number of boxes where the presence of a cat matches the desired state specified by `f`.**
