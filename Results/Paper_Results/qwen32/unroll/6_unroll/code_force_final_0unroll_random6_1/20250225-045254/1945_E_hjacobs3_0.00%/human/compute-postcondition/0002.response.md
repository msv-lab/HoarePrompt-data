To determine the state that allows the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to ensure that the condition `l <= r` is satisfied. Given the initial state:

- `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
- `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`).
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 1`.

The condition `l <= r` depends on the values of `l` and `r`. Since `l` is initialized to 0 and `r` is initialized to `n - 1`, the condition `l <= r` will always be true as long as `n` is at least 1. This is because `n` is the length of the array and is guaranteed to be at least 1.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time. The initial state already satisfies the condition `l <= r`.

State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`), `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`**
