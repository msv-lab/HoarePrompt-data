### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies an issue with the program's logic. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array optimally.
   - The optimal arrangement to maximize this beauty is to sort the array in non-decreasing order. This ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`.
   - It defines a function `func_1` to check if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, indicating the array is already sorted, the program incorrectly prints `0` as the beauty.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, the program sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The function `func_1` is used incorrectly. The program should always sort the array to maximize the beauty, regardless of whether it is already sorted or not.
   - Printing `0` when the array is already sorted is incorrect because the beauty is not necessarily `0` in such cases. The beauty is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, which needs to be calculated even if the array is already sorted.

4. **Corrected Approach:**
   - The program should always sort the array in non-decreasing order.
   - It should then calculate the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - The result should be printed for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the function `func_1` is used incorrectly and that the program should always sort the array to maximize the beauty. Therefore, the program is indeed incorrect as it stands.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
