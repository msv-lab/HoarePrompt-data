### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program incorrectly handles the computation of the maximum beauty of the array due to an unnecessary and flawed function `func_1`. Here is a detailed breakdown of the issues and the reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`:** 
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. 
   - If the array is sorted, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
   - The problem arises because the program prints `0` if `func_1` returns `True`, which is incorrect unless the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order and all elements are equal.

2. **Incorrect Behavior:**
   - Even if the array is not sorted in non-decreasing order, the program should still sort the array and compute the beauty. The `func_1` check is unnecessary and leads to incorrect results when the array is not sorted.

3. **Counterexample:**
   - For the input `1 3 2`, the sorted array is `1 2 3`, and the beauty is `2`. However, `func_1` returns `False`, and the program proceeds to sort the array and compute the beauty correctly. The issue arises when the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order but not necessarily in the optimal arrangement for maximum beauty.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - The program should always sort the array and compute the beauty without using `func_1`. Sorting the array ensures that the difference between consecutive elements is maximized.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is correct because the program incorrectly handles the computation of the maximum beauty due to the unnecessary and flawed `func_1` function. The program should always sort the array and compute the beauty.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
