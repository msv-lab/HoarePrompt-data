### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using the allowed operations. The logic in the function `func_1` seems to be attempting to count the number of inversions in the string, but it does not correctly account for the cost of cyclic shifts.

Let's re-evaluate the code with a detailed step-by-step analysis using the example `101011`:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `zeroes` is set to the count of `0`s in the string, which is `3`.
   - `cnt` is initialized to `[0, 0]` to keep track of the count of `0`s and `1`s encountered so far.
   - `ans` is initialized to `0` to accumulate the cost.

2. **Iteration through the string `101011`:**
   - **First character `1`:**
     - `cnt[1]` is incremented to `1`.
     - Since the character is `1`, `ans` is incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]`, which is `3 - 0 = 3`. So, `ans` becomes `3`.
   - **Second character `0`:**
     - `cnt[0]` is incremented to `1`.
     - Since the character is `0` and `cnt[1] > 0`, `ans` is incremented by `1`. So, `ans` becomes `4`.
   - **Third character `1`:**
     - `cnt[1]` is incremented to `2`.
     - Since the character is `1`, `ans` is incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]`, which is `3 - 1 = 2`. So, `ans` becomes `6`.
   - **Fourth character `0`:**
     - `cnt[0]` is incremented to `2`.
     - Since the character is `0` and `cnt[1] > 0`, `ans` is incremented by `1`. So, `ans` becomes `7`.
   - **Fifth character `1`:**
     - `cnt[1]` is incremented to `3`.
     - Since the character is `1`, `ans` is incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]`, which is `3 - 2 = 1`. So, `ans` becomes `8`.
   - **Sixth character `1`:**
     - `cnt[1]` is incremented to `4`.
     - Since the character is `1`, `ans` is incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]`, which is `3 - 2 = 1`. So, `ans` becomes `9`.

The final value of `ans` is `9`, which is not the correct minimum cost of `5`.

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for cyclic shifts to sort the string. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
