In the given for loop, the loop head only contains the variable `_` and `n`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate `n` times and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts. The variable `n` determines how many times the loop will execute.

To ensure that the loop can execute, `n` must be at least 1. The variable `t` and the binary string `s` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure that it is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and for each of the `t` test cases, there is a binary string `s` such that 2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5, and the sum of lengths of all strings `s` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
