Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, and for each of the `t` test cases, there is a binary string `s` such that 2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5, and the sum of lengths of all strings `s` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

In simple terms, `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10,000. A new variable `n` is assigned the value of an input integer. The conditions regarding the binary strings `s` for each test case remain unchanged.
