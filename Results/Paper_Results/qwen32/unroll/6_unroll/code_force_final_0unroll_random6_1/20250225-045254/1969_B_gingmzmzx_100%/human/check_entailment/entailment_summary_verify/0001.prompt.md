You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a binary string. For each binary string, it calculates and prints a value based on the number of 1s that appear after each 0 in the string. Specifically, for each 0 in the string, it counts how many 1s have appeared before it, and for each 1, it counts how many 0s have not yet appeared. The function outputs this calculated value for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the provided Python program is correct for the given problem, we need to analyze the logic and see if it correctly calculates the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using the specified cyclic shift operations.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to sort a binary string (a string consisting of '0's and '1's) in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's followed by all '1's) by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of a cyclic shift operation is the length of the substring being shifted. The goal is to find the minimum total cost to achieve the sorted string.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
2. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers.
3. It counts the total number of '0's in the string (`zeroes`).
4. It initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of '0's and '1's encountered so far and a variable `ans` to accumulate the total cost.
5. It iterates through the string `s`:
   - If the current character `c` is '0', it adds 1 to the total cost if there have been any '1's encountered so far (`cnt[1] > 0`).
   - If the current character `c` is '1', it adds the number of remaining '0's to the total cost (`zeroes - cnt[0]`).
6. Finally, it prints the accumulated cost for each test case.

### Correctness Check

Let's verify if this logic correctly computes the minimum cost:

- The key idea is that each '1' encountered after the first '0' requires a shift to bring it to the end of the string, and each '0' encountered after a '1' requires a shift to bring all preceding '1's to the beginning of the string.
- The program correctly counts the number of '1's encountered before each '0' and adds this count to the total cost.
- The program also correctly counts the number of '0's remaining after each '1' and adds this count to the total cost.
- This ensures that each '1' is moved to the end of the string and each '0' is moved to the beginning of the string with the minimum cost.

### Conclusion

The program's logic correctly calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the specified cyclic shift operations.
