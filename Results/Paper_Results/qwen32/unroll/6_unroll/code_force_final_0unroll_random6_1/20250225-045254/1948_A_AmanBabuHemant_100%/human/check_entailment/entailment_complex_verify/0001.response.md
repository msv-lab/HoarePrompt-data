Let's systematically analyze the provided Python program based on the problem description, the program code, and the annotated version of the code to evaluate its correctness.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Build a string** of uppercase Latin letters.
2. **Special characters** in the string must be exactly `n` in number.
3. **Special character definition**: A character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
4. **Output**:
   - If no such string exists, print "NO".
   - If such a string exists, print "YES" followed by the string itself (length should be at most 200).

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.

2. **Logic to Determine the String**:
   - If `n` is odd, the program prints "NO". This is because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where special characters are defined as being equal to exactly one of their neighbors. This reasoning is correct.
   - If `n` is even, the program constructs a string using the pattern "AAB" repeated `n // 2` times. This ensures that there are exactly `n` special characters in the string. Let's verify this:
     - In the pattern "AAB", the 'A's are special characters because each 'A' is equal to exactly one of its neighbors ('B').
     - The 'B's are not special characters because each 'B' is equal to both of its neighbors ('A').
     - Therefore, in "AAB", there are 2 special characters ('A' at positions 1 and 3).
     - Repeating "AAB" `n // 2` times will result in a string with exactly `n` special characters, as each repetition contributes 2 special characters.

3. **Checking the Length of the String**:
   - The program checks if the length of the constructed string is less than 200. If it is, it prints "YES" followed by the string.
   - If the length of the string is 200 or more, it prints "NO". However, given the pattern "AAB" and the constraint `n <= 50`, the maximum length of the string will be `3 * (50 // 2) = 75`, which is well within the limit of 200.

### Evaluation:
- The program correctly handles the case where `n` is odd by printing "NO".
- The program correctly constructs a string with exactly `n` special characters when `n` is even.
- The program ensures that the constructed string length is within the required limit.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: True**
