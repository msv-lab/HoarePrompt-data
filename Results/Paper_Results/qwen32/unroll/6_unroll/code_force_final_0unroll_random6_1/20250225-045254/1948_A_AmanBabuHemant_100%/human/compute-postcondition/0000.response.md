Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 50, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to be the integer input by the user, which is constrained to be between 1 and 50 inclusive. The initial state of `n` for each test case remains unchanged as it is not assigned a value in the given code snippet.
