### Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a string with exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The program provided attempts to solve this problem by generating a string of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times when `n` is even. Let's analyze this approach:

1. **Even `n` Case**:
   - The string 'AAB' has two special characters ('A' at the second position and 'B' at the third position).
   - When 'AAB' is repeated `n // 2` times, the resulting string will have `n` special characters, because each 'AAB' segment contributes exactly 2 special characters.
   - For example, if `n = 6`, the string 'AAB' repeated 3 times results in 'AAABAAB', which indeed has 6 special characters.

2. **Odd `n` Case**:
   - It is impossible to have an odd number of special characters with the pattern 'AAB'. Each 'AAB' segment contributes exactly 2 special characters, and an odd number of special characters cannot be formed by repeating a segment that always contributes an even number of special characters.
   - Therefore, the program correctly prints 'NO' for odd `n`.

3. **Length Constraint**:
   - The program checks if the length of the generated string is less than 200 characters. Since 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times results in a string of length `3 * (n // 2)`, and the maximum `n` is 50, the maximum length of the string is `3 * (50 // 2) = 75`, which is well within the limit of 200 characters.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles both even and odd cases and ensures that the generated string, if any, does not exceed the length limit. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
