**Reasoning:**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game as described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Loop Structure**: The loop iterates over the number of test cases `t`, but the logic to determine the winner is outside the loop. This means the program only checks the last test case and prints the result for all test cases, which is incorrect.

2. **Winning Condition**: The logic to determine the winner is based on the parity (even or odd) of the sum of `a` and `b`. However, this logic does not align with the optimal strategy for the game. The correct strategy involves analyzing the game states and determining the winner based on the initial number of coins in both wallets.

3. **Output**: The program prints "bob" with extra spaces, which does not match the expected output format.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should implement a strategy that considers the game dynamics. One correct approach is to realize that if the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by ensuring that she leaves an even sum for Bob after her turn. Conversely, if the sum is even, Bob can force Alice into a losing position.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b) % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')

func()
```

**Correctness: False**

The original program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner based on the game rules and test cases.
