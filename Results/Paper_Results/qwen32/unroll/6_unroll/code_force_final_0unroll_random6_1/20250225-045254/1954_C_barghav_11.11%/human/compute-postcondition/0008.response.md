Output State: **the output state you calculate.**

To determine the output state, we need to focus on the loop and its effect on the given variables. The loop iterates over the list `b` and prints each element without spaces. The variables `t`, `x`, `y`, and the sorting of lists `a` and `b` are not affected by the loop, so they remain unchanged.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(len(b)):
    print(b[i], end='')
```

The loop will print all elements of list `b` concatenated together without any spaces. Therefore, the output will be a single string formed by the elements of `b`.

Since the specific values of `b` are not provided, we can't provide the exact concatenated string, but we can describe the output state in terms of the list `b`.
