The function reads two integers `x` and `y` as input, where each integer consists only of digits from 1 to 9. It then rearranges the digits of each number such that the first half of the digits in each number are sorted in descending order and the second half are sorted in ascending order. The function outputs the rearranged numbers for each test case, one per line.
