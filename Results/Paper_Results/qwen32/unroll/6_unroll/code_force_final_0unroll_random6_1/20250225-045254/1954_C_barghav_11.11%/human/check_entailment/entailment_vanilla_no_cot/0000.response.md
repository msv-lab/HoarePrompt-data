Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly maximize the product of the two numbers `x` and `y`. The logic in the function `func_1` incorrectly attempts to maximize the product by swapping the first half of the digits in a way that does not necessarily lead to the maximum product. The swapping strategy should consider the overall effect on the product rather than just the first half of the digits.

A correct approach would be to compare each corresponding digit of `x` and `y` and swap them if it increases the product. This can be done by comparing the concatenated numbers formed by swapping each pair of digits. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if int(a[i]) < int(b[i]):
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
    print(''.join(a))
    print(''.join(b))
```

This version correctly swaps digits to maximize the product by ensuring that the larger digit is always in the more significant position in the resulting numbers.
