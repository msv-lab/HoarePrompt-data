You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, and for each of the t test cases, there is a string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings are distinct.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, for each of the `t` test cases, the variables `ac` and `bc` hold the count of 'A's and 'B's respectively in the string `s` of that test case. The variable `s` holds the last input string processed, and `q` holds the value `t-1`. The initial value of `t` and the distinct strings provided as input remain unchanged.
    if (ac > bc) :
        print('A')
        #This is printed: A
    else :
        print('B')
        #This is printed: B
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, for each of the `t` test cases, the variables `ac` and `bc` hold the count of 'A's and 'B's respectively in the string `s` of that test case. The variable `s` holds the last input string processed, and `q` holds the value `t-1`. The initial value of `t` and the distinct strings provided as input remain unchanged. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, then `ac` is greater than `bc`; otherwise, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided program has a logical error in its structure. The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates through each test case to count the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'. However, it incorrectly places the comparison and print statements outside the loop that processes each test case. As a result, the program compares the counts of 'A' and 'B' only after processing all test cases, and it prints the result only once, instead of printing the result for each test case.

To fix the program, the comparison and print statements should be placed inside the loop that processes each test case. This way, the program will compare the counts of 'A' and 'B' for each test case individually and print the result for each one.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')

func()
```

Correctness: **False**
