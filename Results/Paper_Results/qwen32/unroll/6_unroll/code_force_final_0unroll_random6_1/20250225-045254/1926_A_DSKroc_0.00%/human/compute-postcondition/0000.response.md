The value of `t` is reassigned to the integer value obtained from `input()`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32 remains valid, but the specific value of `t` is now the user input. The information about the test cases and the strings of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B' remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 32, and for each of the `t` test cases, there is a string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. All `t` strings are distinct.**
