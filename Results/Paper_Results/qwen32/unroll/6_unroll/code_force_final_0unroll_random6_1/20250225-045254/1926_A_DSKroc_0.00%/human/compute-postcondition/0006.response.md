The task requires us to determine what will be printed when the `print('B')` statement is executed, given the initial state described.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `ac` and `bc` hold the counts of 'A's and 'B's respectively in the string `s`.
- `s` holds the last input string processed.
- `q` holds the value `t-1`.
- `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`.

### Analysis:
The `print('B')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `ac`, `bc`, `s`, `t`, or `q`. The statement simply prints the character 'B'.

### Conclusion:
Since the `print('B')` statement does not use any variables or conditions that change its output based on the initial state, the output will always be 'B'.

### Final Output:
Output: **B**
