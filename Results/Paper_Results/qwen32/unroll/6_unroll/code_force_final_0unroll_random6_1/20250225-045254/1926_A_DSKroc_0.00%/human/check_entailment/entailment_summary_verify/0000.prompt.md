You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
    if ac > bc:
        print('A')
    else:
        print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of a distinct string of length 5 containing only 'A' and 'B'. For each test case, the function counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string and prints 'A' if there are more 'A's than 'B's, otherwise it prints 'B'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the issue lies in the placement of the final `if` statement that determines which character appears most frequently. This `if` statement is currently outside of the loop that processes each test case, meaning it only compares the counts from the last test case and prints the result once, instead of printing the result for each test case.

Here's the problematic part of the code:
```python
for q in range(t):
    ac = 0
    bc = 0
    s = input()
    for i in s:
        if i == 'A':
            ac += 1
        else:
            bc += 1
if ac > bc:
    print('A')
else:
    print('B')
```

To fix this, the final `if` statement should be inside the loop so that it processes and prints the result for each test case individually. Here is the corrected version of the code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
```

With this correction, the program will correctly output the most frequent character for each test case.
