Given the initial state, we have the following information:
- `ac` and `bc` are the counts of 'A's and 'B's in the string `s` for the last test case processed.
- `s` holds the last input string processed.
- `q` holds the value `t-1`, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- `ac` is greater than `bc`.

The `print` statement in question is:
```python
print('A')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on the values of `ac`, `bc`, `s`, or any other variables. It directly prints the character 'A'.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the character 'A'.

Output: **A**
