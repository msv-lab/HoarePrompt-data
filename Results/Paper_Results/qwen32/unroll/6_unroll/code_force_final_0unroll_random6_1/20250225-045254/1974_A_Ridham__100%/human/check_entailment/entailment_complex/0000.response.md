### Reasoning:
To determine if the program is correct, we need to verify if the logic for calculating the minimum number of screens required for each test case is accurate. The key steps in the program are:

1. **Calculate the space required for 1x1 and 2x2 icons:**
   - `space_x = x * 1` (since each 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell)
   - `space_y = y * 4` (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells)

2. **Determine the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons:**
   - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y = y // 2` (each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, so two 2x2 icons can fit in one screen).
   - If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1` (an extra screen is needed for the remaining 2x2 icon).

3. **Calculate the remaining cells on the screens used for 2x2 icons:**
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y` (since each screen has 15 cells, and `space_y` cells are occupied by 2x2 icons).

4. **Determine if the remaining cells are sufficient for the 1x1 icons:**
   - If `space_x <= remaining_cells`, all 1x1 icons can fit on the screens used for 2x2 icons.
   - If `space_x > remaining_cells`, additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons:
     - `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells` (the number of additional cells required for 1x1 icons).
     - `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + (1 if extra_space % 15 != 0 else 0)` (calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons).

5. **Calculate the total number of screens required:**
   - If no additional screens are needed for 1x1 icons, the total number of screens is `screen_require_for_y`.
   - If additional screens are needed for 1x1 icons, the total number of screens is `screen_require_for_y + extra_screen`.

### Verification with the Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **First test case (x=1, y=1):**
  - `screen_require_for_y = 1 // 2 + 1 = 1`
  - `remaining_cells = 15 * 1 - 4 = 11`
  - Since `space_x = 1 <= 11`, only 1 screen is required.
  - Output: `1`

- **Third test case (x=12, y=4):**
  - `screen_require_for_y = 4 // 2 = 2`
  - `remaining_cells = 15 * 2 - 16 = 14`
  - Since `space_x = 12 <= 14`, only 2 screens are required.
  - Output: `2`

- **Tenth test case (x=8, y=2):**
  - `screen_require_for_y = 2 // 2 = 1`
  - `remaining_cells = 15 * 1 - 8 = 7`
  - Since `space_x = 8 > 7`, additional screens are needed.
  - `extra_space = 8 - 7 = 1`
  - `extra_screen = 1 // 15 + (1 if 1 % 15 != 0 else 0) = 1`
  - Total screens required: `1 + 1 = 2`
  - Output: `2`

- **Eleventh test case (x=0, y=9):**
  - `screen_require_for_y = 9 // 2 + 1 = 5`
  - `remaining_cells = 15 * 5 - 36 = 39`
  - Since `space_x = 0 <= 39`, only 5 screens are required.
  - Output: `5`

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for each test case.
