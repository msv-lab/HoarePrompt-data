To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all iterations, let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases (1 <= t <= 10^4)
   - `n`: Number of iterations for each test case (input integer)
   - `result`: An empty list that will store the results of each iteration

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each of the `n` iterations, the following steps are performed:
     - Read two integers `x` and `y` from the input.
     - Calculate `space_x` which is simply `x * 1` (i.e., `x`).
     - Calculate `space_y` which is `y * 4`.
     - Calculate `total_space` which is `space_y + space_x`.
     - Determine `screen_require_for_y`:
       - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`.
       - If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`.
     - Calculate `remaining_cells` which is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
     - Check if `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`:
       - If true, append `screen_require_for_y` to `result`.
       - If false, calculate `extra_space` which is `space_x - remaining_cells`.
         - Determine `extra_screen`:
           - If `extra_space` is divisible by 15, `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15`.
           - If `extra_space` is not divisible by 15, `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15 + 1`.
         - Append `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` to `result`.

3. **Output State:**
   - After all iterations, the `result` list will contain the results for each iteration of the loop for the current test case.
   - The value of `t` and `n` will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
   - The `result` list will be populated with integers based on the logic described above.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, and `result` is a list containing the results of each iteration for the current test case.**
