The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `result`. The values of `t`, `n`, and the pairs of integers `x` and `y` for each test case remain unchanged by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is simply that `result` is now an empty list, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, and for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `result` is an empty list.**
