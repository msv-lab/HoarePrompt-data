Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in the loop where it calculates `sum_total` and `sum_values[i]`. Specifically, the loop runs up to `n + 1`, but `n` is not defined in that scope; it should be `max(numbers) + 1` to ensure it covers all numbers up to the largest `n` in the input. However, there's an even more critical issue.

The program incorrectly calculates `sum_total` by using `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]` which is not the correct way to accumulate the sum of digit sums up to `i`. Instead, it should be accumulating the values correctly by summing up the digit sums from 1 to `i`.

Here's a corrected version of the problematic part of the code:

```python
for i in range(10, max(numbers) + 1):
    word = str(i)
    last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
    remainder = int(word[:-1])
    values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
    sum_values[i] = sum_values[i - 1] + values[i]
```

The original code incorrectly calculates the cumulative sum, leading to incorrect results for larger values of `n`. For example, for `n=2024`, the original program would not produce the correct output `4600002`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
