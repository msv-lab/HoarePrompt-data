The only variable in the loop head is `n`, which is iterated over the `numbers` list. For the loop to execute, the `numbers` list must have at least one element. The state of `t`, `values`, `sum_values`, and `total` does not affect whether the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head.

Thus, to ensure the loop executes, the `numbers` list must contain at least one integer.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); `numbers` is a list containing at least one integer, each corresponding to the input integer provided in each iteration of the loop; `values` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 2]; `sum_values` is [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 46, 48, 51, 55, 60, 66, 73, 81, 90, 100, 102]; `total` is 45**
