The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `total`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `numbers`, `values`, or `sum_values`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each corresponding to the input integer provided in each iteration of the loop; `values` is a list of zeros with length `max(numbers) + 1`; `sum_values` is a list of zeros with length `max(numbers) + 1`; `total` is 0.**
