The input to the function `bin_search` does not align with the problem description provided. The problem involves multiple test cases with slimes and their sizes, and the function should handle these inputs accordingly. However, based on the problem description, the precondition for the inputs would be: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test case consists of an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, and a list `a` of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
