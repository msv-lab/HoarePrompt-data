Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime, or reporting that it is impossible. The program uses two main functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to achieve this.

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the position of a given size `x` in the list `a`. If `x` is not found, it returns the index where `x` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order. It handles the case where `x` is less than 0 by returning -1.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function calculates the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten. It does so by:
   - Maintaining a `left` list that contains prefix sums of the slime sizes.
   - Maintaining a `last` list that keeps track of the last index where the slime size changed.
   - Iterating through the list of slime sizes. For each slime, if it is smaller than the previous one, it can be eaten immediately (1 second). Otherwise, it calculates the position in the `left` list where the slime could have been eaten and updates the answer accordingly.

The main part of the program processes each test case by calling `func_2` twice: once for the original list and once for the reversed list. It then combines the results to ensure that the minimum number of seconds is correctly calculated for each slime.

The provided example inputs and outputs are consistent with the program's logic. The program correctly identifies the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten or reports -1 if it is impossible.

Correctness: **True**
