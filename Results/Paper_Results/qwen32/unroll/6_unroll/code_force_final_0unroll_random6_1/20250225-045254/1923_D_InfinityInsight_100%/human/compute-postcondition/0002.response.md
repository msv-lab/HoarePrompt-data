The code snippet initializes a list `ans` with `n` elements, all set to `-1`. The other variables `a`, `n`, `left`, and `last` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that 1 <= n <= len(a), `left` is a list containing the integer 0, `last` is a list containing the integer -1, `ans` is a list of `n` integers, all set to -1.**
