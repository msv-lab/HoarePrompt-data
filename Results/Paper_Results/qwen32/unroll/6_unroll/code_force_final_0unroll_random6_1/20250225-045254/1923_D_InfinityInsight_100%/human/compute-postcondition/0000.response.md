The code snippet initializes a new list named `left` with a single element, `0`. The initial state of `a` (a list of integers) and `n` (an integer representing the number of slimes) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that 1 <= n <= len(a), `left` is a list containing the integer 0.**
