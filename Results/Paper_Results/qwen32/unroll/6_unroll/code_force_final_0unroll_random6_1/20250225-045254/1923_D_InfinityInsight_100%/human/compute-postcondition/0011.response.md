Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of integers representing the sizes of slimes and an integer `n` representing the number of slimes such that 1 <= n <= len(a). It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element is determined based on the sizes of the slimes and their relative positions. The specific values in the returned list are calculated through a series of operations involving prefix sums and indices of changes in slime sizes.**
