### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the code and the problem description to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**:
   - Multiple test cases.
   - Each test case starts with an integer `n`, indicating that there are `2n` integers on the whiteboard.
   - The next line contains `2n` integers.

2. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output the maximum final score achievable by performing the described moves `n` times.

3. **Strategy**:
   - To maximize the score, the optimal strategy is to always pair the smallest available numbers together. This is because adding the minimum of each pair directly maximizes the score.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and then reads `2n` integers from the input.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, which will hold the final score.
   - It then attempts to process the list of integers in a loop.
   - The loop is intended to iterate `n` times, each time selecting the smallest two integers, adding the smaller one to `ans`, and removing both from the list.

3. **Critical Issues**:
   - **Incorrect Loop Condition**: The loop condition `for i in range(n * 2)` is incorrect. It should iterate `n` times, not `2n` times.
   - **Incorrect Removal of Elements**: The lines `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` are incorrect. The `* 2` is unnecessary and will always remove the first two elements, not the smallest ones.
   - **Sorting**: The code does not sort the list of integers, which is necessary to always pick the smallest available numbers.
   - **Handling of List Length**: The condition `if len(lst) != 2` is incorrect and unnecessary. The loop should simply iterate `n` times after sorting the list.
   - **Termination**: The `else` block is not needed since the loop will naturally terminate after `n` iterations.

#### Corrected Approach:
1. **Sort the List**: Sort the list of integers in ascending order.
2. **Iterate n Times**: Iterate `n` times, each time adding the first element (smallest) of the list to `ans` and then removing the first two elements.
3. **Output the Result**: After processing all test cases, output the results.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not implement the correct strategy to solve the problem. It does not sort the list, incorrectly removes elements, and has a flawed loop condition. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
