You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = l.split(' ')
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives multiple test cases. For each test case, it is given an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing half the number of integers on the whiteboard, and a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) representing the numbers written on the whiteboard. The number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) is provided at the start.

    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        
        n = int(input())
        
        l = input()
        
        lst = l.split(' ')
        
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break
        
        ans_f.append(ans)
        
    #State: `ans_f` is a list containing the results of each test case, where each result is the sum of the minimum values of the pairs formed from the input list for that test case.
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
        
    #State: `ans_f` is a list containing the results of each test case, where each result is the sum of the minimum values of the pairs formed from the input list for that test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the minimum values of `n` pairs formed from the list and prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum final score by optimally performing the n moves. There are several issues in the code:

1. **Incorrect Removal of Elements**:
   - The code attempts to remove elements from the list `lst` using `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])`. This is incorrect because `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` will always be `0` and `2` respectively, and the code will not correctly remove the first two elements in subsequent iterations.
   - The correct way to remove the first two elements would be `lst.pop(0)` and `lst.pop(0)`.

2. **Handling of List Length**:
   - The condition `if len(lst) != 2:` is incorrect. The loop should always pick the first two elements and remove them until the list is empty.

3. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n * 2):` is incorrect because it tries to iterate `2n` times, but the list is being modified by removing elements in each iteration, so the loop should run `n` times instead.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lst.sort()  # Sort the list to always pick the smallest elements first
        for _ in range(n):
            ans += lst.pop(0)  # Add the smallest element to the score and remove it
            lst.pop(0)  # Remove the next smallest element
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)

# Example input handling
# func()
```

In the corrected version:
- The list `lst` is sorted so that the smallest elements are always at the beginning.
- The loop runs `n` times, and in each iteration, the two smallest elements are added to the score and removed from the list.
- This ensures that the score is maximized by always adding the smallest possible values to the score.
