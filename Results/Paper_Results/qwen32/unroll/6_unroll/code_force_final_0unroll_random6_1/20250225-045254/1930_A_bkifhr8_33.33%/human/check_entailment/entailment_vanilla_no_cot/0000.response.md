Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Removal of Elements**: The removal of elements from the list `lst` is incorrect. The indices used in `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` are incorrect and will always remove the first two elements, not the elements at the correct indices.

2. **Logic for Summing Minimums**: The logic for summing the minimums of pairs is flawed. The program should sort the list and then sum every second element starting from the first. This ensures that the smallest elements are paired together, maximizing the sum of the minimums.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition `if len(lst) != 2` is incorrect. The loop should continue until all elements are processed, not until only two elements remain.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lst.sort()
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            ans += lst[i]
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)

func()
```

In this corrected version, the list is sorted, and then every second element starting from the first is added to the score, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the score.
