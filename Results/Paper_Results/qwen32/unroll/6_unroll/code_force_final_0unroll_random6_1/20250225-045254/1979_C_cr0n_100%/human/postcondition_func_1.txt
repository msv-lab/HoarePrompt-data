The function `func_2` reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `vals` from the user input. It calculates a value `den` as the product of all elements in `vals`, then computes a list `vprod` where each element is `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`. It adjusts `den` by subtracting the sum of `vprod`. If the adjusted `den` is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string. The function returns `None`.
