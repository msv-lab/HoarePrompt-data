The code snippet creates a new list `vprod` where each element is the result of dividing `den` by the corresponding element in `vals`. This operation does not change the values of `N`, `vals`, or `den`; it only introduces a new list `vprod`.

Output State: **`N` is the integer value input by the user, `vals` is a list of integers, `den` is the product of all elements in `vals`, `vprod` is a list where each element is `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.**
