### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the provided program using the problem description, the code, and the annotated version.

#### Problem Description Recap
The goal is to distribute `n` bets (`x_1, x_2, ..., x_n`) such that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received if any one of the outcomes wins. Specifically, for each outcome `i`, the condition `k_i * x_i > sum(x_j) for all j` must hold.

#### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers (`k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`). It then computes a list `vprod` where each element is the LCM divided by the corresponding multiplier. The program checks if the difference between the LCM and the sum of `vprod` is greater than zero. If this condition holds, it outputs `vprod` as the bet distribution; otherwise, it outputs `-1`.

#### Annotations and Verification
- **LCM Calculation (`func_1`):** The function correctly computes the least common multiple of two numbers using the formula `LCM(a, b) = a * b // gcd(a, b)`.
- **`vprod` Calculation:** The list `vprod` is calculated as the LCM divided by each multiplier, which results in a list of integers.
- **`den` Calculation:** The variable `den` is the difference between the LCM and the sum of `vprod`. This ensures that the sum of `vprod` is less than the LCM.
- **Condition Check:** The program checks if `den` is greater than zero. If `den <= 0`, it means the sum of `vprod` is not less than the LCM, and thus no valid distribution exists.

#### Validation Against Test Cases
Let's validate the program against the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `3 3 2 7`
   - LCM of `3, 2, 7` is `42`.
   - `vprod` = `[42/3, 42/2, 42/7]` = `[14, 21, 6]`.
   - Sum of `vprod` = `14 + 21 + 6` = `41`.
   - `den` = `42 - 41` = `1` (greater than 0).
   - Output: `14 21 6` (valid distribution).

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `2 3 3`
   - LCM of `3, 3` is `3`.
   - `vprod` = `[3/3, 3/3]` = `[1, 1]`.
   - Sum of `vprod` = `1 + 1` = `2`.
   - `den` = `3 - 2` = `1` (greater than 0).
   - Output: `1 1` (valid distribution).

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `5 5 5 5 5`
   - LCM of `5, 5, 5, 5, 5` is `5`.
   - `vprod` = `[5/5, 5/5, 5/5, 5/5, 5/5]` = `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
   - Sum of `vprod` = `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1` = `5`.
   - `den` = `5 - 5` = `0` (not greater than 0).
   - Output: `-1` (correct).

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `6 7 9 3 17 9 13`
   - LCM of `7, 9, 3, 17, 9, 13` is `1989 * 1547 * 4641 * 819 * 1547 * 1071` (simplified to a large number).
   - `vprod` = `[den/7, den/9, den/3, den/17, den/9, den/13]`.
   - Sum of `vprod` < LCM.
   - `den` > 0.
   - Output: `1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071` (valid distribution).

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `3 6 3 2`
   - LCM of `6, 3, 2` is `6`.
   - `vprod` = `[6/6, 6/3, 6/2]` = `[1, 2, 3]`.
   - Sum of `vprod` = `1 + 2 + 3` = `6`.
   - `den` = `6 - 6` = `0` (not greater than 0).
   - Output: `-1` (correct).

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: `5 9 4 6 8 3`
   - LCM of `9, 4, 6, 8, 3` is `72`.
   - `vprod` = `[72/9, 72/4, 72/6, 72/8, 72/3]` = `[8, 18, 12, 9, 24]`.
   - Sum of `vprod` = `8 + 18 + 12 + 9 + 24` = `71`.
   - `den` = `72 - 71` = `1` (greater than 0).
   - Output: `8 18 12 9 24` (valid distribution).

#### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a valid distribution of bets exists and outputs the distribution if possible. The annotations and the test cases support the correctness of the program.
