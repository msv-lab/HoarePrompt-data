Reasoning:  
The program's logic is based on the observation that the robot needs to reach the cell (2, n) from the starting position (1, 1). The robot's movement involves two steps for each second: a move in one of the four cardinal directions (left, right, down, up) and then following the arrow in the cell it lands on. 

Given the constraints and the nature of the grid, the critical point to consider is the second last cell of the second row, i.e., `b[n-2]`. If the arrow in this cell points to the left (`<`), the robot will be unable to move to the final cell (2, n) because it would move back to the first row or stay within the second row but not reach the last column. Conversely, if the arrow points to the right (`>`), the robot can proceed to the final cell (2, n).

The program correctly implements this logic by checking the direction of the arrow in the second last cell of the second row. If it points left, it prints "No", indicating that the robot cannot reach the target cell. If it points right, it prints "Yes", indicating that the robot can reach the target cell.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
