The code snippet initializes a list `v` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `p`. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `p_i` <= n, `p_i` != i for all i in [1, n]; `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0.**
