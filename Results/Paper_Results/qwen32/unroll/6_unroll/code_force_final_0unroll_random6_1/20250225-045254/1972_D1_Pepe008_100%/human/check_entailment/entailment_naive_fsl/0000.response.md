To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to carefully analyze the logic and ensure it aligns with the problem description for all possible inputs within the given constraints. Let's break down the problem and the provided solution:

### Problem Description
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Provided Program
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)
```

### Analysis
Let's analyze the logic of the provided program step-by-step:

1. **Loop through each test case**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
2. **Loop through each possible value of \(b\)**: For each test case, it loops through all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
3. **Calculate \(x\)**: For each \(b\), it calculates \(x = \left(\frac{a - i(i-1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\).
4. **Check if \(x\) is positive**: If \(x\) is positive, it adds \(x\) to the sum.
5. **Check additional condition**: If \((a - i(i-1)) \mod i^2 = 0\) and \(i(i-1) \mod i^2 = 0\), it adds 1 more to the sum.
6. **Print the result**: Finally, it prints the sum minus 2.

### Issues and Edge Cases
1. **Incorrect Loop Variable**: The loop variable `i` is used in the calculation of `x`, but it should be `b` instead.
2. **Incorrect Conditions**: The conditions to add 1 more to the sum are incorrect and do not align with the problem description.
3. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**: The sum calculation does not correctly count the valid pairs \((a, b)\).

### Correctness
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation
The program incorrectly uses `i` instead of `b` in the calculation of `x`. Additionally, the conditions to add 1 more to the sum are incorrect and do not align with the problem description. The sum calculation does not correctly count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To fix the program, the logic needs to be revised to correctly count the valid pairs based on the problem description.
