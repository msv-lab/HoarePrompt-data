Let's systematically analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate or not.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Given Program Analysis:
Here's the provided program:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)
```

### Annotations:
The annotations describe the program's state at key points:
```python
import math

# State of the program right before the function call: Each test case consists of two positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6). The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of n and the sum of m across all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^6.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        
        a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
        
        suma = 0
        
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        
        print(suma - 2)
        
    # State: a series of integers, each representing the result of `suma - 2` for each test case.
```

### Issues Identified in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Variable Names**: The program uses `a` and `b` to read the input values for `n` and `m` respectively, which is confusing and incorrect. The loop variable `i` should be used for `b` in the loop, and `a` should be used for `n`.
2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic inside the loop does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The expression `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` and the subsequent conditions do not accurately check the required condition.
3. **Incorrect Output Adjustment**: The final output is adjusted by subtracting 2 (`suma - 2`), which does not logically follow from the given conditions.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds true.

### Correct Program:
Here's a corrected version of the program:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

### Validation Using Annotations:
The annotations describe the program's state but do not provide evidence that the logic for calculating the number of valid pairs is correct. The annotations only describe the state of the program at key points without validating the correctness of the logic used to compute the result.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. The logic inside the loop does not correctly implement the required condition, and the output adjustment is not justified.

Final: **False**
