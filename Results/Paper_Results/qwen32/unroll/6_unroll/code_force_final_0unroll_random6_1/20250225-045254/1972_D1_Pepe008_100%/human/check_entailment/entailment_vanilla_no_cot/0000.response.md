Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for counting the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions is flawed. Specifically, the formula used to calculate the number of valid pairs is incorrect and does not properly account for the condition that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To correctly solve the problem, a different approach is needed. Here's a correct implementation outline:

1. Iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
2. For each \(b\), iterate over all possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

This implementation correctly checks each pair \((a, b)\) and counts those that satisfy the given condition. However, this approach may be inefficient for large values of \(n\) and \(m\). For an optimized solution, further mathematical insights or optimizations would be necessary.
