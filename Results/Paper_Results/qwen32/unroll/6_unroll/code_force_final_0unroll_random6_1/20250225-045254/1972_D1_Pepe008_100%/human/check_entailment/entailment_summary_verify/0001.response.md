### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its behavior based on the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Given Program Analysis:
Here's the given program:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)
```

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Variable Names**: The program uses `a` and `b` to read the input values for `n` and `m` respectively, which is confusing and incorrect.
2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic inside the loop does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The expression `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` and the subsequent conditions do not accurately check the required condition.
3. **Incorrect Output Adjustment**: The final output is adjusted by subtracting 2 (`suma - 2`), which does not logically follow from the given conditions.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary states that the function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates a specific sum based on these integers and prints the result minus two. However, the logic described in the summary does not align with the problem statement or the provided code.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds true.

#### Correct Program:
Here's a corrected version of the program:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. The logic inside the loop does not correctly implement the required condition, and the output adjustment is not logically valid.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described.
