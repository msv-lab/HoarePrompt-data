### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem description to determine if the program correctly implements the required logic.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Provided Program Recap:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)
```

#### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Loop through each test case**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
2. **Loop through each possible value of \(b\)**: For each test case, it loops through all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
3. **Calculate \(x\)**: For each \(b\), it calculates \(x = \left(\frac{a - i(i-1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\).
4. **Check if \(x\) is positive**: If \(x\) is positive, it adds \(x\) to the sum.
5. **Check additional condition**: If \((a - i(i-1)) \mod i^2 = 0\) and \(i(i-1) \mod i^2 = 0\), it adds 1 more to the sum.
6. **Print the result**: Finally, it prints the sum minus 2.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Loop Variable**: The loop variable `i` is used in the calculation of `x`, but it should be `b` instead.
2. **Incorrect Conditions**: The conditions to add 1 more to the sum are incorrect and do not align with the problem description.
3. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**: The sum calculation does not correctly count the valid pairs \((a, b)\).

#### Correct Logic:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Loop through each possible value of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
2. For each \(b\), loop through each possible value of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of valid pairs.

#### Revised Program:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (n, m) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        count = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

Given the original program's issues and the correct logic, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
