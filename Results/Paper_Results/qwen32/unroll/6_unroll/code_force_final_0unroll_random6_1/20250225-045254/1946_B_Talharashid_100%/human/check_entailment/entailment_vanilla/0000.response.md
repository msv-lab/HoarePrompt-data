Let's break down the problem and the given solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Recap:
- We start with an array `a` of `n` integers.
- We can perform exactly `k` operations. In each operation, we select any contiguous subarray of `a` (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array.
- The goal is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Key Observations:
- The optimal strategy is to repeatedly add the maximum positive contiguous subarray sum (`maxi`) to the array. This is because adding a positive sum increases the total sum, and adding it multiple times (up to `k` times) maximizes the total sum.
- If the maximum contiguous subarray sum is negative or zero, it's better to add zero (i.e., an empty subarray) because adding a negative sum would decrease the total sum.

### Correctness Analysis:
The provided code attempts to find the maximum contiguous subarray sum (`maxi`) and then calculates the final result as `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`. However, this formula does not correctly compute the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.

#### Issues with the Code:
1. **Incorrect Formula**: The formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l))` does not correctly represent the process of adding the maximum subarray sum `k` times.
2. **Handling of Negative and Zero Sums**: If `maxi` is zero or negative, the formula does not correctly handle the scenario where adding zero (an empty subarray) is optimal.
3. **Modulo Operation**: The code correctly applies the modulo operation, but it does not correctly compute the sum.

#### Correct Approach:
- Compute the maximum contiguous subarray sum (`maxi`) using Kadane's algorithm.
- If `maxi` is positive, the final sum is `sum(l) + k * maxi` because we can add `maxi` exactly `k` times to maximize the sum.
- If `maxi` is zero or negative, the final sum is simply `sum(l)` because adding zero (an empty subarray) `k` times does not change the sum.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Compute the maximum contiguous subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm
        maxi = float('-inf')
        current_sum = 0
        for ele in l:
            current_sum = max(ele, current_sum + ele)
            maxi = max(maxi, current_sum)
        
        # Compute the final sum
        if maxi > 0:
            final_sum = (sum(l) + k * maxi) % MOD
        else:
            final_sum = sum(l) % MOD
        
        print(final_sum)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original code does not correctly compute the maximum possible sum after `k` operations. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
