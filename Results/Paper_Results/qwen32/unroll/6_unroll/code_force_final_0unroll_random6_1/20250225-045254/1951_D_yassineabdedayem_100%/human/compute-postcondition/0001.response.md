To ensure that the for loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will execute `t` times. The variable `t` is the only one that can be adjusted in the loop head to ensure the loop executes.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.
3. The variables `n` and `k` are mentioned in the problem statement but are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `k` are still two positive integers (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}) for each test case**
