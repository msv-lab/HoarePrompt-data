Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`. For each test case, it prints a result based on specific conditions: if `B * 2` is less than `C`, it prints `A * B`; if `A` is even, it prints half of `A` multiplied by `C`; otherwise, it prints `A` divided by 2 (integer division), followed by the result of `X * C + B` where `X` is `A` divided by 2.**
