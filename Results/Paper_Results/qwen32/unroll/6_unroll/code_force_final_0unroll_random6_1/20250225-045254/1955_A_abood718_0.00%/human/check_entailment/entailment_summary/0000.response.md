Reasoning:
The given program is intended to calculate the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts based on the provided prices `a` (price for one yogurt) and `b` (price for two yogurts under promotion). Let's analyze the logic of the program:

1. **Condition `if B * 2 < C`**: 
   - This checks if buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than buying them under promotion. If true, the program correctly calculates the total cost by multiplying the number of yogurts `A` by the individual price `B`.

2. **Condition `elif A % 2 == 0`**:
   - This checks if the number of yogurts `A` is even. If true, the program correctly calculates the total cost by multiplying half of `A` by the promotion price `C`.

3. **Else Condition**:
   - If the number of yogurts `A` is odd, the program calculates the total cost by buying `X` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price `C` and one yogurt individually at the price `B`. Here, `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2.

However, there is a flaw in the else condition. The program prints `X` on a separate line, which is not part of the expected output format. It should directly print the calculated cost `X * C + B`.

Given the execution summary, it appears that the program is printing `X` on a separate line in the else condition, which is incorrect based on the problem's output requirements.

Correctness: **False**
