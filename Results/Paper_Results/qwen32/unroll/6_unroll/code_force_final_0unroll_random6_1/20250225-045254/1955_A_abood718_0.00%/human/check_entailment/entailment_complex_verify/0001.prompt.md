You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`. For each test case, it prints a result based on specific conditions: if `B * 2` is less than `C`, it prints `A * B`; if `A` is even, it prints half of `A` multiplied by `C`; otherwise, it prints `A` divided by 2 (integer division), followed by the result of `X * C + B` where `X` is `A` divided by 2.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Objective:** Determine the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts, given the price `a` for one yogurt and the price `b` for two yogurts.
2. **Conditions:**
   - If buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than the promotion price (`b`), then buy all yogurts at the regular price.
   - If `n` is even, buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price.
   - If `n` is odd, buy the maximum number of pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and buy the remaining yogurt at the regular price.

### Program Analysis
The provided program reads multiple test cases and processes each one as follows:
1. **Input Reading:** Reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` which correspond to `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively.
2. **Logic:**
   - If `2 * B < C`, it calculates the cost by multiplying the number of yogurts `A` by the price of one yogurt `B` and prints the result. This part is correct as it covers the scenario where buying individually is cheaper.
   - If `A % 2 == 0`, it calculates the cost by multiplying the number of pairs (`A // 2`) by the price of two yogurts `C` and prints the result. This is also correct for even numbers of yogurts.
   - If `A` is odd, it calculates the cost by buying `X` pairs of yogurts (`X = A // 2`) at the promotion price and then buying the remaining yogurt at the regular price. However, the program incorrectly prints `X` before printing the final cost. This extra print statement makes the program incorrect.

### Correctness Check
The program is incorrect due to the extra print statement `print(X)` which outputs an intermediate value instead of the final cost. This will cause the output to be incorrect and not match the expected format.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
