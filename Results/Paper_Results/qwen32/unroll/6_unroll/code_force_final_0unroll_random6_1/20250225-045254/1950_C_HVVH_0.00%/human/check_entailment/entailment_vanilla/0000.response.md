Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `day` is initialized to `'AM'`. This is not incorrect, but it might be misleading because it doesn't reflect the actual time until the first test case is processed.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n` from the input.
   - It then enters a loop that processes each test case.

3. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the program reads a time string in the format `hh:mm` and splits it into hours `h` and minutes `m`.
   - The conversion logic is as follows:
     - If `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and `day` to `'AM'`. This correctly handles midnight.
     - If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to `'PM'`. This correctly handles the PM range.
     - If `h` is 12 or less, it sets `day` to `'PM'` and then checks if `h` is 12. If so, it sets `day` to `'AM'`. This correctly handles noon.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the converted time in the format `hh:mm AM` or `hh:mm PM` using formatted strings to ensure leading zeroes are preserved.

### Specific Cases to Verify:

- **Midnight (00:00)**:
  - The program correctly converts `00:00` to `12:00 AM`.
  
- **Noon (12:00)**:
  - The program correctly converts `12:00` to `12:00 PM`.
  
- **PM Range (13:00 to 23:59)**:
  - The program correctly converts times like `13:00` to `01:00 PM` and `23:59` to `11:59 PM`.
  
- **AM Range (01:00 to 11:59)**:
  - The program correctly converts times like `01:00` to `01:00 AM` and `11:59` to `11:59 AM`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly handles all edge cases and the general cases as described in the problem statement. It accurately converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format while preserving the correct AM/PM designation and maintaining leading zeroes.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
