You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        p = [0] * n
        ind = n
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        print(*p)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple integers `n` from the input, each representing the length of a permutation `p`. For each `n`, it constructs a permutation `p` of numbers from 1 to `n` where even indices are filled in descending order starting from `n` and odd indices are filled in ascending order starting from 1 or 2 depending on the parity of `n`. The function then prints each constructed permutation.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
- We need to generate a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that there do not exist two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (with \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) where both \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

### Program Analysis:
The program generates a permutation by placing the largest numbers at even indices and the smallest numbers at odd indices. Specifically:
1. It starts by placing the largest number at the first position, the second largest at the third position, and so on.
2. Then, it places the smallest number at the second position, the second smallest at the fourth position, and so on.

### Potential Issues:
Let's consider a few cases to see if the program satisfies the problem requirements:

#### Case 1: \( n = 4 \)
- The program generates the permutation: \( [4, 1, 2, 3] \).
- Let's check if this permutation satisfies the condition:
  - For \( i = 1 \) and \( j = 3 \):
    - \( p_1 = 4 \) does not divide \( p_3 = 2 \).
    - \( p_2 = 1 \) does not divide \( p_4 = 3 \).
  - For \( i = 1 \) and \( j = 2 \):
    - \( p_1 = 4 \) does not divide \( p_2 = 1 \).
    - \( p_2 = 1 \) divides \( p_3 = 2 \), but \( p_3 = 2 \) does not divide \( p_4 = 3 \).
  - For \( i = 2 \) and \( j = 3 \):
    - \( p_2 = 1 \) does not divide \( p_3 = 2 \).
    - \( p_3 = 2 \) does not divide \( p_4 = 3 \).

The permutation \( [4, 1, 2, 3] \) seems to satisfy the condition.

#### Case 2: \( n = 6 \)
- The program generates the permutation: \( [6, 1, 5, 2, 4, 3] \).
- Let's check if this permutation satisfies the condition:
  - For \( i = 1 \) and \( j = 3 \):
    - \( p_1 = 6 \) does not divide \( p_3 = 5 \).
    - \( p_2 = 1 \) does not divide \( p_4 = 2 \).
  - For \( i = 1 \) and \( j = 4 \):
    - \( p_1 = 6 \) does not divide \( p_4 = 2 \).
    - \( p_2 = 1 \) does not divide \( p_5 = 4 \).
  - For \( i = 2 \) and \( j = 4 \):
    - \( p_2 = 1 \) does not divide \( p_4 = 2 \).
    - \( p_3 = 5 \) does not divide \( p_5 = 4 \).
  - For \( i = 3 \) and \( j = 5 \):
    - \( p_3 = 5 \) does not divide \( p_5 = 4 \).
    - \( p_4 = 2 \) does not divide \( p_6 = 3 \).

The permutation \( [6, 1, 5, 2, 4, 3] \) seems to satisfy the condition.

### General Case:
The program seems to generate a permutation that avoids the condition where \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \) by alternating between the largest and smallest available numbers. This approach ensures that no two consecutive numbers in the permutation are such that one divides the other in a way that would violate the condition.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program appears to be correct for the given problem description and the example cases provided. The logic seems to hold for various values of \( n \).

Correctness: **True**. The program generates a valid permutation for all tested cases, ensuring that no two consecutive numbers in the permutation violate the given condition.
