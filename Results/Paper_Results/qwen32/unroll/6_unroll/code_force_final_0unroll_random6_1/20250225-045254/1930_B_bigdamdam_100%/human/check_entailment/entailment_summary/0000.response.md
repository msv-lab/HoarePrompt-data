Reasoning:  
The program constructs a permutation for each test case by filling even indices in descending order starting from `n` and odd indices in ascending order starting from 1 or 2 depending on the parity of `n`. Let's analyze if this approach satisfies the condition that there do not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.

1. **Even indices filled in descending order:**  
   The even indices are filled with the largest numbers first. This means that for any two even indices `i` and `j` (with `i < j`), `p_i` will be greater than `p_j`. This ensures that `p_i` cannot divide `p_j` because `p_i` is larger.

2. **Odd indices filled in ascending order:**  
   The odd indices are filled with the smallest numbers first. This means that for any two odd indices `i` and `j` (with `i < j`), `p_i` will be smaller than `p_j`. This ensures that `p_i` cannot divide `p_j` because `p_i` is smaller.

3. **Cross-checking between even and odd indices:**  
   The largest number in the permutation is placed at the first even index, and the smallest number is placed at the first odd index. Since the even-indexed numbers are larger and the odd-indexed numbers are smaller, there is no way for a number at an even index to divide a number at an odd index and vice versa, except if the number at the odd index is 1, which cannot divide any number except itself.

Given these points, the constructed permutation ensures that `p_i` does not divide `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` does not divide `p_{j+1}` for any valid `i` and `j`. Therefore, the program satisfies the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
