You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        p = [0] * n
        ind = n
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        print(*p)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the permutation p. The function will be called multiple times with different values of n, and the sum of all n values across the test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        
        p = [0] * n
        
        ind = n
        
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
        
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        
        print(*p)
        
    #State: a permutation of numbers from 1 to n where even indices are filled in descending order starting from n and odd indices are filled in ascending order starting from 1 or 2 depending on the parity of n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple integers `n` from the input, each representing the length of a permutation `p`. For each `n`, it constructs a permutation `p` of numbers from 1 to `n` where even indices are filled in descending order starting from `n` and odd indices are filled in ascending order starting from 1 or 2 depending on the parity of `n`. The function then prints each constructed permutation.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to generate a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that there do not exist two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (with \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) where \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

### Program Analysis:
The program follows this approach:
1. It reads the number of test cases \( t \).
2. For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \).
3. It initializes a list \( p \) of length \( n \) with zeros.
4. It fills the even indices of \( p \) with the largest numbers in descending order (starting from \( n \)).
5. It fills the odd indices of \( p \) with the smallest numbers in ascending order (starting from \( 1 + n \% 2 \)).

Let's break down the filling process:
- The even indices are filled with \( n, n-2, n-4, \ldots \) until all even indices are filled.
- The odd indices are filled with \( 1 + n \% 2, 3, 5, \ldots \) until all odd indices are filled.

### Verification:
To ensure the correctness, let's check if the generated permutation satisfies the condition that there do not exist two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

1. **Even and Odd Separation**:
   - By filling even indices with descending larger numbers and odd indices with ascending smaller numbers, we ensure that the values in even and odd positions do not overlap in a way that could cause the divisibility condition to be violated.
   
2. **Divisibility Condition**:
   - Since the even-indexed elements are larger and decreasing, and the odd-indexed elements are smaller and increasing, it is less likely for the divisibility condition to be satisfied.
   - Specifically, the largest possible value in the even positions is \( n \), and the smallest possible value in the odd positions is \( 1 + n \% 2 \). Given the constraints, it is highly improbable for the divisibility condition to hold true across different pairs of \( i \) and \( j \).

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the example given in the problem statement:

- For \( n = 4 \):
  - Even indices: Fill with \( 4, 2 \)
  - Odd indices: Fill with \( 1, 3 \)
  - Resulting permutation: \( [4, 1, 2, 3] \)

- For \( n = 3 \):
  - Even indices: Fill with \( 3 \)
  - Odd indices: Fill with \( 1, 2 \)
  - Resulting permutation: \( [3, 1, 2] \)

In both cases, the generated permutations satisfy the condition that there do not exist two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided program correctly generates a valid permutation for each test case under the given constraints.
