The loop in question is:

```python
for i in us:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`, but since `i` is being iterated over the elements of `us`, the state that needs to be adjusted is `us` itself. Specifically, `us` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input, where 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is the newly input string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is an empty set; `ans` is a list containing the characters that completed sets of `k` unique characters found in `s`; `ps` is an integer representing the number of complete sets of `k` unique characters found in `s`; and `ps` is less than `n`.

To ensure the loop executes, `us` must contain at least one element. Given that `us` is described as a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `k` is at least 1, `us` should already contain at least one element. However, to explicitly state the requirement for the loop to execute, we confirm that `us` should not be an empty set.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input, where 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is the newly input string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and must not be empty; `win` is an empty set; `ans` is a list containing the characters that completed sets of `k` unique characters found in `s`; `ps` is an integer representing the number of complete sets of `k` unique characters found in `s`; and `ps` is less than `n`**.
