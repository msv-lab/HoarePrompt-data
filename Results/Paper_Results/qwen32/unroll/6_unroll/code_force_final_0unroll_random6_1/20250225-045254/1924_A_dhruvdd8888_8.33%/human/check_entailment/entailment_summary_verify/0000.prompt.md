You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Program:
from collections import *
from math import *
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *
from random import randint

rrr = randint(8888, 88888)
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set((chr(i + 97) for i in range(k)))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
    if ps >= n:
        return print('YES')
    print('NO')
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` contains at least `n` disjoint sets of `k` unique characters from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If such sets are found, it prints 'YES'. If not, it prints 'NO' and then prints additional strings based on the characters not found in the sets.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. There are several issues with the logic of the program:

1. **Incorrect Subsequence Checking**: The program attempts to check for subsequences by maintaining a set `win` and adding characters from `s` to it. However, it clears the set `win` once it reaches `k` unique characters, which does not correctly simulate the process of checking for subsequences. Subsequences can be formed by characters that are not necessarily contiguous or unique.

2. **Subsequence Construction**: The program tries to construct a subsequence of length `n` using characters from `s` that are part of `us`. However, it does not correctly handle the construction of all possible subsequences of length `n` and instead relies on a flawed mechanism of adding characters to `ans`.

3. **Output Generation**: The program attempts to generate a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`, but the logic used is incorrect. It does not ensure that the generated string is indeed not a subsequence of `s`.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness of the program:

**Input:**
```
1
2 2 4
abba
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Program Output:**
```
NO
aa
```

The program incorrectly identifies `aa` as not being a subsequence of `abba`, which is not true. The string `abba` contains the subsequences `aa`, `ab`, `ba`, and `bb`, so the correct output should be `YES`.

To correctly solve this problem, a different approach is needed, such as generating all possible strings of length `n` and checking if each one is a subsequence of `s`. Alternatively, a more efficient approach might involve using dynamic programming or other advanced techniques to handle the large number of test cases within the given constraints.
