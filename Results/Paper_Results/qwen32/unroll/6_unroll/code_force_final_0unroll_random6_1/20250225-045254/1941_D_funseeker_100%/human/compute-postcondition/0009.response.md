Let's break down the problem step by step based on the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
1. `ans` is a set containing all players who have held the ball after all throws.
2. If 0 was originally in `ans`, it is excluded.
3. `n` is included in `ans` regardless of whether 0 was originally in `ans` or not.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*sorted(ans))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Set `ans`**: This set contains players who have held the ball. The exact players are not specified, but we know the following:
   - If 0 was originally in `ans`, it is removed.
   - `n` is always included in the final set `ans`.

2. **Sorting**: The `sorted(ans)` function sorts the elements of the set `ans` in ascending order.

3. **Unpacking with `*` Operator**: The `*` operator unpacks the sorted list, meaning each element of the sorted list is printed separated by spaces.

### Output Description:
- The output will be a space-separated list of players (integers) in ascending order who have held the ball, with 0 excluded if it was originally in the set, and `n` included.
- The exact values depend on the original set `ans` and the value of `n`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact contents of the set `ans` before the modification and the value of `n` are not provided, we can't list the exact integers. However, we can describe the output format based on the given conditions.

Output: **sorted players (excluding 0 if originally present, including n) in ascending order**
