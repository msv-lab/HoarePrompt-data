#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_1`. It seems to be a placeholder function that reads a line from standard input.
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns a string that is the line read from standard input, with any leading or trailing whitespace removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a line from standard input and returns it as a string with any leading or trailing whitespace removed.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No relevant variables are present in the function signature for `func_2`. The function does not have any parameters and thus there are no preconditions related to its input variables.
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())
    #The program returns the integer value returned by `func_1()`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns the integer value returned by `func_1()`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters. It relies on the output of `func_1()` which is expected to return a string that can be split into a list of integers.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers that were originally part of a string returned by `func_1()`, where the string was split into parts and each part was converted to an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` processes a string of integers returned by `func_1()`, splits the string into individual parts, converts each part into an integer, and returns a list of these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of players (2 <= n <= 1000), m is an integer representing the number of throws (1 <= m <= 1000), and x is an integer representing the initial player with the ball (1 <= x <= n).
def func_4():
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)
        
        temp = set()
        
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        
        ans = temp
        
    #State: ans is a set containing all players who have held the ball after all throws.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: `ans` is a set containing all players who have held the ball after all throws. If 0 was originally in `ans`, it is excluded, and `n` is included in `ans`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: The code prints the length of the set `ans` after the modifications. The length is the number of players who have held the ball after all throws, excluding `0` if it was originally included, and including `n`.
    #
    #Output:
    print(*sorted(ans))
    #This is printed: sorted players (excluding 0 if originally present, including n) in ascending order
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines and prints the number of unique players who have held the ball after a series of throws, starting from a specified player. It also prints the sorted list of these players, adjusting for circular player numbering.
