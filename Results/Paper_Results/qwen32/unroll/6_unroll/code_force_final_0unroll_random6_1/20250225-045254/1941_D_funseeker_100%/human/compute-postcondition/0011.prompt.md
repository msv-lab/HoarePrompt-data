You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of players (2 <= n <= 1000), m is an integer representing the number of throws (1 <= m <= 1000), and x is an integer representing the initial player with the ball (1 <= x <= n).
def func_4():
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)
        
        temp = set()
        
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        
        ans = temp
        
    #State: ans is a set containing all players who have held the ball after all throws.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: `ans` is a set containing all players who have held the ball after all throws. If 0 was originally in `ans`, it is excluded, and `n` is included in `ans`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: The code prints the length of the set `ans` after the modifications. The length is the number of players who have held the ball after all throws, excluding `0` if it was originally included, and including `n`.
    #
    #Output:
    print(*sorted(ans))
    #This is printed: sorted players (excluding 0 if originally present, including n) in ascending order
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of players, an integer between 2 and 1000), `m` (the number of throws, an integer between 1 and 1000), and `x` (the initial player with the ball, an integer between 1 and n). The function returns the player number who ends up with the ball after `m` throws, assuming the ball is passed to the next player in a circular fashion starting from player `x`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
