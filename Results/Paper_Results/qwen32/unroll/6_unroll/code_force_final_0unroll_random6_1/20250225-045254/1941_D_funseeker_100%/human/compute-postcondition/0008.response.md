Let's break down the problem step by step based on the initial state provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ans` is a set containing all players who have held the ball after all throws.
   - If `0` was originally in `ans`, it is excluded.
   - `n` is included in `ans` regardless of its original presence.
   - `n` is not specified to be 0, so we can assume `n` is a distinct value.

2. **Effect on `ans`:**
   - If `0` was in `ans`, it is removed.
   - `n` is added to `ans`.

3. **Final State of `ans`:**
   - The set `ans` initially contains some players (let's call this set `S`).
   - If `0` was in `S`, it is removed.
   - `n` is added to the resulting set.

4. **Calculation of `len(ans)`:**
   - The length of `ans` is the number of elements in the set after the above modifications.
   - If `0` was in `S`, the length of `ans` is the length of `S` minus 1 (since `0` is removed) plus 1 (since `n` is added).
   - If `0` was not in `S`, the length of `ans` is the length of `S` plus 1 (since `n` is added).

Since `n` is guaranteed to be included and `0` is excluded if present, the final length of `ans` is the original number of elements in `S` (excluding `0` if it was there) plus 1.

**Output:**
The code prints the length of the set `ans` after the modifications. The length is the number of players who have held the ball after all throws, excluding `0` if it was originally included, and including `n`.

Output: **len(ans) (where ans is the set of players who have held the ball after all throws, excluding 0 if it was originally included, and including n)**
