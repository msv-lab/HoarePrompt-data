Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99, and the length of lst, n, satisfies 2 <= n <= 50; `sorted_lst` is a sorted version of `lst` where the integers are in non-decreasing order.**

In simple terms, the list `lst` remains unchanged, while a new list `sorted_lst` is created which contains the same integers as `lst` but arranged in ascending order.
