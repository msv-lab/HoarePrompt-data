### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the list and checking if any element is out of order and greater than or equal to 10. If such an element is found, it splits the element into its digits and reinserts them into the list in their respective positions. After attempting to sort the list in this manner, it checks if the list is sorted by calling the function `func_1`.

However, there are a few issues with the approach:

1. **Single Pass Limitation**: The program only makes one pass through the list to perform the splitting operation. This is insufficient because after splitting an element, the newly inserted elements might still be out of order and might require further splitting. The program does not account for this and does not recheck the list after each modification.

2. **Inefficient and Incomplete Handling**: The program only considers splitting the element if it is greater than the next element and greater than or equal to 10. This is not sufficient to ensure that the list can be sorted by repeated splitting. For instance, if the list is `[20, 1]`, the program will split `20` into `2` and `0`, but the list will still be out of order (`[2, 0, 1]`), and the program will incorrectly conclude that sorting is not possible.

3. **Lack of Iterative Correction**: The program does not repeatedly attempt to sort the list after each split operation. This iterative process is necessary to ensure that all elements are correctly placed in order after splitting.

Given these points, the program does not correctly determine if the list can be sorted by repeatedly applying the allowed operation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
