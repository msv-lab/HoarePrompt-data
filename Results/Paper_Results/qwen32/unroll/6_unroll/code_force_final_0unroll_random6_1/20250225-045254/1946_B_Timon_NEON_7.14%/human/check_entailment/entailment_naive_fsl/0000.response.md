Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code is incomplete and does not fully implement the solution as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code does not perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array after k operations. The function `func_3` is defined but not implemented, and the overall logic to achieve the desired result is missing.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incomplete Implementation**: The function `func_3` is defined but does not contain any logic to perform the required operations. The function `func_2` is supposed to find the maximum segment sum, but it does not handle all edge cases, such as arrays with all negative numbers or arrays with a single element.

2. **Lack of Main Logic**: The code does not include the main logic to perform k operations and maximize the sum of the array. It only identifies the maximum segment sum, which is a part of the solution but not the complete solution.

3. **No Handling of Multiple Test Cases**: The code does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. It does not read input for multiple test cases and process each one accordingly.

4. **No Modulo Operation**: The code does not perform the modulo operation `10^9 + 7` on the final result, which is required according to the problem statement.

To make the code correct, it needs to be completed with the logic to perform k operations, handle all edge cases, and process multiple test cases. Here's a possible outline of what the correct code should do:

- Read the number of test cases.
- For each test case, read the values of n and k, and the array a.
- Calculate the maximum subarray sum using an algorithm like Kadane's.
- Perform k operations by repeatedly adding the maximum subarray sum to the array.
- Keep track of the total sum and perform the modulo operation `10^9 + 7` at the end.

Since the provided code does not implement these steps, it is incorrect.
