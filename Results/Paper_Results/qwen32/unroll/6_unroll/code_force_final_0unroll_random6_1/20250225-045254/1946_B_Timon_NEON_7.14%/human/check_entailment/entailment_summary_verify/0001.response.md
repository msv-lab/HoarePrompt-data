Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to evaluate its correctness based on the problem description, provided code, and function summaries.

### Problem Description Recap
- **Objective**: Maximize the sum of an array `a` of `n` integers after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting that sum anywhere in the array.
- **Output**: The maximum sum modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Provided Code Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: Computes the modulo \(10^9 + 7\) of a given number.
   - **Implementation**: Correct and useful for the final result.
   - **Summary**: Matches the function's purpose.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: Find the maximum subarray sum and its indices.
   - **Implementation**: The code is an attempt to find segments but lacks correctness in handling edge cases and does not return the maximum subarray sum correctly.
   - **Summary**: The summary does not align with the actual implementation, which is flawed.
   - **Issue**: The function does not correctly implement Kadane's algorithm or any other method to find the maximum subarray sum.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - **Purpose**: Compute the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.
   - **Implementation**: Not implemented at all. The function is just initialized with `answer = 0` and does not perform any calculations.
   - **Summary**: The summary does not align with the actual implementation, which is incomplete.

### Key Observations

- **Kadane's Algorithm**: To maximize the sum, the optimal strategy is to repeatedly insert the sum of the maximum subarray (subarray with the largest sum) obtained from the current array. This is because the sum of the maximum subarray will always yield the highest possible increase in the total sum of the array.
- **Handling Negative Sums**: If the maximum subarray sum is non-positive, the best strategy is to add zeros (i.e., the sum of an empty subarray).

### Issues in the Code

- **Incomplete Implementation**: `func_3` is not implemented and does not perform the necessary calculations to determine the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.
- **Incorrect Implementation**: `func_2` does not correctly find the maximum subarray sum. It seems to be attempting to find segments but does not handle all edge cases correctly.

### Final Evaluation

Based on the analysis, the provided code is incomplete and does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Specifically, the function `func_3` is not implemented, and the function `func_2` is not correctly finding the maximum subarray sum.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Final: False**
