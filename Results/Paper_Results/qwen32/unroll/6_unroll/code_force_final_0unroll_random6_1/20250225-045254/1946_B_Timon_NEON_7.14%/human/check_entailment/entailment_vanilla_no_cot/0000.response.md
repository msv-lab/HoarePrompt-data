Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. Here is a detailed analysis of what is wrong with the given program:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly computes the modulo 10^9 + 7 of a given number. However, it is not used anywhere in the provided code, which suggests it might be a leftover or an incomplete part of the solution.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function attempts to find the maximum subarray sum and its indices. However, it does not handle all edge cases properly. For example, if all elements are negative, the function might return incorrect results. Additionally, the logic for tracking segments and their sums is flawed, and it might not always find the correct maximum subarray.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function is incomplete and does not perform any operations. It is supposed to compute the final result based on the maximum subarray found and the number of operations `k`, but it is not implemented at all.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to use a well-known algorithm called Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum efficiently. Once we have the maximum subarray sum, we can use it to compute the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations.

Here's a high-level outline of the correct approach:

1. Use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum.
2. If the maximum subarray sum is positive, the optimal strategy is to repeatedly add this subarray sum to the array.
3. If the maximum subarray sum is non-positive, the optimal strategy is to add zeros (i.e., empty subarrays) to the array.
4. Compute the final sum of the array after `k` operations and take it modulo 10^9 + 7.

The provided code does not implement this logic, so it is incorrect.
