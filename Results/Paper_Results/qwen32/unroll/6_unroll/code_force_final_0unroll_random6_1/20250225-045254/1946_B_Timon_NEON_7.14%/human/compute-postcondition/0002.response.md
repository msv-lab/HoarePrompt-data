Functionality: **The function `func_3` takes two parameters: `number`, an integer representing the length of an array, and `quantity`, a non-negative integer representing the number of operations. It initializes a variable `answer` to 0 and performs operations based on these inputs, ultimately returning the value of `answer`.**
