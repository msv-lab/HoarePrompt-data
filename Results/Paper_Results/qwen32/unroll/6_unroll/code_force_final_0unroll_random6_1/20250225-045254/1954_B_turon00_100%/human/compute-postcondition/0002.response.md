To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand what the loop does. The loop processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. The goal is to find the length of the shortest contiguous subarray in `a` that contains all elements of the same value, and if no such subarray exists (i.e., all elements are unique or `n == 1`), the output is `-1`.

After processing each test case, the variables `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `cnt`, and `ans` are modified. However, after each iteration, these variables are re-initialized for the next test case. The only persistent output is the result printed for each test case.

Since the loop processes each test case independently and the state of the variables is reset for each new test case, the final output state is simply the series of printed results for each test case. There are no variables that retain their values across iterations of the outer loop.

Output State: **a series of printed results for each test case, where each result is either the length of the shortest contiguous subarray of identical elements or `-1` if no such subarray exists.**
