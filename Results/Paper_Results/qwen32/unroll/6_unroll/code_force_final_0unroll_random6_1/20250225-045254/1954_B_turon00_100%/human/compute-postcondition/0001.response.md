The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. Since the loop will iterate `t` times, for the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is the input integer representing the number of test cases, 1 <= t <= 10^4**
