Output State: **`tree` is an instance of a Tree class representing a tree structure with n vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges, `stack` is `[(s, False)]`.**

In this output state, the variable `stack` has been initialized with a single tuple containing the starting vertex `s` and a boolean value `False`. The other variables (`tree`, `s`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
