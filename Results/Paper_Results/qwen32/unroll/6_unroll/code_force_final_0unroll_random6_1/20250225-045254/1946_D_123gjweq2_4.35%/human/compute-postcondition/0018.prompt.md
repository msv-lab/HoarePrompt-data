You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers, and bit is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= bit < 30.
def find_max(cur_arr, bit):
    if (bit == -1) :
        return len(cur_arr)
        #The program returns the length of the list `cur_arr` which contains non-negative integers.
    #State: `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, and `bit` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30. `bit` is not equal to -1
    new_arr = []
    xor = 0
    thing1 = 0
    for i in cur_arr:
        xor ^= i
        
        if not xor >> bit & 1:
            new_arr.append(xor)
            xor = 0
        
    #State: `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30, `new_arr` is a list containing the values of `xor` that were appended during the loop, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0.
    if (xor >> bit & 1) :
        thing1 = -1
    else :
        thing1 = find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)
    #State: `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30, `new_arr` is a list containing the values of `xor` that were appended during the loop, `xor` is 0. If the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 1, then `thing1` is -1. Otherwise, `thing1` is the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`.
    if (x >> bit & 1) :
        return max(find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1), len(new_arr))
        #The program returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`.
    else :
        return thing1
        #The program returns the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `find_max` accepts two parameters: `cur_arr`, which is a list of non-negative integers, and `bit`, which is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= bit < 30. The function returns the length of the list `cur_arr` if `bit` is 0. If `bit` is greater than 0, it returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`, where `new_arr` is presumably derived from `cur_arr` based on some criteria involving `bit`. Alternatively, if certain conditions are met, it returns the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)` directly.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the length of the list `cur_arr` which contains non-negative integers.

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`.

Case_3: The program returns the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
