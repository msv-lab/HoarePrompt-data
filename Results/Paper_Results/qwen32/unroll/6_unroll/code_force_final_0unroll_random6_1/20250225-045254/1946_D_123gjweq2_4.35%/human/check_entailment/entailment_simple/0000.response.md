### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and its components to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array) and `x` (the maximum allowed bitwise OR of XOR values).
   - Then, it reads the array `arr` of length `n`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to find the maximum number of segments `k` such that the bitwise OR of XOR values of these segments is less than or equal to `x`.
   - However, the function `func_1` is incorrectly implemented. It calls `find_max(arr, 31)`, which is not aligned with the problem's requirement. The second parameter should be `x`, not `31`.

3. **Function `find_max`:**
   - This function is intended to recursively determine the maximum number of segments by considering the bits of `x` from the most significant to the least significant.
   - It uses a divide-and-conquer approach to split the array into segments where the XOR of each segment has the `bit`-th bit unset (0).
   - If the `bit`-th bit of `x` is set (1), it returns the maximum of:
     - The result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)`, which means considering the next bit.
     - The length of `new_arr`, which represents the number of segments found so far.
   - If the `bit`-th bit of `x` is unset (0), it returns `thing1`, which is either:
     - `-1` if the `bit`-th bit of the final `xor` is set (1).
     - The result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)` otherwise.

### Issues:
- The main issue lies in the incorrect call to `find_max` in `func_1`. It should be `find_max(arr, x)` instead of `find_max(arr, 31)`.
- The function `find_max` correctly implements the logic to split the array into segments based on the bits of `x`, but it is not being used correctly due to the wrong parameter in `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the program is incorrect as it does not correctly use the function `find_max` with the required parameter `x`. Therefore, the program does not solve the problem as intended.

**Correctness: False**
