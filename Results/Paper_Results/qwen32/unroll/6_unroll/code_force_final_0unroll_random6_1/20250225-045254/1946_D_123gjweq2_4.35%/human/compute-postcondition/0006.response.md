The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over `cur_arr`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `cur_arr` must have at least one element. The state of `bit`, `new_arr`, `xor`, and `thing1` do not affect whether the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Given that `cur_arr` must have at least one element for the loop to execute, we can adjust the state of `cur_arr` accordingly.

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30, `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0**
