### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by constructing an array `a` such that each `x_i` is the remainder of `a_i` divided by `a_{i-1}`. However, the logic in the function `func_1` does not guarantee that the generated array `a` will satisfy the condition `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`.

Let's break down the function `func_1`:

1. **Initialization**: The first element of the array `ans` is set to `arr[0] + 1`. This is somewhat arbitrary and does not necessarily ensure that `ans[1] % ans[0] == arr[0]`.

2. **Loop for Middle Elements**: For each subsequent element from index `1` to `n-2`, the code calculates `ans[i + 1]` as `arr[i] + ans[i]`. If this value is not greater than `arr[i + 1]`, it keeps adding `ans[i]` until `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]`. However, this logic does not guarantee that `ans[i + 1] % ans[i] == arr[i + 1]`. In fact, the loop only ensures that `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]`, but it does not guarantee the correct modulus condition.

3. **Last Element**: The last element `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`. This again does not guarantee that `ans[-1] % ans[-2] == arr[-1]`.

### Example Analysis:

Let's consider the first test case from the example:

**Input:**
```
4
2 4 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3 5 4 9
```

**Explanation:**
- `a_1 = 3`
- `a_2 = 5`, and `5 % 3 = 2 = x_2`
- `a_3 = 4`, and `4 % 5 = 4 = x_3`
- `a_4 = 9`, and `9 % 4 = 1 = x_4`

However, the function `func_1` does not guarantee this or any other correct sequence. For instance, if the function were to generate `a_1 = 3`, `a_2 = 5`, `a_3 = 19`, `a_4 = 20` (which is not the case, but just for illustration), then `19 % 5 != 4`.

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly ensure that the generated array `a` satisfies the required conditions for all test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

**Correctness: False**
