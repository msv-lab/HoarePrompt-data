You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes a list `arr` of `n-1` integers and an integer `n`, and returns a list `ans` of `n` integers. The first element of `ans` is `arr[0] + 1`. For each subsequent element from index `1` to `n-2`, `ans[i]` is the smallest number greater than `arr[i]` that is a multiple of `ans[i-1]` plus `arr[i-1]`. The last element `ans[-1]` is the sum of `ans[-2]` and `arr[-1]`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Breakdown:
The task is to construct an array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` given an array `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n` such that:
- Each `a_i` is between 1 and 10^9.
- For each `i` from 2 to `n`, `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}`.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case:
1. It reads `n`, the length of the array `a`.
2. It reads the array `x` of length `n-1`.
3. It calls `func_1(arr, n)` to compute the array `a`.
4. It prints the array `a`.

#### Function `func_1(arr, n)`:
- Initializes an array `ans` of size `n` with all elements set to 0.
- Sets `ans[0]` to `arr[0] + 1`. This is a reasonable choice because `a_1` can be any number greater than `x_2` to ensure `x_2 = a_2 % a_1`.
- Iterates from `i = 0` to `n-3` (inclusive) and for each `i`:
  - Sets `ans[i+1]` to `arr[i] + ans[i]`.
  - If `ans[i+1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i+1]`, it increments `ans[i+1]` by `ans[i]` until `ans[i+1] > arr[i+1]`. This step ensures `ans[i+1] % ans[i] == arr[i+1]`.
- Finally, it sets `ans[-1]` to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.

### Issues in the Provided Program:
1. **Initialization of `ans[0]`**: The program sets `ans[0]` to `arr[0] + 1`, which is not necessarily correct. `a_1` can be any number greater than `x_2` but does not have to be `x_2 + 1`. It could be any value that satisfies the constraints.
2. **Loop Range**: The loop iterates from `0` to `n-3`, which is incorrect. It should iterate from `0` to `n-2` to properly handle all elements of `arr`.
3. **Final Element Calculation**: The final element `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`. This might not always satisfy `ans[-1] % ans[-2] == arr[-1]`.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified above, the program does not always produce a correct array `a` that satisfies the conditions for all test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
