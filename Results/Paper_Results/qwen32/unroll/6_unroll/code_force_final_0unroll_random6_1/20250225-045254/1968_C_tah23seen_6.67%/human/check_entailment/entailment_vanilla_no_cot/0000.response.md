Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem for all test cases. The approach in the `func_1` function is flawed and does not guarantee that the resulting array `a` will satisfy the condition `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`.

Let's analyze the provided code:

1. The function initializes `ans[0]` to `arr[0] + 1`. This is a reasonable choice because it ensures `ans[0] > arr[0]`, but it does not guarantee that the subsequent elements will satisfy the modulo condition.

2. For the loop `for i in range(n - 2)`, it sets `ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]`. This is not guaranteed to satisfy the condition `arr[i] == ans[i + 1] % ans[i]`. The loop also contains a while loop to adjust `ans[i + 1]` if it is less than `arr[i + 1]`, but this adjustment is not sufficient to ensure that the modulo condition holds.

3. The last element `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`, which again does not guarantee that `arr[-1] == ans[-1] % ans[-2]`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that for each `i`, `ans[i]` is chosen such that `arr[i] == ans[i] % ans[i - 1]`. One simple way to achieve this is to choose `ans[i - 1]` to be a number larger than `arr[i]` and set `ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + arr[i]`. This guarantees that `ans[i] % ans[i - 1] == arr[i]`.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1  # Choose a number larger than arr[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + arr[i - 1]  # Ensure arr[i-1] == ans[i] % ans[i-1]
    return ans
```

This corrected function should work correctly for all valid inputs.
