Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Problem Description Recap
- **Operations:**
  1. Append an integer `x` to the end of array `a`.
  2. Append `x` copies of array `a` to the end of array `a`.
- **Queries:** For each query `k`, return the `k`-th element of the array `a` after all operations.

#### Program Code Recap
```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        print(*result)
```

#### Annotations Recap
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points, but they do not explicitly highlight the critical flaw in the implementation of the second type of operation.

#### Evaluation of the Program
1. **Initialization:**
   - The program correctly initializes an empty list `array` and a list `result` to store the answers to the queries.

2. **Processing Operations:**
   - **Operation Type 1:** The program correctly appends the value `value` to the `array`.
   - **Operation Type 2:** The program uses `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` to extend the array. This effectively duplicates the current array only once, not `x` times as required. This is a critical error in the program.

3. **Answering Queries:**
   - The program correctly calculates the `(k - 1) % len(array)` index and appends the element at that index to the `result` list. However, since the array is not constructed correctly due to the error in operation type 2, the answers to the queries will be incorrect.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case, but these results are based on an incorrectly constructed array.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate. The critical issue lies in the implementation of the second type of operation. The code does not correctly handle the operation of appending `x` copies of the array to itself; instead, it only appends the array once to itself. This results in incorrect array constructions and, consequently, incorrect answers to the queries.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
