### Reasoning:

The given program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic and correctness:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of operations) and `q` (number of queries).
   - It then reads `n` operations and `q` queries.
   - It calls `func_1` with these inputs and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes the operations and queries.
   - It initializes an empty list `array` to store the elements of the array.
   - It iterates over the operations:
     - If the operation is of type 1, it appends the given integer `x` to the `array`.
     - If the operation is of type 2, it appends the entire `array` to itself `x` times using `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])`. However, this is incorrect because it does not append `x` copies of the current array; it appends the current array to itself once. The correct way would be to multiply the array by `x` and extend it, or use a more efficient method to handle large `x` values.
   - After processing all operations, it processes the queries:
     - For each query `k`, it calculates the element at position `(k - 1) % len(array)` and appends it to the `result` list.
     - It returns the `result` list.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Handling of Operation Type 2**:
  - The current implementation of operation type 2 appends the array to itself only once, not `x` times. This is incorrect and will produce incorrect results for operation type 2 when `x > 1`.
  - To correctly handle this, the array should be multiplied by `x` and then extended to itself, or a more efficient method should be used to manage the large size of the array.

### Correctness:
Given the issues with handling operation type 2, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
