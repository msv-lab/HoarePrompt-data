Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided code has a critical issue in handling the second type of operation (where Jayden appends `x` copies of the current array to itself). The code currently uses a list comprehension to extend the array, which is inefficient and incorrect for large values of `x` (up to \(10^9\)). This will result in a memory overflow or extremely slow execution.

Here's a detailed explanation of the problem:

1. **Memory Overflow**: When `x` is large (up to \(10^9\)), the code attempts to create a new list that is `x` times the size of the current array. This will quickly exceed memory limits, especially since the sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases can be as large as \(10^5\).

2. **Inefficiency**: Even if memory were not an issue, the operation of extending the list with `x` copies is \(O(x \cdot \text{len(array)})\), which is computationally expensive and will not meet the time constraints for large `x`.

### Correct Approach:

To handle the problem correctly, we need to avoid actually constructing the array and instead keep track of the structure of the array using a more efficient method. One possible approach is to use a tree-like structure or a segment tree to keep track of the segments of the array and their sizes. This way, we can answer queries in logarithmic time without ever constructing the full array.

### Example of a Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following test case:

```
1
1 1
2 1000000000
1
```

In this case, the program will attempt to create a new list that is 1 billion times the size of the current array (which is empty), resulting in a memory overflow or extremely slow execution.

### Conclusion:

The provided code is incorrect because it does not handle the second type of operation efficiently and correctly for large values of `x`. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
