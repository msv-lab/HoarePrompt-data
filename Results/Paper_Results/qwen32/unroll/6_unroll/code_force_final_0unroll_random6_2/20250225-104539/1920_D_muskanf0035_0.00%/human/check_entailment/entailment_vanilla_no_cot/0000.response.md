Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the operations described in the problem statement. Specifically, the handling of operation type 2 (appending x copies of the array to itself) is incorrect. The current implementation extends the array with itself only once, instead of appending x copies of the array.

Here is a brief explanation of the issues:

- **Operation Type 2:** The code currently extends the array with itself only once using `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])`, which is equivalent to `array.extend(array)`. This is incorrect because the problem statement specifies that x copies of the array should be appended to the end of the array, not just one copy.

To fix this, you need to replace the line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` with a loop or a more efficient way to append x copies of the array to itself. Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            # Append x copies of the current array to itself
            array.extend(array * (value - 1))
    for k in queries:
        # Adjust for 1-based indexing and handle large k values
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result
```

With this correction, the program should work as expected for the given problem statement.
