You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

Note

In the first test case:

  * After the first operation a = [1] ;
  * After the second operation a = [1, 2] ;
  * After the third operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2] ;
  * After the fourth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] ;
  * After the fifth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] .

In the fourth test case, after all operations a = [1, 2] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning: 

Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `array` and a list `result` to store the answers to the queries.
   
2. **Processing Operations**:
   - The program iterates through each operation. 
   - If the operation type `op_type` is 1, it appends the value `value` to the `array`.
   - If the operation type `op_type` is 2, it attempts to extend the `array` by duplicating its current contents `value` times. However, the code provided does not actually duplicate the array `value` times but instead duplicates it only once. This is a critical error in the program as it does not correctly implement the second type of operation as described in the problem statement.

3. **Answering Queries**:
   - The program then processes each query. For each query `k`, it calculates the `(k - 1) % len(array)` index and appends the element at that index to the `result` list. This part of the code is correct assuming the `array` has been constructed correctly according to the problem statement.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

Given the analysis, the primary issue lies in the implementation of the second type of operation. The code does not correctly handle the operation of appending `x` copies of the array to itself. Instead, it only appends the array once to itself, which results in incorrect array constructions and, consequently, incorrect answers to the queries.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
