The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute `t` times, so the only state we need to adjust is `t` to ensure that the loop can execute. The loop body is omitted, so we don't need to consider any variables or states that might be modified or initialized within the loop.

Since the problem specifies that `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, the loop will execute as long as `t` is within this range. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure that the loop executes. However, we should clarify that `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500**
