Reasoning:  
The problem requires us to divide the books into two non-empty piles and then select the book with the highest number of pages from each pile to maximize the total number of pages Alice can read.

The provided program first reads the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of books and their respective page counts. It then sorts the list of page counts in descending order. Finally, it prints the sum of the two highest page counts.

This approach works because the two largest numbers in the sorted list represent the highest number of pages in each pile if we split the books optimally. By selecting the two largest numbers, we ensure that the sum of the pages read is maximized.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
