The code snippet creates a list of tuples called `pq` where each tuple consists of a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index. The order of the tuples in `pq` is the same as the order of the prices in the `prices` list.

Given the initial state, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. The list `prices` is also unchanged, but a new list `pq` is created based on `prices`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9), `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and `pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple is (price, i) for i, price in enumerate(prices).**
