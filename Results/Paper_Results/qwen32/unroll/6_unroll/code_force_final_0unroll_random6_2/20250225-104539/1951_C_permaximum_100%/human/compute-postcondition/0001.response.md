The given Python code snippet uses `heapq.heapify()` to transform the list `pq` into a heap, which is an in-place operation. This operation rearranges the elements in `pq` to satisfy the heap property, but it does not change the values of the elements themselves. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9), `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple is (price, i) for i, price in enumerate(prices).**
