Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n; `input` is assigned the value of the input read from standard input; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the space-separated values from the input.**

Explanation: The `input()` function reads a line from the standard input, and `split()` divides this line into a list of substrings based on spaces. Therefore, `data` will be a list of strings, where each string is one of the space-separated values from the input. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a_i` remain unchanged, but `data` now holds the parsed input as a list of strings.
