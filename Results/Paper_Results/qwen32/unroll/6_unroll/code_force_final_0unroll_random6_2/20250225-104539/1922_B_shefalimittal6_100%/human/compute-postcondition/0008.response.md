To determine what will be printed by the `print('\n'.join(results))` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the context in which the `results` list is populated.

### Analysis of the Initial State:
1. **`t`**: This is an integer that represents the number of test cases, derived from the first element of the `data` list (`int(data[0])`).
2. **`n`**: This is the last value of `n` read from the `data` list during the last iteration of a loop. `n` typically represents the number of integers in each test case.
3. **`a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`**: These are the last set of integers read from the `data` list during the last iteration of the loop. Each `a_i` is an integer in the current test case.
4. **`input`**: This variable holds the value of the input read from standard input.
5. **`data`**: This is a list of strings, where each string is a space-separated value from the input. Typically, `data` is constructed by splitting the input string.
6. **`idx`**: This is the index in the `data` list after the last integer read during the last iteration of the loop.
7. **`results`**: This is a list that contains the results for each of the `t` test cases. Each element in the `results` list is the result of processing one test case.

### The `print` Statement:
The `print('\n'.join(results))` statement will concatenate all the strings in the `results` list, separating each string with a newline character (`\n`). This means that each result from the test cases will be printed on a new line.

### Output:
Since the exact contents of the `results` list are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of what the `results` list contains. Each element in the `results` list is the result of processing one of the `t` test cases.

Output: **Each result from the test cases, separated by newlines (where each result is an element in the `results` list)**
