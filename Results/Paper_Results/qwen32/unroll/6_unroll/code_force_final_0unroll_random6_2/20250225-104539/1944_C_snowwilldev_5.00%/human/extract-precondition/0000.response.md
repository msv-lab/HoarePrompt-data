Precondition: **Each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array a, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the elements of the array. The function will be called multiple times with t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4) test cases, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
