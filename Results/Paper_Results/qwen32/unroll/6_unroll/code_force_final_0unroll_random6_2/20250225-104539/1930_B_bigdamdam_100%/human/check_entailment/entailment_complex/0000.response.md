### Reasoning:
The given program aims to generate a permutation `p` of length `n` for each test case such that there do not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) such that `p[i]` divides `p[j]` and `p[i+1]` divides `p[j+1]`.

The program's approach is to fill the even indices of the permutation with decreasing values starting from `n` and the odd indices with increasing values starting from `1 + n % 2`. This strategy avoids the condition where `p[i]` divides `p[j]` and `p[i+1]` divides `p[j+1]` by ensuring that the values at consecutive indices do not have a simple divisibility relationship.

Let's break down the logic:
1. **Even Indices (0, 2, 4, ...)**: Filled with decreasing values starting from `n`. This means the largest numbers are placed at the even indices.
2. **Odd Indices (1, 3, 5, ...)**: Filled with increasing values starting from `1 + n % 2`. This means the smallest numbers (or the smallest odd number if `n` is even) are placed at the odd indices.

By interleaving the largest and smallest numbers in this manner, the program ensures that no two consecutive elements in the permutation have a simple divisibility relationship that would violate the problem's constraints.

### Verification with Example:
For `n = 4`:
- Even indices: 4, 2
- Odd indices: 1, 3
- Resulting permutation: [4, 1, 2, 3]

For `n = 3`:
- Even indices: 3
- Odd indices: 1, 2
- Resulting permutation: [3, 1, 2] or [3, 2, 1] (both valid)

The program correctly generates permutations that satisfy the given constraints for the provided examples.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic and implementation correctly generate the required permutations for each test case without violating the problem's constraints.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
