Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10³) — the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10⁵) — the length of the permutation p. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10⁵.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
    p = [0] * n
    ind = n
    for i in range(0, n, 2):
        p[i] = ind
        ind -= 2
    ind = 1 + n % 2
    for i in range(1, n, 2):
        p[i] = ind
        ind += 2
    print(*p)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
