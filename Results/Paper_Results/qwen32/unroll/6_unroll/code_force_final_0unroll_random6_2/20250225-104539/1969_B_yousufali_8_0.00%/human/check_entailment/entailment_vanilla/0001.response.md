Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves cyclically shifting substrings of a binary string to sort it in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s followed by all 1s). The goal is to find the minimum total cost of these operations, where the cost of shifting a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.

### Key Observations:
1. The optimal strategy involves moving all 1s to the end of the string. This can be achieved by repeatedly moving the first 1 encountered after a 0 to the end of the substring starting from the first 1.
2. The cost to move a 1 that is preceded by `n` zeros is `n + 1` because we need to cyclically shift the substring that includes the 1 and all preceding zeros.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of two functions:
- `func_1()`: This function reads a binary string, counts the number of 1s encountered (`n`), and calculates the cost to move each 1 to the end of the string.
- `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case using `func_1()`.

#### Issues with `func_1()`:
1. **Input Reading**: The function `func_1()` reads the input as a list of integers using `input().split()`. However, the problem specifies that the input is a binary string, not a list of integers. This will cause incorrect parsing.
2. **Logic for Cost Calculation**: The logic for calculating the cost is correct given the correct input parsing. It correctly calculates the cost to move each 1 to the end of the string.

### Corrected Input Reading:
To fix the input reading issue, we need to read the binary string as a string and then convert each character to an integer.

### Correct Program:
Here is the corrected version of `func_1()`:

```python
def func_1():
    s = input().strip()  # Read the binary string
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':  # Check if the character is '1'
            n += 1
        elif n != 0:  # If the character is '0' and there are preceding '1's
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the incorrect input parsing in `func_1()`. The logic for calculating the cost is correct, but the input should be read as a string and then processed accordingly.

Correctness: **False**
