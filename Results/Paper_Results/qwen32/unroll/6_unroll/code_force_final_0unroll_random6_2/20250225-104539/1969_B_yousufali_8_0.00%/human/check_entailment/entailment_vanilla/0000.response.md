Let's carefully analyze the given program in the context of the problem statement.

The task is to determine the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of a cyclic shift operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. The function `func_1` is supposed to handle a single binary string, and `func_2` is supposed to handle multiple test cases.

### Analysis of `func_1`

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` expects the input to be a single line of space-separated integers, which is not consistent with the problem description. The problem states that the input is a binary string, not a list of space-separated integers.
2. **Logic**: The function iterates over the string and counts the number of `1`s encountered (`n`). Whenever it encounters a `0` after encountering at least one `1`, it adds `n + 1` to the total cost (`ans`). This logic is incorrect for the problem at hand. The cost calculation does not accurately reflect the minimum cost to sort the string using cyclic shifts.

### Analysis of `func_2`

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then calls `func_1` for each test case.
2. **Logic**: Since `func_1` is incorrect, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results.

### Correctness

Given the issues with input handling and logic in `func_1`, the program as a whole is incorrect. The program does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary strings as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: False**
