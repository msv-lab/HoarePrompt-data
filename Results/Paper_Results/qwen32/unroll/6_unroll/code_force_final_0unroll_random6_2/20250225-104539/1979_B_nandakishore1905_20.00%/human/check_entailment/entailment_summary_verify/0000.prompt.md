You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        k = abs(n - m)
        if k & k - 1 == 0:
            print(k)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 != 0:
            print(1)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
            print(2)
        else:
            l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            print(k - q)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two distinct non-negative integers `x` and `y`. For each pair, it calculates the absolute difference `k` between `x` and `y` and prints a value based on specific conditions: if `k` is a power of two, it prints `k`; if `x` is 0 and `y` is odd, it prints 1; if `x` is 0 and `y` is even, it prints 2; otherwise, it prints the difference between `k` and the largest power of two less than or equal to `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze it step by step according to the problem description and the provided examples.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We are given two distinct non-negative integers \( x \) and \( y \).
- Two infinite sequences \( a \) and \( b \) are defined as:
  - \( a_n = n \oplus x \)
  - \( b_n = n \oplus y \)
- The task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment of sequences \( a \) and \( b \).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the absolute difference \( k = |x - y| \) and then using bitwise operations to determine the length of the longest common subsegment.

Here's the key logic in the program:
1. If \( k \) is a power of 2 (i.e., \( k \& (k - 1) == 0 \)), it prints \( k \).
2. If \( x = 0 \) and \( y \) is odd, it prints 1.
3. If \( x = 0 \) and \( y \) is even, it prints 2.
4. Otherwise, it calculates the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \) and prints \( k - \) that power of 2.

### Evaluation:
Let's consider some edge cases and examples to check if the program works correctly:

1. **Example 1: \( x = 0 \), \( y = 1 \)**
   - \( k = |0 - 1| = 1 \)
   - Since \( k \) is a power of 2, the program prints \( 1 \), which is correct.

2. **Example 2: \( x = 12 \), \( y = 4 \)**
   - \( k = |12 - 4| = 8 \)
   - Since \( k \) is a power of 2, the program prints \( 8 \), which is correct.

3. **Example 3: \( x = 57 \), \( y = 37 \)**
   - \( k = |57 - 37| = 20 \)
   - \( k \) is not a power of 2.
   - The binary representation of \( k \) is `10100`.
   - The highest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \) is \( 16 \).
   - The program prints \( 20 - 16 = 4 \), which is correct.

4. **Example 4: \( x = 316560849 \), \( y = 14570961 \)**
   - \( k = |316560849 - 14570961| = 302019888 \)
   - \( k \) is not a power of 2.
   - The binary representation of \( k \) is `10010001101011100110011001000000`.
   - The highest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \) is \( 268435456 \).
   - The program prints \( 302019888 - 268435456 = 335844432 \), which is incorrect. The correct answer should be \( 33554432 \).

From the analysis of Example 4, we can see that the program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it incorrectly calculates the longest common subsegment length for the given inputs.

### Conclusion:
The program fails for at least one input case, so it is not correct.

Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program incorrectly calculates the length of the longest common subsegment for certain inputs, such as \( x = 316560849 \) and \( y = 14570961 \).
