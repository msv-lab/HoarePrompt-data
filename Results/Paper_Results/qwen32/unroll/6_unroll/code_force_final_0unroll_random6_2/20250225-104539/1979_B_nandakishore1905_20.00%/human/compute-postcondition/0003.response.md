Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two distinct non-negative integers `x` and `y`. For each pair, it calculates the absolute difference `k` between `x` and `y` and prints a value based on specific conditions: if `k` is a power of two, it prints `k`; if `x` is 0 and `y` is odd, it prints 1; if `x` is 0 and `y` is even, it prints 2; otherwise, it prints the difference between `k` and the largest power of two less than or equal to `k`.**
