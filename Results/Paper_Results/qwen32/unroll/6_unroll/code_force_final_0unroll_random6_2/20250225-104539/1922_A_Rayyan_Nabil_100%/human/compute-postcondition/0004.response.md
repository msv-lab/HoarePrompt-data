To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for result in results:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `result`, and it iterates over the `results` list. Therefore, the state of `results` is the only thing we can adjust to ensure the loop executes.

For the loop to execute, the `results` list must contain at least one element. The state of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not directly relevant to the execution of this loop, as they are not mentioned in the loop head.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is the integer value from the last iteration, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the strings from the last iteration, and `results` is a list containing at least one element**.
