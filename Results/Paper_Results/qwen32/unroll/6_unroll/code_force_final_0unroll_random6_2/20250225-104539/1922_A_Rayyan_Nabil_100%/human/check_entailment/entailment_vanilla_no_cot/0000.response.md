Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine if there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. The function `func_1` checks if there is at least one position `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. However, this is not sufficient to ensure that `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not match it.

Here is a more detailed explanation:
- For `a` and `b` to match a template, at each position `i`, either `a[i]` and `b[i]` must both be equal to the lowercase version of the template character, or both must be different from the lowercase version of the template character.
- For `c` not to match the template, at least one position `i` must exist where `c[i]` is equal to the lowercase version of the template character if the template character is lowercase, or `c[i]` is the same as the lowercase version of the template character if the template character is uppercase.

The current implementation only checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]` for at least one position, which is not a sufficient condition to guarantee that a valid template exists.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        # Check if we can make a template character that works for a and b but not for c
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            # If a[i] == b[i], then the template character must be uppercase (different from a[i])
            # Check if c[i] is the same as a[i]
            if c[i] == a[i]:
                return 'NO'
        else:
            # If a[i] != b[i], then the template character must be lowercase (same as a[i] or b[i])
            # Check if c[i] is different from both a[i] and b[i]
            if c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
                return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

This corrected function ensures that for each position, we can construct a template character that matches `a` and `b` but does not match `c`.
