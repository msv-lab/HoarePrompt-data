You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` checks if there is any position `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. However, this is not sufficient to determine if there exists a valid template `t` such that both `a` and `b` match `t` while `c` does not match `t`.

The correct approach should be to check if for each position `i`, either:
1. `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and different from `c[i]` (which would mean the template character at `i` is the uppercase version of `a[i]`/`b[i]`).
2. `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different (which would mean the template character at `i` can be chosen as the uppercase version of either `a[i]` or `b[i]`).

If for every position `i` at least one of the above conditions holds, then it is possible to construct such a template `t`.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            if a[i] == c[i]:
                return 'NO'
        else:
            if a[i] == c[i] and b[i] == c[i]:
                return 'NO'
    return 'YES'

def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

The original program fails in cases where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different but both are the same as `c[i]`, which would mean no valid template exists for that position. For example:

Input:
```
1
1
a
a
a
```
Expected Output:
```
NO
```
Actual Output of the given program:
```
YES
```

This is because the original program only checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, but it does not handle the case where they are the same as `c[i]` when they are different from each other.
