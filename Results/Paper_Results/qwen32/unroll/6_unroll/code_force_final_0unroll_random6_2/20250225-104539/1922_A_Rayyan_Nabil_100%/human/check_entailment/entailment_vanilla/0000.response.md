Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to determine if there exists a template string `t` such that:
- Both strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
- String `c` does not match the template `t`.

### Template Matching Conditions
For each position `i` in the strings:
- If the `i-th` character of `t` is lowercase, the `i-th` character of `a` and `b` must be the same as the `i-th` character of `t`.
- If the `i-th` character of `t` is uppercase, the `i-th` character of `a` and `b` must be different from the lowercase version of the `i-th` character of `t`.
- String `c` must not satisfy these conditions for at least one position `i`.

### Program Analysis
The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(n, a, b, c)`: This function checks if there exists at least one position `i` where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If such a position exists, it returns 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Correctness Evaluation
Let's consider the logic in `func_1`:
- The function checks if there is any position `i` where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both different from `c[i]`.
- If such a position exists, it means we can construct a template `t` where `t[i]` is uppercase (since `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`), making `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not.
- If no such position exists, it means that for every position `i`, either `a[i]` or `b[i]` (or both) are the same as `c[i]`, making it impossible to construct a template `t` where `a` and `b` match while `c` does not.

### Conclusion
The logic in `func_1` correctly determines whether there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
