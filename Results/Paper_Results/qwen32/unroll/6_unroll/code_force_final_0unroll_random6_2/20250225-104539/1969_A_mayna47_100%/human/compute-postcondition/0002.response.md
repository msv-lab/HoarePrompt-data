The code snippet `v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))` takes the input, splits it into a list of integers, and then prepends a `0` to this list. This means that the initial list `v` of `n + 1` zeros is replaced by a new list that starts with `0` followed by the integers from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i`; `v` is a list where the first element is `0` and the subsequent elements are the integers provided in the input.**
