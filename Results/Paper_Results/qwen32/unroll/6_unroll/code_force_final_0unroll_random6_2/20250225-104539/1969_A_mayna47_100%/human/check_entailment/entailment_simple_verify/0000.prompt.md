You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))

        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i.

        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i`; `v` is a list where the first element is `0` and the subsequent elements are the integers provided in the input.
    print(3)
    #This is printed: 3



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap
Monocarp wants to throw a party and needs at least 2 friends to attend. Each friend `i` has a best friend `p_i`, and `p_i` is distinct and not equal to `i`. A friend `i` will attend the party if both `i` and `p_i` receive invitations.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it:
1. Reads the number of friends `n`.
2. Reads the list of best friends `p`.
3. Checks if there is any pair of friends `(i, p_i)` such that `p[p_i] == i`. If such a pair exists, it prints `2` because inviting both friends in the pair ensures they both attend.
4. If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

### Potential Issues
The program assumes that if no such pair `(i, p_i)` exists where `p[p_i] == i`, then the minimum number of invitations required is `3`. However, this assumption is incorrect. There could be configurations where fewer than 3 invitations are needed.

### Counterexample
Consider the following test case:
```
1
4
2 3 4 1
```
In this case, the best friend relationships are:
- Friend 1's best friend is Friend 2
- Friend 2's best friend is Friend 3
- Friend 3's best friend is Friend 4
- Friend 4's best friend is Friend 1

Here, there is no pair `(i, p_i)` such that `p[p_i] == i`. However, Monocarp can invite Friends 1 and 2, and both will attend because:
- Friend 1 and Friend 2 are invited.
- Friend 2 and Friend 3 are invited.

Thus, only 2 invitations are needed, not 3.

### Conclusion
The program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible configurations of best friend relationships correctly.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The program incorrectly assumes that if no pair `(i, p_i)` exists where `p[p_i] == i`, the minimum number of invitations required is 3. This is not always true, as demonstrated by the counterexample provided.
