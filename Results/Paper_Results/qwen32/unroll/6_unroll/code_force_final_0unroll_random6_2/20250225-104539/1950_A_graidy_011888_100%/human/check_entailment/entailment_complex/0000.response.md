### Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither based on the conditions specified in the problem description.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` as an integer.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - It checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. If true, it prints "STAIR".
   - It checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. If true, it prints "PEAK".
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE".

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the appropriate result for each test case based on the conditions.

The program correctly handles the input constraints and provides the expected output for each test case as per the problem description.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
