Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each of the t test cases, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; n is an input integer. The loop has finished executing all n iterations, and for each iteration, it has printed either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the conditions provided. The values of t, a, b, c, and n remain unchanged.**
