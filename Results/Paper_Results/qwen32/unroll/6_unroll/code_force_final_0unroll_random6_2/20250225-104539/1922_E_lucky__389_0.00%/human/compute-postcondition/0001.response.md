The value of `x` is decremented by 1. The values of `t` and `X` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is the input integer minus 1.
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is the input integer minus 1.**
