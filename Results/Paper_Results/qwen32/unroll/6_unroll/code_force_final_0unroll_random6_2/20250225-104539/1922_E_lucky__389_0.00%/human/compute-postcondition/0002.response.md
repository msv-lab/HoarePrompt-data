The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `subseq_lens`. No calculations or modifications are made to the variables `t`, `X`, or `x` in the provided code. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is the input integer minus 1; `subseq_lens` is an empty list.**
