### Reasoning:

The given problem requires determining the number of natural numbers `k` that fit the constraints based on Vasya's position `n` and the number `x` he received during the settling process.

The program's logic is as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.
3. It initializes an empty list `output` to store valid `k` values.
4. It checks two conditions:
   - If `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`, it finds the divisors of `n + x - 2` using `func_1` and checks if `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` for each divisor `s`.
   - If `(n - x) % 2 == 0`, it finds the divisors of `n - x` using `func_1` and checks if `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` for each divisor `s`.
5. It ensures that each valid `k` is unique by converting `output` to a set and then prints the length of this set.

The function `func_1(x)` calculates all divisors of `x` efficiently by iterating up to the square root of `x` and collecting both the divisor and its quotient.

Now, let's analyze the correctness of the program:
- The conditions `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` are correctly used to determine when to check for divisors.
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates all divisors of a number, which is essential for finding possible values of `k`.
- The logic `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` ensures that only valid `k` values are considered.
- The use of a set to store `k` values ensures that duplicates are removed, which is important for counting distinct `k` values.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It efficiently finds all possible values of `k` that fit the constraints and counts them.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
