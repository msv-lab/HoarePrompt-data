Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `x` representing Vasya's position in the line. It returns a list that is the concatenation of two lists: `output2` and `output1`. `output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, in reverse order. `output2` contains the quotient divisors of `x` in the same order as `output1` contains its divisors.**
