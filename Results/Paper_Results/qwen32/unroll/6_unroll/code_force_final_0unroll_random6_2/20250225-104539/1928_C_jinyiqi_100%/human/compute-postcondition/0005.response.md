Output State: **The program returns a list that is the concatenation of `output2` and `output1`. `output2` contains the quotient divisors of `x` in the same order as `output1` contains its divisors. `output1` is a list of all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, but in reverse order.**

In simpler terms, the program returns a list where the first part consists of the quotient divisors of `x` corresponding to the divisors in `output1`, followed by the divisors in `output1` itself, which are the divisors of `x` up to its square root in reverse order.
