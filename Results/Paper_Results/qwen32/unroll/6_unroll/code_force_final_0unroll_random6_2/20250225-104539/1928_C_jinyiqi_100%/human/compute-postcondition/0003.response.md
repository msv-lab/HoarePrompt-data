The loop iterates over all integers from 1 to the square root of `x` (inclusive). For each integer `i` in this range, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `x` (i.e., `x % i == 0`). If `i` is a divisor, it appends `i` to `output1` and the corresponding quotient `x / i` to `output2`. This effectively collects all pairs of divisors of `x` where the first element of the pair is less than or equal to the square root of `x`.

After the loop completes, `output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output2` contains the corresponding quotient divisors. The order of elements in `output2` corresponds to the reverse order of elements in `output1` because for each divisor `i`, `x / i` is also a divisor.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `output1` is a list of all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`; `output2` is a list of the corresponding quotient divisors of `x`.**
