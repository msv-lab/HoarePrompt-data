Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the product of the two numbers `x` and `y` by swapping corresponding digits. The program's logic for swapping digits is flawed and does not consider the optimal way to maximize the product.

The current logic in the function `func_1()` is to swap the digits in the first half to maximize the digits in `a` and minimize the digits in `b`, and vice versa for the second half. This simplistic approach does not guarantee the maximum product, as the optimal strategy involves making decisions based on the overall product rather than just the individual digits.

For example, consider the test case:
```
3516
3982
```
The program will swap the first half digits to get `3916` and `3582`, but this is not optimal. The optimal solution would be `3986` and `3512`, which gives a higher product.

Given the incorrect logic in the function `func_1()`, the program will not always produce the correct output.

Correctness: **False**
