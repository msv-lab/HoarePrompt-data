To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to understand the loop's behavior and the context in which it operates. The provided loop iterates over a list `b` and prints each element of the list without adding a newline after each element.

However, the initial state provided is an integer `4527`, and no list `b` is defined in the initial state. To proceed, let's assume that the list `b` contains the digits of the initial state as its elements. This assumption is necessary to demonstrate the loop's behavior based on the given initial state.

Thus, we can infer:
- `b` should be `[4, 5, 2, 7]` to match the digits in the initial state `4527`.

Now, let's execute the loop with this assumption:

```python
b = [4, 5, 2, 7]
for i in range(len(b)):
    print(b[i], end='')
```

The loop will print each element of the list `b` consecutively without any spaces or newlines between them.

Therefore, the output of the loop will be `4527`.

Output State: **4527**.
