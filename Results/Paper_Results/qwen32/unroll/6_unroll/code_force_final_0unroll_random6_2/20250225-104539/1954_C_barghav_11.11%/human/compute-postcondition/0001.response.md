Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x < 10^100 and 1 <= y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is a list of characters from the input string; `b` is a list of characters from the new input string.**

In simple terms, the value of `b` is now a list of characters from the new input string, while the values of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `a` remain unchanged.
