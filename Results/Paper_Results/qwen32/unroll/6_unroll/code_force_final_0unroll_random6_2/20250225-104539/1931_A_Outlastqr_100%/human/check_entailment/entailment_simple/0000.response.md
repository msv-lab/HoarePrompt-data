Reasoning: 

To determine if the provided program is correct, we need to verify if it correctly generates the lexicographically smallest word of 3 lowercase Latin letters for each encoded integer `n` within the specified range (3 to 78).

Let's analyze the logic of the code:

1. **Alphabet Mapping:** The program uses `string.ascii_lowercase` to map the letters 'a' to 'z' (0-indexed in the string, but we need 1-indexed for the problem).

2. **Logic Breakdown:**
   - **`if n > 52:`** 
     - This condition handles the cases where the sum of the letter positions is large enough to require the third letter to be 'z'.
     - `word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`: This means the first letter is the one corresponding to the position `n - 53` and both the second and third letters are 'z'.
     - This is correct because to get a high `n`, the first letter needs to be a high-value letter, and the remaining sum (after subtracting the positions of 'z' and 'z') should be mapped to the first letter.
   
   - **`elif n > 27:`**
     - This handles cases where the sum is large enough to require the third letter to be 'z', but not large enough to require a high-value first letter.
     - `word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`: Here, the first letter is 'a', the second letter is the one corresponding to the position `n - 28`, and the third letter is 'z'.
     - This is correct because the sum of the positions of 'a' and 'z' is 27, so `n - 28` gives the position of the second letter.
   
   - **`elif n == 27:`**
     - This is a special case where the only combination that sums to 27 is 'a', 'a', and 'y'.
     - `word = 'aay'`: This is correct as 'a' + 'a' + 'y' equals 1 + 1 + 25 = 27.
   
   - **`else:`**
     - This handles the cases where the sum is small enough to be covered by the first two letters being 'a' and the third letter being a low-value letter.
     - `word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`: Here, the first two letters are 'a', and the third letter is the one corresponding to the position `n - 3`.
     - This is correct because the sum of the positions of 'a' and 'a' is 2, so `n - 3` gives the position of the third letter.

3. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For `n = 24`, the smallest word is 'aav' (1 + 1 + 22).
   - For `n = 70`, the smallest word is 'rzz' (18 + 26 + 26).
   - For `n = 3`, the smallest word is 'aaa' (1 + 1 + 1).
   - For `n = 55`, the smallest word is 'czz' (3 + 26 + 26).
   - For `n = 48`, the smallest word is 'auz' (1 + 21 + 26).

The program correctly handles all these cases and generates the lexicographically smallest word for each `n`.

Correctness: **True**
