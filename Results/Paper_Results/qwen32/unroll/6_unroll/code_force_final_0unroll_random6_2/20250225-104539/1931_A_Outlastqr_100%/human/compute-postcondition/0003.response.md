Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t` which is an integer representing the number of test cases (where 1 <= t <= 100), and for each test case, `n` which is an integer representing some value (where 3 <= n <= 78). The function performs operations based on these inputs and returns the result for each test case.**
