Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution to determine its correctness.

The task is to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that can be encoded as a given integer, where each letter is represented by its position in the alphabet (a=1, b=2, ..., z=26).

The provided program uses a set of conditions to determine the word based on the value of `n`. However, these conditions do not cover all possible cases correctly and do not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word for all values of `n`.

### Analysis of the Program:
- **Condition 1:** `if n > 52:` The program adds the letter corresponding to `n - 53` followed by 'zz'. This condition is incorrect because the sum of the positions of any three letters cannot exceed 78 (26 + 26 + 26). Also, it does not ensure the smallest lexicographical word.
  
- **Condition 2:** `elif n > 27:` The program adds 'a' followed by the letter corresponding to `n - 28` and 'z'. This condition is also incorrect for the same reasons as above.
  
- **Condition 3:** `elif n == 27:` The program sets the word to 'aay'. This is correct for `n=27` as 'aay' has a sum of 27 (1+1+25).
  
- **Condition 4:** `else:` The program adds 'aa' followed by the letter corresponding to `n - 3`. This is correct for `n<=26` as it sets the word to the smallest possible word that sums to `n`.

### Correct Approach:
To find the lexicographically smallest word, we need to iterate over possible values for the first letter and then find the smallest possible combination for the remaining two letters that sum up to the required value.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        for a in range(1, 27):
            for b in range(1, 27):
                c = n - a - b
                if 1 <= c <= 26:
                    word = alphabet[a-1] + alphabet[b-1] + alphabet[c-1]
                    break
            if word:
                break
        print(word)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases and does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word for all values of `n`. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
