To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify that it correctly constructs the lexicographically smallest three-letter word for each given encoded integer `n` within the specified range.

Here's a breakdown of the logic used in the program and a comparison with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78).

2. **Word Construction**:
   - The program uses the `string.ascii_lowercase` to map characters to their positions in the alphabet.
   - It constructs the word based on the value of `n`:
     - If `n > 52`, it constructs the word as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
     - If `27 < n ≤ 52`, it constructs the word as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
     - If `n == 27`, it constructs the word as `'aay'`.
     - If `3 ≤ n < 27`, it constructs the word as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

Let's verify these rules against the problem requirements:

- **For `n > 52`**:
  - The first character is `alphabet[n - 53]`, which is correct because `n - 53` will give an index from 0 to 25 (since `n` can be up to 78).
  - The last two characters are `'zz'`, which is the lexicographically largest combination, ensuring the smallest possible first character.

- **For `27 < n ≤ 52`**:
  - The first character is `'a'`, which is the smallest possible character.
  - The second character is `alphabet[n - 28]`, which is correct because `n - 28` will give an index from 0 to 24.
  - The last character is `'z'`, which is the largest possible character, ensuring the smallest possible second character.

- **For `n == 27`**:
  - The word is `'aay'`, which is correct because it is the smallest possible word with a sum of 27.

- **For `3 ≤ n < 27`**:
  - The first two characters are `'aa'`, which are the smallest possible characters.
  - The last character is `alphabet[n - 3]`, which is correct because `n - 3` will give an index from 0 to 23.

The program seems to correctly handle all the cases as described in the problem statement. 

Therefore, the program is correct.

Reasoning: The program correctly constructs the lexicographically smallest three-letter word for each given encoded integer `n` by following the rules specified in the problem statement.
Correctness: **True**
