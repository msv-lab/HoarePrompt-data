### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the annotations to ensure the correctness of the solution.

1. **Case 1: \( n > 52 \)**
   - **Program Logic**: `word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`
   - **Reasoning**: To minimize the word lexicographically, if \( n > 52 \), the program sets the first letter to the smallest possible letter that, when combined with two 'z's (each at position 26), sums to \( n \). For example, if \( n = 78 \), the first letter is at position \( 78 - 52 = 26 \), which is 'z', so the word is 'zzz'. However, for \( n = 53 \), the first letter is at position \( 53 - 52 = 1 \), which is 'a', so the word is 'azz'. This is correct as it minimizes the first letter while keeping the sum \( n \).

2. **Case 2: \( 27 \leq n \leq 52 \)**
   - **Program Logic**: `word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`
   - **Reasoning**: Here, the program sets the first letter to 'a' (position 1) and the last letter to 'z' (position 26), and the middle letter is chosen such that the sum equals \( n \). For example, if \( n = 52 \), the middle letter is at position \( 52 - 27 = 25 \), which is 'y', so the word is 'ayz'. This is correct as it minimizes the word lexicographically by fixing 'a' and 'z'.

3. **Case 3: \( n = 27 \)**
   - **Program Logic**: `word = 'aay'`
   - **Reasoning**: The smallest possible word with a sum of 27 is 'aay' (1 + 1 + 25). This is correct.

4. **Case 4: \( 3 \leq n \leq 26 \)**
   - **Program Logic**: `word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`
   - **Reasoning**: The program sets the first two letters to 'a' (position 1) and the last letter is chosen such that the sum equals \( n \). For example, if \( n = 26 \), the last letter is at position \( 26 - 3 = 23 \), which is 'w', so the word is 'aaw'. This is correct as it minimizes the word lexicographically by fixing 'aa'.

### Testing the Program:
Let's verify with the provided test cases:

1. **Input: 24**
   - Expected output: `'aav'` (1 + 1 + 22)
   - Program output: `'aav'` (Correct)

2. **Input: 70**
   - Expected output: `'rzz'` (18 + 26 + 26)
   - Program output: `'rzz'` (Correct)

3. **Input: 3**
   - Expected output: `'aaa'` (1 + 1 + 1)
   - Program output: `'aaa'` (Correct)

4. **Input: 55**
   - Expected output: `'czz'` (3 + 26 + 26)
   - Program output: `'czz'` (Correct)

5. **Input: 48**
   - Expected output: `'auz'` (1 + 21 + 26)
   - Program output: `'auz'` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases within the given constraints and produces the lexicographically smallest word for each input \( n \).

### Final:
**True**
