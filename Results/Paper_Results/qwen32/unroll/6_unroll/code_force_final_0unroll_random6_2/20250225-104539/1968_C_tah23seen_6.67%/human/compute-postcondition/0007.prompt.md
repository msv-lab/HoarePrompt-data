You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500, and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 representing the number of elements in the array a (where a_2, a_3, ..., a_n are the elements of arr). The function is called for each test case, and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \); `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \); `ans` is a list where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and each subsequent `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]` and is calculated by adding `ans[i]` to `arr[i]` and possibly more multiples of `ans[i]` if necessary.
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, each `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]` and calculated by adding `ans[i]` to `arr[i + 1]` and possibly more multiples of `ans[i]`, and `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `arr` of integers where each integer is between 1 and 500, and an integer `n` representing the number of elements in the list `arr`. The function returns a list `ans` where the first element `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and each subsequent element `ans[i + 1]` is calculated by adding `ans[i]` to `arr[i + 1]` and possibly more multiples of `ans[i]` to ensure it is greater than `arr[i + 1]`. The last element `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `ans` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, each `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]` and calculated by adding `ans[i]` to `arr[i + 1]` and possibly more multiples of `ans[i]`, and `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
