The code snippet assigns `ans[0]` the value of `arr[0] + 1`. Given that `arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \), `arr[0]` will be an integer within this range. Therefore, `ans[0]` will be `arr[0] + 1`, which will be an integer in the range \( 2 \leq ans[0] \leq 501 \). The value of `n` and the remaining elements of `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \); `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \); `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[0]` which is `arr[0] + 1`.**
