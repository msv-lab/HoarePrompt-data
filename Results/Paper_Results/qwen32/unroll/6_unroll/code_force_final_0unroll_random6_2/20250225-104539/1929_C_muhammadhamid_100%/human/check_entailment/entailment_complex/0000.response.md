### Reasoning:

The problem revolves around determining whether Sasha can guarantee that he will eventually have at least `n` coins for any integer `n` by placing bets under the given rules of the casino. Specifically, Sasha can only lose up to `x` consecutive times, and if he wins, his bet amount is multiplied by `k`.

The solution provided in the annotated program attempts to calculate a minimum threshold `s` such that if Sasha starts with at least `s` coins, he can guarantee that he will eventually reach any number of coins he desires. The value `s` is calculated by simulating the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` consecutive times and then tries to recover.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Initialization**: The variable `s` is initialized to 1. This represents the starting bet amount.
2. **Simulation of Consecutive Losses**:
   - For each of the `x` consecutive losses, the program calculates the minimum amount of coins Sasha would need to recover from that loss.
   - The formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` is used to update `s` after each simulated loss. This formula is derived from the fact that after a loss, Sasha needs to bet an amount that, when multiplied by `k` after a win, will at least cover his losses and allow him to continue betting.
3. **Comparison**: After calculating the threshold `s`, the program compares it with the initial number of coins `a` that Sasha has. If `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, Sasha can guarantee that he will eventually have any number of coins he desires. Otherwise, he cannot.

### Evaluation of the Program:

The program's logic is based on the assumption that by simulating the worst-case scenario of `x` consecutive losses and calculating the necessary recovery amount, it can determine whether Sasha can guarantee reaching any number of coins. The formula used (`s += s // (k - 1) + 1`) is a correct way to simulate the recovery process after each loss.

The program correctly handles the constraints and input format specified in the problem statement. It processes each test case independently and outputs the correct response ('Yes' or 'No') based on the comparison of the initial number of coins `a` and the calculated threshold `s`.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct and accurately determines whether Sasha can guarantee reaching any number of coins based on the given rules of the casino.

**Correctness: True**
