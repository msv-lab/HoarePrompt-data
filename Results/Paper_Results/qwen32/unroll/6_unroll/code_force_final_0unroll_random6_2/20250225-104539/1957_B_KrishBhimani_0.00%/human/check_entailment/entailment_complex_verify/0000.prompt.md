You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

    #State: For each of the t test cases, the output is a list of n integers where each integer is a power of 2 corresponding to the set bits in the binary representation of k, padded with zeros if necessary to make the list length n.
#Overall this is what the function does:For each of the `t` test cases, the function takes two integers `n` and `k`, and outputs a list of `n` integers. The list contains powers of 2 corresponding to the set bits in the binary representation of `k`, padded with zeros if necessary to ensure the list length is `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. **Construct a sequence** of `n` non-negative integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that:
   - The sum of these integers is `k`.
   - The number of `1`s in the binary representation of `a_1 | a_2 | ... | a_n` (bitwise OR of all elements) is maximized.

2. **Input**:
   - The first line contains a single integer `t` (number of test cases).
   - Each test case contains two integers `n` and `k`.

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output a sequence of `n` integers that satisfies the conditions above.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Reading the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, reading `n` and `k`.
3. Constructing a list `arr` of positions where `k` has a `1` in its binary representation.
4. Creating a new list `ans` by setting each position in `arr` to `1 << i` (which is `2^i`).
5. Filling the remaining positions in `ans` with `0` to ensure the length of `ans` is `n`.
6. Adjusting the last element in `ans` to ensure the sum of `ans` is `k`.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Sum Constraint**: The program ensures the sum of the sequence equals `k`, but the approach to achieve this might not always be optimal.
2. **Maximizing 1s in Bitwise OR**: The program aims to maximize the number of `1`s in the bitwise OR by setting each position where `k` has a `1` to `2^i`. However, it does not ensure that this is the optimal way to maximize the number of `1`s in the bitwise OR.

### Counterexample:
Consider the test case:
```
1
2 5
```
- The binary representation of `5` is `101`.
- The program will set `arr` to `[0, 2]` (since `5` has `1`s at positions `0` and `2`).
- The program will then create `ans` as `[1, 0, 4]` (which is incorrect since `n` is `2`).
- The program will adjust `ans` to `[1, 4]` and then fill the remaining position with `0` to make it `[1, 4, 0]` (which is still incorrect).
- The program will then adjust the last element to ensure the sum is `5`, resulting in `[1, 4]`.
- The bitwise OR of `[1, 4]` is `5` (binary `101`), which has `2` `1`s.

However, a better solution would be `[1, 4]` (which is correct in this case, but the program might not always produce the optimal solution).

### Correctness:
The program does not always produce the optimal solution that maximizes the number of `1`s in the bitwise OR. It might work for some cases but fails to guarantee the optimal solution for all cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not guarantee that the number of `1`s in the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized for all cases. While it might work for some inputs, it does not handle all potential cases optimally.
