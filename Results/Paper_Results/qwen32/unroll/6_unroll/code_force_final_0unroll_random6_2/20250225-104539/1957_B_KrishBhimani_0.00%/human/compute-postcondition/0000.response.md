The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
