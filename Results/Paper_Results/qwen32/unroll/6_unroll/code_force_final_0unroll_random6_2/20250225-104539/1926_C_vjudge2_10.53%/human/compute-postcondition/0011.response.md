The only object in the loop head is the variable `n`, which iterates over the list `numbers`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the list `numbers` must contain at least one integer. The values of `t`, `values`, `sum_values`, and `total` do not directly affect whether the loop can execute, as they are not mentioned in the loop head.

State: **`t` is the integer value of the input representing the number of test cases, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers and must have at least 1 integer, `values` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], `sum_values` is [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 46, 48, 51, 55, 60, 66, 73, 81, 90, 100], `total` is 45**
