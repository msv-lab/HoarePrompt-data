Reasoning:  
The provided program is supposed to compute the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `n` for each test case. However, there are a few issues in the code that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect Loop Range**: The loop `for i in range(10, n + 1):` is incorrect because `n` is not defined in this context. It should be `for i in range(10, max(numbers) + 1):` to ensure that it iterates up to the maximum `n` across all test cases.

2. **Incorrect `sum_values` Calculation**: The `sum_values` array is supposed to store the cumulative sum of the digit sums up to each number. However, the loop that updates `sum_values` uses `sum_total` which is not defined correctly. It should use `sum_values[i] = sum_values[i - 1] + values[i]`.

3. **Incorrect `values` Array Usage**: The `values` array is used to store the digit sum of each number, but it is not correctly utilized in the loop for updating `sum_values`.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        numbers.append(n)
    max_n = max(numbers)
    values = [0 for _ in range(max_n + 1)]
    sum_values = [0 for _ in range(max_n + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        total += i
        sum_values[i] = total
    for i in range(10, max_n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        sum_values[i] = sum_values[i - 1] + values[i]
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])

func_1()
```

With these corrections, the program should correctly compute the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to `n` for each test case. However, the original code provided does not include these fixes, so it is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
