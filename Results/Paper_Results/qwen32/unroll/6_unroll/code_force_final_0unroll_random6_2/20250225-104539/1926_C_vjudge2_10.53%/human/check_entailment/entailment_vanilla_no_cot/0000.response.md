Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Use of `n` in the Loop**: In the loop `for i in range(10, n + 1):`, `n` is not defined in the scope of this loop. It should be `max(numbers)` to ensure it covers all numbers up to the maximum `n` in the test cases.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `sum_values`**: The `sum_values` list is being updated with `sum_total` which is not defined. It should be updated with `sum_values[i - 1] + values[i]`.

3. **Initialization of `values` and `sum_values`**: The `values` and `sum_values` lists are initialized with a size of `max(numbers) + 1`, but this initialization happens before reading all test cases, so `max(numbers)` is not yet known. These lists should be initialized after reading all test cases.

4. **Unnecessary Function Call**: The program starts with `func_1()`, which is redundant and should be removed or the function should be called after defining it.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        numbers.append(n)
    max_n = max(numbers)
    values = [0 for _ in range(max_n + 1)]
    sum_values = [0 for _ in range(max_n + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        total += i
        sum_values[i] = total
    for i in range(10, max_n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        sum_values[i] = sum_values[i - 1] + values[i]
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])

func_1()
```

With these corrections, the program should work as expected.
