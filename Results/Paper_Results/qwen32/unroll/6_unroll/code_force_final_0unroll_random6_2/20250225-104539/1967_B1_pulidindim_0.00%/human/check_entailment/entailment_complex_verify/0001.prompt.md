You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each of the following t lines contains two positive integers n and m such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The sum of all n and the sum of all m across all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.
def func():

        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:

            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: The sequence of integers printed for each test case, where each integer is the final value of `ans` after processing the corresponding pair of `n` and `m`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates and prints an integer value based on a specific algorithm involving `n` and `m`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the corresponding program to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \( 1 \leq a \leq n \)
2. \( 1 \leq b \leq m \)
3. \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the provided program and see if it correctly addresses the problem.

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))
```

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `ans = n`: This initializes the answer with `n`, which is the number of pairs where `b=1`. For `b=1`, the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) simplifies to \(a + 1\) being a multiple of 1, which is always true for any `a`. Hence, there are `n` such pairs.

2. **Loop for `b > 1`**:
   - The loop starts with `count = 2` and goes up to `m`.
   - For each `count` (which represents `b`), it calculates `countmins = count - 1`.
   - It then calculates `g = n / count`.
   - If `g < countmins`, it breaks the loop. This condition seems to be checking if the number of valid `a` values is less than the number of previous `b` values, which doesn't directly relate to the problem's conditions.
   - It then adjusts `g` by subtracting `countmins`.
   - Finally, it increments `ans` by `g / count + 1` and increments `count`.

#### Issues in the Program:
- The logic for counting valid pairs for `b > 1` seems incorrect. The formula `g = n / count` and subsequent adjustments do not directly count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` as per the problem's conditions.
- The program does not correctly implement the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

### Correctness:
Given the analysis, the program does not correctly count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` as per the problem's conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
