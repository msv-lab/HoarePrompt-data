To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand what the loop does for each pair of integers \( n \) and \( m \).

For each test case, the loop initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`. It then enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `count` is less than or equal to `m`. Inside the loop, it calculates `countmins` as `count - 1`, computes `g` as `n / count`, and checks if `g` is less than `countmins`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks. Otherwise, it updates `g` by subtracting `countmins` from it and then adds `g / count + 1` to `ans`. Finally, it increments `count` by 1. After the loop, it prints the integer value of `ans`.

The loop processes each pair of integers \( n \) and \( m \) independently, and the output for each pair is printed sequentially. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` are inputs, and `count` and `ans` are local to each iteration of the outer loop, meaning they do not retain their values between different test cases.

Since the loop processes each test case independently and the variables `t`, `n`, and `m` are not modified within the loop, the output state will simply be the sequence of printed values of `ans` for each test case.

Given the format required, the output state can be described as the sequence of integers printed for each test case. However, since we don't have specific values for `n` and `m`, we can't provide the exact numerical output. Instead, we can describe the output state in a general form:

Output State: **The sequence of integers printed for each test case, where each integer is the final value of `ans` after processing the corresponding pair of `n` and `m`.**
