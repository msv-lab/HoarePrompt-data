### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided program to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \( 1 \leq a \leq n \)
2. \( 1 \leq b \leq m \)
3. \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

This means that \( a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) for some integer \( k \).

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a loop that iterates over possible values of \( b \) (from 2 to \( m \)) and calculates the number of valid \( a \) values for each \( b \). However, the logic within the loop seems flawed and does not correctly implement the problem's conditions.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `ans = n`: This initializes the answer with `n`, which is the number of pairs where \( b = 1 \). For \( b = 1 \), the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) simplifies to \( a + 1 \) being a multiple of 1, which is always true for any \( a \). Hence, there are \( n \) such pairs.

2. **Loop for \( b > 1 \)**:
   - The loop starts with `count = 2` and goes up to `m`.
   - For each `count` (which represents \( b \)), it calculates `countmins = count - 1`.
   - It then calculates `g = n / count`.
   - If `g < countmins`, it breaks the loop. This condition seems to be checking if the number of valid \( a \) values is less than the number of previous \( b \) values, which doesn't directly relate to the problem's conditions.
   - It then adjusts `g` by subtracting `countmins`.
   - Finally, it increments `ans` by `g / count + 1` and increments `count`.

The logic for counting valid pairs for \( b > 1 \) seems incorrect. The formula `g = n / count` and subsequent adjustments do not directly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as per the problem's conditions. The program does not correctly implement the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

#### Correct Implementation:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) holds. Here's a correct implementation:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This implementation correctly counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) by iterating over all possible pairs and checking the condition.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as per the problem's conditions. Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
