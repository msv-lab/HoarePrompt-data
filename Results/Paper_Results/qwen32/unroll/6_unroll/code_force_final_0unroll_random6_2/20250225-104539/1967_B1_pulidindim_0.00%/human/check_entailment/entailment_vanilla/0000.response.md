Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem but seems to have several issues in its logic and implementation. Let's break it down:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `count = 2`: This variable is used to iterate over possible values of `b`.
   - `ans = n`: This variable is initialized to `n`, implying that all pairs (a, 1) are counted initially. This is correct because for any `a` from 1 to `n`, \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1) = 1\).

2. **Loop for `b`:**
   - The loop `while count <= m:` iterates over possible values of `b` starting from 2 up to `m`.
   - `countmins = count - 1`: This seems to be an attempt to count the number of valid `a` values for each `b`. However, the logic here is flawed.
   - `g = n / count`: This calculation is not clear and does not seem to align with the problem's requirement.
   - `if g < countmins: break`: This condition is not logically sound for determining the number of valid pairs.
   - `g -= countmins`: This operation does not make sense in the context of the problem.
   - `ans += g / count + 1`: This operation also does not align with the problem's requirement and seems to be an incorrect way of counting valid pairs.
   - `count += 1`: This correctly increments `b` for the next iteration.

3. **Output:**
   - `print(int(ans))`: The final count of valid pairs is printed as an integer.

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic for counting valid pairs `(a, b)` is incorrect. The program does not properly implement the condition that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The initialization of `ans` to `n` is correct but the subsequent logic for counting pairs for `b > 1` is flawed.
- The program does not correctly handle the GCD calculation or the condition check for each pair `(a, b)`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the program's logic and implementation, it does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

**Correctness: False**
