You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
    if order == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Annotated Code: 
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers with length n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and num2 is an integer representing the length of the list a (i.e., num2 == n).
def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
        
    #State: `a` is a list of integers with length `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `num2` is an integer representing the length of the list `a` (i.e., `num2` == `n`), and `order` is the count of non-increasing consecutive pairs in the list `a`.
    if (order == 0) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` checks if the list `a` of integers is strictly increasing. It returns `True` if the list is strictly increasing, and `False` otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains a logical error in its approach to determining the maximum beauty of the array. The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order and returns `True` if it is, which leads to the incorrect conclusion that the beauty of the array is `0`. However, the goal is to maximize the beauty, which can be achieved by arranging the elements in a way that maximizes the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

The correct approach to maximize the beauty is to sort the array and then calculate the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. The provided program does this correctly when `func_1` returns `False`, but it incorrectly returns `0` when the array is already sorted, which is not necessarily the case with maximum beauty.

For example, consider the input:
```
2
2
1 2
2
2 1
```
The expected output should be:
```
1
1
```
However, the current program will output `0` for the first test case because the array `[1, 2]` is already sorted, and `func_1` returns `True`.

To fix this, the check for whether the array is sorted should be removed, and the beauty should always be calculated based on the sorted array. Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    beauty = 0
    b = sorted(a)
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
    print(beauty)
```

This corrected version will always compute the maximum beauty by sorting the array and summing the differences between consecutive elements.
