### Reasoning:

The original assessment is **incorrect**. Let's analyze the program step-by-step to understand why.

1. **Function `func_1` Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the list `a` is strictly increasing. It returns `True` if the list is strictly increasing, and `False` otherwise.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements.
   - It then checks if the array is strictly increasing using `func_1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `True` (indicating the array is strictly increasing), it prints `0`.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

3. **Issue in the Program**:
   - The program incorrectly assumes that if the array is strictly increasing, its beauty is `0`. This is not true.
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty, which is achieved by sorting the array and then calculating the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - The check for whether the array is strictly increasing (`func_1`) is unnecessary and leads to incorrect results when the array is already sorted in a way that maximizes beauty.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The beauty of the array can be maximized by always sorting the array and then calculating the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - The check performed by `func_1` should be removed, and the beauty should be calculated based on the sorted array regardless of its initial order.

5. **Final Evaluation**:
   - The original assessment is correct in identifying the logical error in the program.
   - The program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty for all cases, especially when the array is already sorted in a way that maximizes beauty.

### Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the unnecessary check performed by `func_1`, which leads to incorrect results when the array is already sorted in a way that maximizes beauty. The program should always sort the array and calculate the beauty based on the sorted array.
