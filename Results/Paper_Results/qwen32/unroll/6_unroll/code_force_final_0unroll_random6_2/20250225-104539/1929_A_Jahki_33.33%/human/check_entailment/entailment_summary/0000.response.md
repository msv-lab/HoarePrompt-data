Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to find the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, the program sorts the array in ascending order and calculates the beauty based on this sorted array.

The function `func_1` checks if the array is already strictly increasing. If it is, the beauty is 0 because no rearrangement can increase the beauty further. However, this check is unnecessary for finding the maximum beauty. The maximum beauty is always obtained by sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the beauty, regardless of the initial order of the array.

The program correctly sorts the array and calculates the beauty by iterating through the sorted array and summing the differences between consecutive elements. This approach ensures that the beauty is maximized.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
