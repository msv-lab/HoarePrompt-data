Reasoning:  
The given program is intended to find the maximum beauty of an array after rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the array, i.e., \((a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1})\).

Here's the breakdown of the program:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements.
3. It checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `func_1` function.
4. If the array is already sorted, it prints `0` because the beauty of a sorted array is `0`.
5. If the array is not sorted, it sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
6. It prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

The logic of the program is correct. Sorting the array in non-decreasing order will indeed maximize the beauty because the differences between consecutive elements will be maximized in this order.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The `func_1` function is used to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and if so, it returns `True`, but the program incorrectly prints `0` when `func_1` returns `True`. This is correct because the beauty of a sorted array is indeed `0`. But the logic in the `else` block is also correct as it calculates the beauty of the sorted array. The program does not have any other logical errors.

Thus, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and examples.

Correctness: **True**
