You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

    #State: The output state consists of t lines, each representing the result of the corresponding test case. For each test case, the output is the maximum number of elements that can be removed from the list a such that the first and last elements of the remaining list are not the same consecutive elements. The value of t, n, and the list a remain unchanged from the initial state.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by identifying the longest contiguous segments from the start and end of the array that contain the same elements and then calculating the minimum burles needed based on the middle segment. However, this approach does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when there are multiple distinct elements in the middle segment that require more than one operation to make the entire array uniform.

Let's consider a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```
Explanation for the expected output:
The optimal operation would be to set the middle three elements to the same value, for example, changing the array to `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` or `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`. This would cost 3 burles, but we can achieve the same by setting the first and last elements to the middle value, for example, changing the array to `[2, 2, 3, 2, 2]` and then to `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`. This would cost 2 burles in total.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
3
```
Explanation for the actual output:
The program calculates the longest contiguous segments from the start and end that are uniform, which in this case are `[1]` from the start and `[1]` from the end. It then calculates the cost as `5 - 1 - 1 = 3`, which is incorrect.

This demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle cases where the optimal solution involves more complex segment operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
