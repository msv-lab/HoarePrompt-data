Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. The logic implemented is too simplistic and does not consider all possible scenarios for the optimal solution. 

The program attempts to find the longest prefix and suffix of the array that are the same and then calculates the cost based on that, but it does not account for the possibility of the optimal solution involving changing a segment in the middle of the array. 

For example, consider the test case:

```
3
1 2 3
```

The correct output should be `2` because you can change the array to `[1, 1, 1]` or `[3, 3, 3]` in 2 burles. However, the provided program will output `1`, which is incorrect.

The problem requires a more sophisticated approach, possibly involving dynamic programming or a greedy strategy to find the optimal segment to change.
