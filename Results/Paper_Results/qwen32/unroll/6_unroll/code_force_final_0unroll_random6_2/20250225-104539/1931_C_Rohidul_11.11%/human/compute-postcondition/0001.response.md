Output State: **The output state consists of t lines, each representing the result of the corresponding test case. For each test case, the output is the maximum number of elements that can be removed from the list a such that the first and last elements of the remaining list are not the same consecutive elements. The value of t, n, and the list a remain unchanged from the initial state.**
