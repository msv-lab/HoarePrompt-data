The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of elements that can be removed from the list such that the first and last elements of the remaining list are not the same consecutive elements. The input values for the number of test cases, the size of each list, and the list elements themselves remain unchanged after the function executes.
