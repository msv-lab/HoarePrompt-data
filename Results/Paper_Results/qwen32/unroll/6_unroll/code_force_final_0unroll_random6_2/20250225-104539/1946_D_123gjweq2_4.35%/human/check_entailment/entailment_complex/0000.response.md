### Reasoning:

The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem described. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function `func_1` Misinterpretation:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to find the maximum number `k` such that the bitwise OR of the XORs of segments of the array `arr` is less than or equal to `x`. However, the current implementation of `func_1` simply calls `find_max(arr, 31)` and ignores the `x` parameter. This is incorrect because the function should consider `x` to determine the valid segments.

2. **Function `find_max` Misinterpretation:**
   - The function `find_max` is intended to recursively determine the maximum number of segments based on the bit conditions. However, the implementation does not correctly handle the bitwise OR condition. It attempts to filter segments based on the bit-th bit of XOR but does not correctly use the `x` parameter to ensure that the bitwise OR of the XORs of the segments is less than or equal to `x`.

3. **Bitwise OR Condition:**
   - The problem requires that the bitwise OR of the XORs of the segments is less than or equal to `x`. The current implementation does not correctly accumulate and check this condition. Instead, it only checks individual bits and segments without considering the cumulative OR condition.

4. **Test Cases:**
   - The provided test cases in the problem description show that the correct implementation should handle various scenarios, including cases where the array cannot be split into valid segments. The current implementation does not handle these cases correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `find_max` do not correctly handle the bitwise OR and XOR conditions required by the problem.

**Correctness: False**
