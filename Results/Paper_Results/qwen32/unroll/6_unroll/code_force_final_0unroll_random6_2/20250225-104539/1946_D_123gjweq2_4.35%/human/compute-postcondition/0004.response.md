The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `xor`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the `cur_arr` remains a list of non-negative integers, `bit` remains an integer such that `0 <= bit < 30` and `bit` is not equal to `-1`, and `new_arr` remains an empty list.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30 and `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is 0.**
