The given initial state indicates that `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers and `bit` is an integer with the range 0 <= bit < 30. However, the current value of `bit` is -1, which is outside the specified range. Despite this discrepancy, the provided code snippet only involves `cur_arr` and returns its length.

Output State: **The program returns the length of the list `cur_arr`**.
