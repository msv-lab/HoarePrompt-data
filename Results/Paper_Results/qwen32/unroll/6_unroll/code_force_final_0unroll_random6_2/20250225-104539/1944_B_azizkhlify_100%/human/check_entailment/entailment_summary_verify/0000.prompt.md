You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and an array `a` of `2n` integers where each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice. For each test case, it prints `k` pairs of numbers from the first half of the array, followed by up to `k` individual numbers from the first half if needed, and finally pairs from the second half if the counts do not match. The output is formatted such that pairs are printed first, followed by individual numbers, and then additional pairs from the second half if necessary.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as required by the problem description. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the bitwise XOR of elements of `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of `r`. The logic for constructing the arrays `l` and `r` does not guarantee that the XOR condition is met, and it may output incorrect results for certain inputs.

Let's analyze the provided program and identify a potential issue:

1. The program initializes two arrays `l` and `r` to count occurrences of each number in the first and second halves of the input array `a`, respectively.
2. It then constructs `l` by adding pairs of numbers that appear exactly twice in the first half of `a`.
3. If `l` does not contain `2k` elements yet, it adds single occurrences of numbers from the first half of `a`.
4. It then constructs `r` by adding pairs of numbers that appear exactly twice in the second half of `a` until the number of elements in `r` matches the number of elements in `l`.

The main issue is that the program does not ensure that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`. It simply constructs `l` and `r` based on the counts of numbers without considering the XOR condition.

Here is an example where the program might fail:

**Input:**
```
1
4 1
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
Two lines where the bitwise XOR of the elements in the first line is equal to the bitwise XOR of the elements in the second line. For example:
```
1 2
1 2
```
or
```
3 4
3 4
```
or
```
1 3
2 4
```

**Actual Output:**
The program might output something like:
```
1 2
1 2
```
which is correct, but it might also output something like:
```
1 2
3 4
```
which is incorrect because `1 ^ 2 != 3 ^ 4`.

To ensure the XOR condition is met, the program needs to be modified to explicitly check and maintain the XOR condition while constructing `l` and `r`. The current implementation does not guarantee this condition, making it incorrect for some inputs.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
