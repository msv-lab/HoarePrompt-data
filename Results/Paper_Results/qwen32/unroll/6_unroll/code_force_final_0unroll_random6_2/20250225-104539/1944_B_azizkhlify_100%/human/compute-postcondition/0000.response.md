The given for loop is controlled by the range of an integer input, which is converted to an integer using `int(input())`. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable, meaning it is not used within the loop body. The loop will execute based on the value provided by the input.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure the input to `int(input())` is a positive integer. Since the loop iterates `_` times, the number of iterations will be equal to the integer provided by the input.

Given the task, the only state we can adjust is the input value, which determines how many times the loop will execute. There are no other variables in the loop head that need adjustment.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **The input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer.**

Since the problem specifies that each test case contains an integer `n` and `k`, and the loop runs based on the input provided, we can refine the state to reflect that the input should be a positive integer representing the number of iterations, which in this context is the number of test cases.

State: **The input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer representing the number of test cases, i.e., the number of iterations for the loop.**

This ensures that the loop will execute the correct number of times based on the number of test cases provided.
