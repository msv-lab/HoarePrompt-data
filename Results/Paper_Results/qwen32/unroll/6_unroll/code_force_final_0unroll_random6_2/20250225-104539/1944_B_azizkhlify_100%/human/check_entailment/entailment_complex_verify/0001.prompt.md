You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    #State: The output state consists of numbers printed in the specified format, with pairs printed first from the first half of the array, followed by individual numbers from the first half if needed, and finally pairs from the second half if the counts do not match.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and an array `a` of `2n` integers where each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice. For each test case, it prints `k` pairs of numbers from the first half of the array, followed by up to `k` individual numbers from the first half if needed, and finally pairs from the second half if the counts do not match. The output is formatted such that pairs are printed first, followed by individual numbers, and then additional pairs from the second half if necessary.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap
The problem requires us to find two arrays `l` and `r` each of length `2k` such that:
1. `l` is a subset of the first `n` elements of the array `a`.
2. `r` is a subset of the last `n` elements of the array `a`.
3. The bitwise XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then the array `a` of length `2n`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `l` and `r` are initialized as arrays of zeros with length `n`. However, these arrays are not used effectively in the program.
   - `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are initialized to `0`.
   - `res` is initialized as an empty list.

3. **Counting Elements:**
   - The program counts occurrences of each number in the first `n` elements of `a` and stores them in `l`.
   - Similarly, it counts occurrences of each number in the last `n` elements of `a` and stores them in `r`. However, the second loop for counting `r` is not used effectively.

4. **Building `l`:**
   - The program then iterates over the first `n` elements of `a`.
   - If an element appears twice in the first `n` elements, it is added twice to `l` and its count is reset to `0`.
   - This process continues until `l` has `2k` elements.

5. **Building `r`:**
   - If `l` still needs more elements to reach `2k` elements, the program adds elements that appear only once in the first `n` elements of `a`.
   - The program then prints the elements of `l` and stores the remaining elements in `res` if needed.

6. **Printing `r`:**
   - The program prints the elements in `res` (which were added to `l` if `l` needed more elements).
   - It then iterates over the last `n` elements of `a` and adds elements that appear twice to `r` until `r` has `2k` elements.
   - The program prints the elements of `r`.

### Issues and Corrections

1. **Ineffective Use of `l` and `r` Arrays:**
   - The `l` and `r` arrays are initialized but not used effectively. Instead, the program uses a list `res` to store elements that are added to `l` if `l` needs more elements.
   - The logic for building `r` is flawed because it prints elements from the last `n` elements of `a` without considering if they match the XOR requirement.

2. **XOR Requirement Violation:**
   - The program does not ensure that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`.
   - It simply tries to fill `l` and `r` with elements that appear twice or once, without checking the XOR condition.

### Conclusion
The given program does not ensure that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
