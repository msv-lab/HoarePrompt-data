Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective**: Determine the final score of the game, which is the MEX of the array `c` after all elements from array `a` are moved to `c` according to the rules of the game.
- **Game Rules**:
  - Alice and Bob take turns.
  - Alice starts by picking an element from `a`, adding it to `c`, and removing it from `a`.
  - Bob then picks an element from `a` and removes it from `a`.
  - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, and Bob wants to minimize it.
- **MEX Definition**: The smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an array `a` of size `n`. It uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each element in `a`.

#### Key Steps in the Program:
1. **Count Elements**: `mpp = Counter(arr)` counts the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
2. **Determine MEX**:
   - Iterate through integers from `0` to `n-1`.
   - If an integer `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop (indicating that `i` is the MEX).
   - If an integer `i` appears exactly once and `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
   - If an integer `i` appears exactly once, it sets `first` to `True`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The program does not correctly determine the MEX based on the game rules. It does not simulate the game process where elements are alternately added to `c` by Alice and Bob.
- **Logic Flaw**: The logic for determining when to print the MEX is flawed. The program does not account for the alternating moves and the strategies of Alice and Bob.
- **Suboptimal Strategy**: The program does not consider the optimal strategies of both players. Alice should aim to maximize the MEX, while Bob should aim to minimize it.

### Correct Approach:
- **Simulate the Game**: The program should simulate the game by alternating turns between Alice and Bob.
- **Track Elements in `c`**: Maintain a list or set `c` to track elements added by Alice.
- **Determine MEX**: After all elements are moved, determine the MEX of `c`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly simulate the game and does not determine the MEX based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
