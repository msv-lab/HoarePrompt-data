Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the optimal game score for each test case based on the rules provided. Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Optimal Strategy**: The program does not simulate the optimal moves for Alice and Bob. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it. The program simply checks for the first missing non-negative integer in the array without considering the turns and the strategic choices of both players.

2. **MEX Calculation**: The program checks for the first missing non-negative integer in the array `arr` without considering the fact that Bob will remove elements that could affect the MEX calculation in Alice's favor.

3. **Handling of Single Occurrences**: The logic `if mpp[i] == 1 and first` is incorrect for determining the MEX in the context of the game. The program incorrectly assumes that the first number with a single occurrence will be the MEX, which is not necessarily true given the alternating turns and the objective of each player.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to simulate the game turns and keep track of the elements that are added to `c` and removed from `a`. The correct approach involves considering the frequency of elements and the alternating turns to determine the optimal MEX.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        mex = 0
        while mex in mpp:
            if mpp[mex] % 2 == 0:
                mex += 1
            else:
                break
        print(mex)

func()
```

In this corrected version, the program calculates the MEX by considering the frequency of each number. If a number appears an even number of times, it can be completely removed by Bob, so the MEX is incremented. If a number appears an odd number of times, Alice can ensure that it ends up in `c`, and thus the MEX is the smallest such number.
