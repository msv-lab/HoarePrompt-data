You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
            a = list1[p - 1]
            list1.pop(p - 1)
            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
            a = list1[p - 1]
            list1.pop(p - 1)
            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99, and the length of lst is an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50. This list represents the array a for a single test case. The function will be called multiple times, once for each test case, with different lists. The number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 <= t <= 10^3.
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns True if lst is already sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers, `lst`, where each integer is between 0 and 99, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50. It returns `True` if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order; otherwise, it returns `False`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the logic for splitting numbers greater than or equal to 10 and checking if the array can be sorted is flawed.

Here are a few issues with the code:
1. The code only attempts to split a number once and only if the number is greater than the next number in the list. This is not sufficient because it does not account for the possibility of needing to split multiple numbers or splitting numbers that are not immediately followed by a smaller number.
2. The code does not handle the case where a number needs to be split into more than two digits correctly. For example, if the number is 123, it should be split into 1, 2, and 3, not just 1 and 23.
3. The function `func_1` checks if the list is sorted, but the main loop only runs once per test case, which is insufficient to ensure that all necessary splits have been made.

Let's consider a specific example to demonstrate the issue:
Input:
```
1
3
30 2 10
```
Expected Output:
```
YES
```
Explanation:
- The number 30 can be split into 3 and 0.
- The number 10 can be split into 1 and 0.
- After splitting, the array becomes [3, 0, 2, 1, 0], which can be rearranged to [0, 0, 1, 2, 3] to be sorted.

However, the provided code will not handle this case correctly because it only attempts to split numbers once and only if they are greater than the next number in the list. In this case, it will not split 30 or 10, and thus will incorrectly determine that the array cannot be sorted.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.
