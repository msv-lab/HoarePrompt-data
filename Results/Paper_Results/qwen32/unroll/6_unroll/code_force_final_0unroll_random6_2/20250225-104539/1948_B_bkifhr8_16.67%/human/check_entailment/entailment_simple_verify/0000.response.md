### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code, considering the annotations and the original assessment.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting numbers greater than or equal to 10 into their individual digits.
- The code should handle multiple test cases, each with an array of integers between 0 and 99.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Outer Loop (`for i in range(t)`):**
   - Iterates through each test case.
2. **Inner Loop (`for p in range(1, len(list1))`):**
   - Iterates through the array, checking if the current element is greater than the next element and greater than 10.
   - If so, it splits the current element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.
3. **Function `func_1(lst)`:**
   - Checks if the list is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version.

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Single Pass Limitation:**
   - The inner loop only runs once per test case. This means that if a split operation results in a new number that needs to be split further, it won't be handled.
   - For example, if the array is `[123, 4]`, the code will split `123` into `1` and `23`, but it won't then split `23` into `2` and `3`.
2. **Insufficient Splitting Logic:**
   - The code only splits numbers into two digits (e.g., `12` into `1` and `2`). It does not handle numbers with more than two digits correctly.
3. **No Repeated Checking:**
   - After a split, the code does not re-evaluate the entire array to ensure that further splits are necessary.

#### Example Analysis:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  3
  30 2 10
  ```
- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  YES
  ```
- **Code Behavior:**
  - The code will check `30` and `2`. Since `30 > 2`, it will split `30` into `3` and `0`, resulting in `[3, 0, 2, 10]`.
  - It will then check `0` and `2`, which are in order.
  - Next, it will check `2` and `10`, which are in order.
  - However, it won't split `10` into `1` and `0` because `2 <= 10`.
  - The final array is `[3, 0, 2, 10]`, which is not sorted.
  - The function `func_1` will return `False`, and the output will be `NO`.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided code does not handle all cases as specified in the problem description. It only performs a single pass through the array and does not handle numbers with more than two digits correctly. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
