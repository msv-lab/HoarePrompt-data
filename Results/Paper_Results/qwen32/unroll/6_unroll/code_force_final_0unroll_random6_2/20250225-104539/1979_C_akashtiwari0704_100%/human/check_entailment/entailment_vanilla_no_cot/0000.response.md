Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem by using the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers to determine the bets. However, the logic for ensuring that the total bet is strictly less than the received amount for each winning outcome is flawed.

The current implementation calculates the LCM of the multipliers and then sets each bet to be the LCM divided by the corresponding multiplier. The sum of these bets is then compared to the LCM. If the sum is not less than the LCM, it outputs -1, indicating no valid distribution exists. However, this approach does not guarantee that the sum of bets will always be strictly less than the received amount for each winning outcome.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the sum of all bets is strictly less than the received amount for each winning outcome. A simple and effective strategy is to set each bet to be one less than the corresponding multiplier. This ensures that the total sum of bets will be strictly less than the received amount for any winning outcome.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        bets = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        ans = [k - 1 for k in a]
        total_bet = sum(ans)
        valid = all(k * x > total_bet for k, x in zip(a, ans))
        if valid:
            print(' '.join(map(str, ans)))
        else:
            print(-1)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that each bet is one less than the corresponding multiplier, and it checks if the total bet is strictly less than the received amount for each winning outcome. If the condition is met, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints -1.
