The code snippet provided initializes a variable `cd` to `0`. This does not affect the other variables `N` or `nums` in any way. Therefore, the values of `N` and `nums` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the number of test cases; `nums` is a sorted list of integers derived from the unique numbers from the input line with `0` inserted at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is greater than 3; `cd` is `0`.**
