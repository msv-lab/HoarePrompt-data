The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, and stores these components in a set called `nums`. This means that `nums` will contain unique elements from the input line. The initial state mentions that the function `func_1` operates on input provided through standard input, and each test case consists of two lines. However, the provided code snippet only processes one line of input, which is expected to be the second line of a test case (the line containing `n` integers).

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the number of test cases; `nums` is a set of strings representing the unique numbers from the input line.**

Explanation: The variable `nums` is now a set of strings, each representing a unique number from the input line. The variable `N` remains unchanged as it represents the number of test cases and is not affected by the provided code snippet.
