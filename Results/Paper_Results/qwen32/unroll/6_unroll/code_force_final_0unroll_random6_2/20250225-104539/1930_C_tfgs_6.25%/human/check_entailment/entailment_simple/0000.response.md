### Reasoning:

The program aims to generate the lexicographically largest array `b` by performing a series of operations on the input array `a`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and how it aligns with the problem statement:

1. **Initial Transformation:**
   - For each element `a_i` in the array `a`, the program adds `i + 1` to it, where `i` is the 0-based index of the element. This is achieved by the line `a[i] += i + 1`. This transformation modifies the array `a` such that each element becomes `a_i + i + 1`.

2. **Removing Duplicates and Sorting:**
   - The program then removes duplicates from the transformed array `a` by converting it to a set and back to a list, and sorts it in descending order. This is done using `a = list(set(a))` followed by `a.sort(reverse=True)`. This ensures that all unique elements are considered and sorted in the desired order.

3. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` object to keep track of the occurrences of each element in the original transformed array `a`. This helps in determining how many duplicates of each element were originally present.
   - It then iterates over the sorted list `a` and for each element, it adds additional elements to the result list `ans` if there were duplicates of the previous element. The number of additional elements added is the minimum of the difference between the previous and current element minus one, the remaining count of duplicates (`cnt`), and the count of the previous element in the original array.
   - This step ensures that the lexicographically largest possible array is constructed by adding the maximum possible number of elements that are just smaller than the current element in the sorted list.

4. **Final Adjustments:**
   - If there are still remaining duplicates (`cnt` > 0) after the loop, the program appends additional elements to `ans` that are one less than the last element in `ans`. This ensures that the final array `b` is of length `n` and is lexicographically largest.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the resulting array `b`.

### Analysis:

The program correctly implements the logic to generate the lexicographically largest array `b` as described in the problem statement. It correctly handles the transformation of the array, removal of duplicates, and the construction of the final array by considering the counts of duplicates. The use of a `Counter` object ensures that the program accurately tracks the number of duplicates and adds the correct number of additional elements to the result.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct as it follows the problem statement accurately and generates the desired output.

**Correctness: True**
