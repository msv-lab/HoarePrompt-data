### Reasoning:
The provided program aims to solve the problem by following these steps:

1. **Modify the Array**: For each element in the array `a`, it adds the 1-based index to the element itself. This step is correctly implemented by the line `a[i] += i + 1`.

2. **Remove Duplicates**: The program uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each element and then converts the list to a set to remove duplicates. This is done with `counter = Counter(a)` and `a = list(set(a))`.

3. **Sort in Descending Order**: The list `a` is then sorted in descending order using `a.sort(reverse=True)`. This step is also correctly implemented.

4. **Construct the Result**: The program constructs the final list `ans` by iterating through the sorted list `a`. It inserts additional elements to fill the gaps between consecutive elements in descending order, ensuring that the total length of `ans` is `n`. This is done in the loop where it checks for gaps and fills them with the appropriate number of elements.

5. **Handle Remaining Elements**: If there are still elements to be added to reach the length `n`, it appends the necessary number of elements, each one less than the last element added, using the loop `for _ in range(cnt): ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)`.

### Verification:
The program correctly implements the logic to achieve the desired result. It ensures that the final list `b` is lexicographically largest by:
- Adding the index to each element to maximize the value.
- Removing duplicates to avoid inserting the same value multiple times.
- Sorting in descending order to ensure the largest values come first.
- Filling gaps between consecutive elements to maximize the lexicographical order.

### Conclusion:
Based on the above reasoning and the execution summary, the program appears to be correctly implementing the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
