The code `a = list(set(a))` converts the list `a` into a set to remove duplicate elements and then converts it back into a list. The length of `a` may decrease if there were any duplicates, but it will not increase. The `counter` object will no longer reflect the correct count of elements in `a` after this operation, as the duplicates have been removed.

Output State: **`n` is the same input integer representing the original length of array `a`; `a` is a list where each element at index `i` is the original value at that index plus `i + 1`, with duplicates removed; `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the original list `a`.**
