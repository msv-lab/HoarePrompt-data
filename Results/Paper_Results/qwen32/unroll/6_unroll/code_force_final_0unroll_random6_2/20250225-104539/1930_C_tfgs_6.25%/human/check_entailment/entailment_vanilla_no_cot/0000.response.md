Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the lexicographically largest array `b` that can be constructed. The issue lies in the way it handles the insertion of values into the set `S` and the construction of the final array `b`.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Insertion into Set `S`:**
   - The program simply adds `a[i] + i + 1` to the list `a` and then converts it to a set to remove duplicates. However, the problem specifies that we need to perform the operations in a strategic manner to maximize the lexicographical order of the resulting array `b`.

2. **Constructing the Final Array `b`:**
   - The program attempts to construct the array `b` by sorting the unique elements of `a` in descending order and then inserting additional elements based on the count of each element. However, this does not guarantee the lexicographically largest array `b` because the order of operations (which elements are chosen and when) significantly affects the final result.

3. **Strategy for Maximizing Lexicographical Order:**
   - To maximize the lexicographical order, we need to strategically choose which element to add to the set `S` in each step. This means we should aim to add the largest possible values first, which often involves choosing elements from the end of the array `a` first, as specified in the example.

Here is a corrected version of the program that follows the strategy of always choosing the last element of the array `a` to add to the set `S`:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    S = set()
    for i in range(n):
        S.add(a[-1] + n)
        a.pop()
        n -= 1
    b = sorted(S, reverse=True)
    print(*b)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that we always add the largest possible value to the set `S` in each step, leading to the lexicographically largest array `b`.
