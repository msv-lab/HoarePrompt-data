Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for counting the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions is incorrect. Specifically, the program does not properly implement the condition that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a brief explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. The program iterates over possible values of \(i\) up to \(b\), but \(i\) is not defined in the problem context. Instead, it seems to be trying to iterate over possible values of \(b\), but the logic inside the loop is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

2. The calculation of `x` and the conditions inside the loop do not correctly reflect the problem's requirement that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. The final adjustment by subtracting 2 from `suma` is not justified by the problem's logic.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given ranges and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This can be done efficiently using the properties of the greatest common divisor and the constraints provided.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

This corrected program iterates over all pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition directly, which is feasible given the constraints. However, for very large inputs, further optimizations would be necessary, such as reducing the number of gcd calculations or using mathematical insights to count valid pairs more efficiently.
