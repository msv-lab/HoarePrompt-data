Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by iterating through all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m` and calculating the number of valid `a` values for each `b` that satisfy the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, the logic used in the program to calculate the number of valid pairs seems incorrect and does not align with the problem description.

Let's break down the logic in the program:
1. It reads the number of test cases `T`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
3. It initializes a variable `suma` to 0.
4. It iterates over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`.
5. For each `b`, it calculates `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` and adds it to `suma` if `x` is greater than 0.
6. It checks an additional condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` to add 1 more to `suma`.
7. Finally, it prints `suma - 2`.

The logic in the program does not correctly implement the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The formula used to calculate `x` and the conditions to add to `suma` do not make sense in the context of the problem. The program seems to be attempting to count the number of valid `a` values for each `b`, but the approach is flawed.

The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b` and checking if the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` holds true. However, this approach would be inefficient given the constraints (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6).

Given the flawed logic and the fact that the program does not correctly implement the required condition, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
