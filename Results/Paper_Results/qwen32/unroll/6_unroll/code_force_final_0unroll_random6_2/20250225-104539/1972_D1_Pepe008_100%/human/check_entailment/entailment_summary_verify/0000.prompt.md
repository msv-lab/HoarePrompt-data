You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
import  math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then calculates a value `suma` based on these inputs and outputs `suma - 2` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: Let's analyze the provided code and the problem description to determine if the code meets the requirements.

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The provided code attempts to solve this problem by iterating over all possible values of \(b\) and calculating the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\). However, there are several issues with the code:

1. The logic for calculating the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(b\) seems flawed. The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` does not directly relate to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. The code incorrectly adjusts the sum by subtracting 2 at the end without a clear reason. This adjustment is not explained and does not align with the logic needed to solve the problem.

3. The condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is not relevant to the problem and seems to be an incorrect attempt to handle specific cases.

Let's consider a simple test case to demonstrate the issue:
- Input: `1 1`
- Expected output: `1` (only the pair (1, 1) satisfies the condition)
- Code output: `-1` (due to the incorrect logic and the `-2` adjustment)

Another test case:
- Input: `2 2`
- Expected output: `3` (pairs (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2) satisfy the condition)
- Code output: `-1` (incorrect logic and `-2` adjustment)

Given these issues and the lack of a clear and correct logic to solve the problem, the code is incorrect.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected code iterates over all pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition directly, ensuring correctness for all cases.
