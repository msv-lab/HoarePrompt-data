Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

We need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Condition Analysis

The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \(k\).

Let \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then we can write:
\[ a = dx \]
\[ b = dy \]
where \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime (i.e., \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\)).

Substituting these into the condition:
\[ dx + dy = k \cdot dy \cdot d \]
\[ dx + dy = k \cdot d^2 y \]
\[ x + y = k \cdot d y \]
\[ x = (k \cdot d - 1) y \]

This means \(x\) must be a multiple of \(y\). Since \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, the only solution is \(y = 1\) and \(x = k \cdot d - 1\).

Thus, \(b = d\) and \(a = (k \cdot d - 1)\). Therefore, for each \(d\) from 1 to \(\min(n, m)\), \(a\) can take values \(d, 2d-1, 3d-1, \ldots\) up to \(n\).

### Correctness of the Provided Program

Let's analyze the provided program:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)
```

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Loop and Calculation**:
   - The loop runs from 1 to \(b\), which doesn't align with the derived condition that \(d\) should go up to \(\min(n, m)\).
   - The calculation of `x` and the logic to add to `suma` is not correctly derived from the problem condition.
   - The condition `if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0` is not meaningful in the context of the problem.
   - The final `suma - 2` is unclear and doesn't reflect the correct count of valid pairs.

2. **Logic Mismatch**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic of counting pairs based on the derived condition \(x = (k \cdot d - 1)\).

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic and calculations are mismatched with the problem requirements.

**Correctness: False**
