### Reasoning:

The provided code is intended to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions. However, the code does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. 

Let's break down the problem requirements and the code logic:

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Condition**: \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).
2. **Range**: \( 1 \leq a \leq n \) and \( 1 \leq b \leq m \).

#### Code Analysis:
The code iterates over possible values of `b` from 1 to `m` and calculates `suma` based on a formula involving `a` and `b`. However, the formula used in the code does not correctly reflect the problem's condition. Specifically, the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` and the condition checks do not accurately determine whether \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) and check if the condition \( (a + b) \% (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0 \) holds. Given the constraints, a brute-force approach might be inefficient, so optimizations or mathematical insights are necessary to handle large inputs efficiently.

#### Provided Code:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)

func()
```

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) as per the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
