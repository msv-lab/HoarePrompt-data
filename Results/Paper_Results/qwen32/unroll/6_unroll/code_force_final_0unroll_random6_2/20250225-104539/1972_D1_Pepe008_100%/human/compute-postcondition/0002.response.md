To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the nested loop and the computations involved.

For each test case, the code calculates a sum `suma` based on the values of `a` and `b`. The outer loop runs `T` times, once for each test case. Inside the outer loop, `a` and `b` are read from the input. The inner loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = b`, and for each `i`, it computes `x` as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. If `x` is greater than 0, it adds `x` to `suma`. Additionally, if `(a - i * (i - 1))` is divisible by `i ** 2` and `i * (i - 1)` is divisible by `i ** 2` (which simplifies to checking if `i` is 1), it adds 1 more to `suma`. Finally, it prints `suma - 2`.

Since the final value of `suma` is dependent on the specific values of `a` and `b` for each test case, the output after all iterations will be a series of integers, each corresponding to the result of the computation for a single test case.

However, without specific values for `T`, `a`, and `b`, we can't compute the exact numerical output. But we can describe the output state in terms of the computations performed.

Output State: **After executing all iterations, the output state consists of T lines, each line containing the value of `suma - 2` for the respective test case, where `suma` is computed based on the values of `a` and `b` for that test case as described in the code.**
