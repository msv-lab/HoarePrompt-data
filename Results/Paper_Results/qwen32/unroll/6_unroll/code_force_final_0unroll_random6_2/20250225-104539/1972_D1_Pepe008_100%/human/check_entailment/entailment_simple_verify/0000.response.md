### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided code and explains why it is incorrect. Let's break down the reasoning and the annotations to ensure a comprehensive understanding.

#### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Provided Code Analysis:

The code provided attempts to solve this by iterating over possible values of \(b\) and calculating the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\). However, the logic used to determine the number of valid \(a\) values is flawed, and the final adjustment by subtracting 2 is unjustified.

**Annotations:**
- The annotations describe the state of the program right before the function call and after processing each test case.
- They confirm that the program iterates over each test case and computes `suma` based on the given formula, but they do not validate the correctness of the formula or the final adjustment.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Formula**: The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` does not correctly determine the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(b\).
2. **Incorrect Adjustment**: The final subtraction of 2 is not logically justified and results in incorrect outputs for test cases.
3. **Irrelevant Condition**: The condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` does not align with the problem's requirements.

#### Test Cases:
- **Input: `1 1`**
  - Expected Output: `1`
  - Code Output: `-1` (due to incorrect logic and the `-2` adjustment)

- **Input: `2 2`**
  - Expected Output: `3`
  - Code Output: `-1` (incorrect logic and `-2` adjustment)

#### Corrected Code:
The corrected code proposed in the original assessment iterates over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition directly:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)
```

This corrected code ensures that the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is checked for all pairs \((a, b)\), thereby providing the correct output.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code contains logical errors in its approach and does not correctly solve the problem as described. The corrected version of the code, which directly checks the condition for all pairs \((a, b)\), is the correct solution.

**Final: False**
