### Reasoning:

The original assessment highlights several issues with the provided code, and these points are valid. Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Incomplete Implementation**: The provided code does not perform any operations to insert the sum of any subarray into the array. It only identifies the maximum subarray sum using `func_2`. This is insufficient because the problem requires performing `k` operations where you insert the sum of a subarray anywhere in the array to maximize the total sum.

2. **Inadequate Handling of Operations**: The code does not handle the `k` operations as described in the problem. It does not repeatedly insert the sum of a subarray into the array to maximize the total sum.

3. **Lack of Modulo Operation**: Although `func_1` is defined to compute a number modulo \(10^9 + 7\), it is not used in the main logic to ensure that all operations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Incomplete Functionality**: The function `func_3` is defined but not implemented, and it does not seem to be used in the code.

The annotations confirm these points:
- `func_1` correctly computes the modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
- `func_2` correctly identifies the maximum subarray sum but does not perform any operations to insert this sum back into the array.
- `func_3` is not used and is incomplete.

### Correct Implementation:
The correct approach, as outlined in the original assessment, involves:
- Using Kadane's algorithm (or a similar method) to find the maximum subarray sum.
- Repeatedly inserting the maximum subarray sum back into the array to maximize the total sum.
- Ensuring all operations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the original assessment and validated by the annotations, the provided code is indeed incorrect as it does not fully implement the required functionality to solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
