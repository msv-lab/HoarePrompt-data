Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers; `new_segment` is an empty list; `max_segment` is [sum of the last segment, end index of the last segment]; `segments_variants` is a list of all considered segments including `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and `[len(arr) - 1]`; `max_sum` is -1; `total_max_segment` is [-1].**

Explanation: The value of `total_max_segment` has been changed to `[-1]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
