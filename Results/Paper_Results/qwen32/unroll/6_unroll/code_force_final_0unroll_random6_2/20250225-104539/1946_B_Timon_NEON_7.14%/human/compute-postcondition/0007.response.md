The code appends a new segment to the `segments_variants` list. The new segment is created by concatenating `new_segment` (which is an empty list) with a list containing the last index of `arr` (`len(arr) - 1`).

Given that `new_segment` is an empty list, the new segment added to `segments_variants` is simply `[len(arr) - 1]`.

Therefore, the updated `segments_variants` list will include the previously considered segments and the new segment `[len(arr) - 1]`.

The values of the other variables (`arr`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `max_sum`) do not change.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers; `new_segment` is an empty list; `max_segment` is [sum of the last segment, end index of the last segment]; `segments_variants` is a list of all considered segments including the new segment `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and `[len(arr) - 1]`; `max_sum` is -1.**
