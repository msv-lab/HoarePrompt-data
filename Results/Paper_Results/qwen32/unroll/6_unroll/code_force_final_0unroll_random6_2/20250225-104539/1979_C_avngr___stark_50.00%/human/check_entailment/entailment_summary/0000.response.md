### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine a way to distribute bets such that, for any winning outcome, the total amount of coins received is strictly greater than the total amount of coins bet. The program uses the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers to determine the bets and then normalizes these bets to the smallest possible integers while maintaining the required condition.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.

2. **Calculating the LCM:**
   - The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k` by multiplying all the multipliers together. This is stored in the variable `m`.

3. **Determining Bets:**
   - For each outcome, the program calculates the bet as `m / k[i]`. This ensures that if the i-th outcome wins, the returned amount will be `k[i] * (m / k[i]) = m`, which is greater than the total bet `m` if the bets are distributed correctly.

4. **Normalization:**
   - The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the bets and divides each bet by this GCD to minimize the bet values while maintaining the required condition.

5. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the bets is less than the LCM divided by the GCD. If not, it prints `-1`, indicating that no valid distribution exists.
   - If a valid distribution exists, it prints the bets.

6. **Execution Summary Misinterpretation:**
   - The execution summary incorrectly describes the function `func_1` as calculating the GCD of all elements, including the first element `t`. However, `func_1` correctly calculates the GCD of the list `c`, which contains the bets. The first element `t` is not part of this list.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets for each outcome. It calculates the LCM of the multipliers, determines the bets, normalizes them, and checks if the distribution is feasible. The execution summary has a minor misinterpretation but does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Correctness: **True**
