### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to solve the problem by determining a suitable distribution of bets for each of the possible outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.

2. **Calculating LCM:**
   - The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k` by multiplying all the multipliers together. This is stored in variable `m`.

3. **Generating Candidate Bets:**
   - It then generates a list `c` of candidate bets for each outcome. Each candidate bet `c[i]` is calculated as `m / k[i]`, which essentially distributes the LCM among the outcomes in a manner that the sum of all bets is `m`.

4. **Finding GCD:**
   - The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the candidate bets `c` using the `func_1` function. This GCD is stored in variable `hcf`.

5. **Normalizing Bets:**
   - The candidate bets `c` are then normalized by dividing each by the GCD `hcf`. This ensures that the bets are as small as possible while maintaining the required conditions.

6. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the normalized bets is less than `m / hcf`. If the sum is not less, it outputs `-1`, indicating that no suitable distribution of bets is possible.
   - If the sum is less, it prints the normalized bets as the solution.

### Issues and Correctness:

- **Incorrect GCD Calculation:**
  - The `func_1` function is intended to calculate the GCD of the list `c`, but the comment suggests it is calculating the GCD of `t` and the subsequent elements in the list `numbers`. This is incorrect because `t` is not part of the list `c`.
  - The function `func_1` should only calculate the GCD of the elements in `c`.

- **Feasibility Check:**
  - The feasibility check `if sum(c) >= m / hcf` is incorrect. The correct check should be `if sum(c) >= m / hcf`, but the logic to ensure `sum(c) < m / hcf` is correct.

- **Output:**
  - The output of the program is correct if the feasibility check passes, but the GCD calculation needs to be corrected.

Given the above points, the program is not entirely correct due to the incorrect GCD calculation. The GCD should only be calculated for the list `c`, not including `t`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
