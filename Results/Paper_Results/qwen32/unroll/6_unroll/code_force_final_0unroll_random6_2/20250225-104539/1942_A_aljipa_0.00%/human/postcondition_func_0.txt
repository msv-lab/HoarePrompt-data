The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3). It then prints a list of `n` ones if `k` equals `n`, a list of the first `n` non-negative integers if `k` equals 1, and a list with a single element `-1` if `k` is neither `n` nor `1`.
