The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. Specifically:

- **Case_1:** The function returns a specific value or result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.

Given the constraints and the provided output structure, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` (with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3). It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
