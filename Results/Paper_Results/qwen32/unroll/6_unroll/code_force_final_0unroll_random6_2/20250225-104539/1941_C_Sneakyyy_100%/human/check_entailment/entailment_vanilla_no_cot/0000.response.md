Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. The issue arises from the way the program handles overlapping occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie". The program only checks non-overlapping segments of three characters at a time, which means it might miss cases where removing a character from one substring could prevent another from forming.

For example, consider the string "mappie". The program would identify "map" and "pie" as separate substrings and attempt to remove them independently, leading to an incorrect result. A correct approach would involve a more sophisticated method to detect and handle overlapping occurrences, possibly using dynamic programming or a similar technique to ensure minimal deletions.

Here's a brief outline of a correct approach:
1. Use dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum deletions required up to each position in the string.
2. For each position, consider the cost of deleting the current character or the cost of removing a substring "map" or "pie" if it appears.
3. Update the minimum deletions required for the entire string based on these calculations.

The current program does not implement such logic, hence it is incorrect.
