Reasoning:  
The given program is designed to solve the problem by counting non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in each string `s` and printing the count, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful. The program iterates through each test case, reads the length of the string and the string itself, and then uses a while loop to check for the substrings "map" and "pie". If such a substring is found, it increments the `ans` counter and skips the next two characters (ensuring non-overlapping by moving the index `i` by 3). If no such substring is found, it simply moves to the next character by incrementing `i` by 1. The final count `ans` is printed for each test case.

However, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to find the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie", not just non-overlapping ones. The current implementation may miss overlapping occurrences of these substrings, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the string "ppiepie". The correct answer should be 2, as we can remove the 'p' from the first "pie" and the second 'e' from the second "pie" to make the string beautiful. However, the program would only count one occurrence and output 1.

Thus, the program does not guarantee the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
