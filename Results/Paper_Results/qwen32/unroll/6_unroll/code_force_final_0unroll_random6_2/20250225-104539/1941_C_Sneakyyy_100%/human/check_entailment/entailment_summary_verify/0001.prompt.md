You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(a) - 2:
            s = a[i:i + 3]
            if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
                i += 3
                ans += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a string `s`. For each test case, it counts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in `s`, and prints this count.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of characters to remove from a string to make it beautiful, where a string is considered ugly if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map".

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. **Loop through test cases**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. **Read input for each test case**: For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `a` itself.
3. **Initialize variables**: It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the number of deletions required, and `i` to 0, which will be used as an index to traverse the string.
4. **Traverse the string**: The program uses a `while` loop to traverse through the string `a` in chunks of 3 characters at a time.
5. **Check for substrings "pie" or "map"**: Within the loop, it checks if the current 3-character substring `s` is either "pie" or "map".
6. **Update index and answer**: If the substring is "pie" or "map", it increments `i` by 3 (skipping the next two characters) and increments `ans` by 1 (indicating one deletion). If the substring is not "pie" or "map", it simply increments `i` by 1 to move to the next character.
7. **Output the result**: After the loop finishes for a test case, it prints the value of `ans`.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect handling of overlapping substrings**: The main issue with the current approach is that it does not correctly handle overlapping substrings. For example, if the string contains "pmapiemap", the program will only count 2 deletions (removing the first "map" and the second "pie"), but actually, only 2 deletions are needed to make the string beautiful (removing the first 'm' and the last 'p' or removing the first 'p' and the last 'e').
- **Inefficient for large inputs**: The approach is not optimal for large inputs, as it does not consider the minimum deletions required to remove all occurrences of "pie" and "map".

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program does not always produce the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
