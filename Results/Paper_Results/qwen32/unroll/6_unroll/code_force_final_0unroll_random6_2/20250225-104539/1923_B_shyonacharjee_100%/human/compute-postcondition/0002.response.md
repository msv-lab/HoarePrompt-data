Output State: **t is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4; n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^9, a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, x is a list of n integers where each element x_i satisfies -n <= x_i <= n, x_i != 0, and the elements are strictly increasing (x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. After processing all t test cases, the program will have printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on whether it is possible to defeat all monsters with the given constraints. The variables n, k, a, x, monsters, bullets_used, can_survive are no longer in scope or have been reset for the next iteration.**
