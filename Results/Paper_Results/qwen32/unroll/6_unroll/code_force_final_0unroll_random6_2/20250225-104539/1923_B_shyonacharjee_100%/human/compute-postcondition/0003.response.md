Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of elements in lists `a` and `x`, an integer `k`, and two lists: `a` containing `n` integers and `x` containing `n` strictly increasing integers. The function returns a value based on the given constraints for each test case.**
