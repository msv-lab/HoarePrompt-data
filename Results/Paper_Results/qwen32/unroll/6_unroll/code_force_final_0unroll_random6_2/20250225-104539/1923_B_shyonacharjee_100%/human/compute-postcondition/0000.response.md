Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= `t` <= 3 * 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 2 * 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `x` is a list of `n` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies -`n` <= `x_i` <= `n`, `x_i` != 0, and the elements are strictly increasing (x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to the input integer, while all other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `x`) retain their initial descriptions and constraints.
