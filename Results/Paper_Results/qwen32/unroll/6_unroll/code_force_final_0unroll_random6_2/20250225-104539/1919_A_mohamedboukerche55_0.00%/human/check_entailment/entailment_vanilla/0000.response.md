Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description and the given sample inputs and outputs.

### Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the two integers `a` and `b` which represent the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

2. **Logic for Determining the Winner:**
   - The program checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, it outputs "bob".
   - If the sum is odd, it outputs "alice".

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the name of the winner for each test case.

### Correctness of the Logic

The logic in the program is based on the observation that the game is essentially a simple parity game. Here's why:

- **Even Sum Case:** If `a + b` is even, then both players will eventually run out of coins at the same time if they play optimally. Since Bob always plays after Alice, Alice will be the one who cannot make a move first, hence Bob wins.
- **Odd Sum Case:** If `a + b` is odd, then one player will have one more turn than the other. Since Alice goes first, she will be the one to make the last move, hence she wins.

### Issues in the Provided Program

1. **Indentation Error:**
   - The `if` and `else` statements are incorrectly indented. They should be inside the loop that processes each test case. As it is, the program only considers the last test case and prints the result `t` times.

2. **Output Spacing:**
   - The program prints "bob  " with an extra space. It should print "Bob" without any extra spaces.

### Corrected Program

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

### Conclusion

The original program has logical correctness in determining the winner based on the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`, but it has issues with indentation and output formatting. After correcting these issues, the program becomes correct.

Correctness: **False** (due to indentation and output formatting issues)

However, if we consider only the logic and ignore the formatting and indentation issues, the logic is correct.

For the purpose of this task, considering the exact code provided:

Correctness: **False**
