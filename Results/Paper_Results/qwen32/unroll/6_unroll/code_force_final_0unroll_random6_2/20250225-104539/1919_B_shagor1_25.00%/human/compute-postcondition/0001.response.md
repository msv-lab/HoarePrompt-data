The code snippet `s = input()` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. This means the value of `s` will be updated to whatever string the user inputs, which is guaranteed to be of length `n` and consist only of the characters '+' and '-'.

The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '+' and '-' as provided by the user.**
