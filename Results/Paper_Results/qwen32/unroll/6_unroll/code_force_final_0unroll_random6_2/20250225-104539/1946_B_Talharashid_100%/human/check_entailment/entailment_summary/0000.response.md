Reasoning:
The provided program aims to solve the problem by finding the maximum possible sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting any contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array. The program calculates the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray (using a variation of Kadane's algorithm) and then uses this maximum sum to compute the final result based on `k`.

However, there are a few issues with the program:
1. **Incorrect Formula**: The formula used in the print statement is not correct. The idea is to maximize the sum of the array by repeatedly adding the maximum subarray sum. The correct formula should be based on the fact that each operation can add the maximum subarray sum to the array, and this can be done up to `k` times. The correct formula is `(sum(l) + max_subarray_sum * k) % 1000000007`.
2. **Handling Negative Maximum Subarray Sum**: The program does not correctly handle cases where the maximum subarray sum is negative. In such cases, the best strategy is to insert zeros (empty subarrays) to avoid decreasing the sum of the array.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
