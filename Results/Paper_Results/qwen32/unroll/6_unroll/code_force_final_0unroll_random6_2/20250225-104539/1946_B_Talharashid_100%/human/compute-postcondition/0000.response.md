The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable, and the range is determined by `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`, which corresponds to the variable `t` mentioned in the state description.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1 because `int(input())` will provide the value of `t`, and `range(t)` will generate values from 0 to `t-1`. If `t` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute. No other variables in the loop head (`i`) can be adjusted directly since `i` is just the loop variable that will take on values from 0 to `t-1`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
