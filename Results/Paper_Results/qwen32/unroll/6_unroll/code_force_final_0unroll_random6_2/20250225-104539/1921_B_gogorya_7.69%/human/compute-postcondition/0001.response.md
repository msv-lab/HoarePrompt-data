In the provided task, the for loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will execute `t` times. The variables `n`, `s`, and `f` are defined within the loop body, and thus, we cannot adjust their states before the loop starts according to the instructions. The only variable we can adjust is `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

Given that `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, the loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. Therefore, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `t` is within the valid range and is at least 1 to guarantee that the loop will execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4**
