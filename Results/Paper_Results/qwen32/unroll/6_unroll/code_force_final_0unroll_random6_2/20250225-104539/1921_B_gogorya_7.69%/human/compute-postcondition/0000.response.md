Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, a string `s` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, and a string `f` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to be an integer input by the user, while the conditions and constraints for the remaining variables (`n`, `s`, `f`) remain unchanged as they are yet to be assigned values in the provided code snippet.
