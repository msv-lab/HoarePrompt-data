You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

        print(n - max(cn, ck))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates and prints an integer value based on the list `a`. The printed value is the result of subtracting the maximum length of consecutive identical elements from the start or end of the list from `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases for the problem description. Specifically, the program only considers the longest prefix and suffix of the array that consists of the same element and calculates the minimum burles based on that. However, this approach does not account for the possibility of selecting a middle segment to change and achieving a lower cost.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
To make all elements equal, we can select the segment from index 2 to 4 (i=2, j=4) and change all elements to 1 or 2. This will cost 3 burles. However, a more optimal solution is to select the segment from index 1 to 3 (i=1, j=3) or from index 3 to 5 (i=3, j=5) and change all elements to 2 or 1, respectively. This will cost 3 burles as well, but we can achieve the same result by selecting a smaller segment. For example, selecting the segment from index 2 to 3 (i=2, j=3) and changing all elements to 1 will cost 2 burles, which is the minimum.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
The program will output `3` for the above input, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and the correctness is **False**.
