Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`); `n` is the length of the array; `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`.**

In simple terms, the output state is that `array` remains the same list of integers representing a permutation, `find` remains the same integer, and `n` is still the length of the array. The new variables `l` and `r` have been set to 0 and `n - 1`, respectively.
