### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions.
2. **Inputs**:
   - `n`: Number of children.
   - `m`: Number of pairs of friends.
   - `k`: Number of excursions.
   - `m` lines follow, each specifying a pair of friends and their initial friendship value.
3. **Output**: For each test case, print the expected value modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads `m` lines, each specifying a pair of friends and their initial friendship value.

2. **Calculation of Probability**:
   - The program calculates `c` as the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is correct for representing the probability of selecting any specific pair.
   - However, the program incorrectly calculates `c` using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`, which simplifies to `pow(1, -1, M)`, resulting in `c = 1`. This is incorrect.

3. **Summation Logic**:
   - The program initializes `s` and `a` to `0`.
   - It sums up the initial friendship values in `a`.
   - The loop `for i in range(k)` attempts to update `s` using the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`. This formula is incorrect and does not reflect the expected value calculation.

#### Correct Approach:
1. **Probability Calculation**:
   - The probability of selecting any specific pair is `1 / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`.
   - The modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` should be correctly calculated as `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.

2. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - For each friend pair `(u, v)` with initial friendship value `f`, the expected increase in its friendship value over `k` excursions can be calculated.
   - The expected sum of friendship values for all pairs over `k` excursions can be derived using the correct probability and expected value formulas.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program contains significant errors in the calculation of the probability and the summation logic. The original assessment correctly identifies these issues and concludes that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
