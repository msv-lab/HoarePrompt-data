### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to determine the correctness of the solution against the problem description.

1. **Probability Calculation**:
   - The code calculates `c` as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs (`n * (n - 1) // 2`). However, the code incorrectly uses `1` instead of `n * (n - 1) // 2` in the `pow` function. This makes `c` equal to `1`, which is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.

2. **Summation Logic**:
   - The provided code attempts to sum the expected values but incorrectly uses the modular inverse `c` in the summation. The logic inside the `for i in range(k)` loop does not correctly account for the expected increase in friendship values over the `k` excursions.
   - The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` does not correctly reflect the expected value computation. The expected value for each friend pair over `k` excursions should be calculated based on the probability of selecting that pair and the expected increase in its friendship value.

3. **Handling of Friendship Values**:
   - The code sums up the initial friendship values in `a` but does not correctly incorporate the expected increase in these values over the `k` excursions.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each pair over `k` excursions.

1. **Probability of Selecting a Pair**:
   - The probability of selecting any specific pair is `1 / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`. This probability should be used to compute the expected contribution of each pair to the total sum of friendship values.

2. **Expected Increase in Friendship Values**:
   - For a friend pair with initial friendship value `f`, the expected increase in its friendship value over `k` excursions can be computed using the formula for the expected value of a sum of random variables. Specifically, the expected number of times a pair is chosen is `k / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`. The expected increase in friendship value for each selection is `1`, so the total expected increase in friendship value for a pair is `k / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`. Therefore, the expected contribution of a pair to the total sum is `f + k / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`.

3. **Summing Up Expected Values**:
   - Sum up the expected contributions of all friend pairs and compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Correct Implementation:

Here is a correct implementation of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        c = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)  # Correct calculation of the modular inverse
        expected_sum = 0
        
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            # Expected contribution of this pair
            expected_increase = (k * c) % M
            expected_contribution = (f + expected_increase) % M
            expected_sum = (expected_sum + expected_contribution) % M
        
        # Each non-friend pair contributes 0
        non_friend_pairs = total_pairs - m
        expected_sum = (expected_sum + (non_friend_pairs * (k * c) % M)) % M
        
        print(expected_sum)

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect due to the incorrect calculation of the modular inverse and the incorrect summation logic. The correct implementation should account for the probability of selecting each pair and the expected increase in friendship values over the `k` excursions.

### Final: **False**
