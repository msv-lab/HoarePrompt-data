Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts integers `n` (number of nodes), `m` (number of edges), and `k`. It also accepts `m` lines, each containing three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` representing an edge between nodes `a_i` and `b_i` with a feature value `f_i`. The function returns a value based on the given constraints and inputs for each test case.**
