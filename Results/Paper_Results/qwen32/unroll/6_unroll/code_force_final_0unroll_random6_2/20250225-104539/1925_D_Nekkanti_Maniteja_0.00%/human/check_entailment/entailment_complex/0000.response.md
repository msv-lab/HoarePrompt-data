Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem statement to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. The expected value can be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and we need to compute \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

### Provided Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, and then reads `m` lines of input representing pairs of friends and their initial friendship values.

The program calculates the following:
1. `M = 10 ** 9 + 7` - the modulo value.
2. `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)` - the modular multiplicative inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children. This is incorrect for two reasons:
   - The denominator should be `n * (n - 1) // 2`, not `n * (n - 1) // 1`.
   - The inverse is only needed if we were to divide by the total number of pairs, which is not the case here.
3. `s = 0` - initializes the sum.
4. `a = 0` - initializes the sum of all initial friendship values.
5. For each of the `m` lines, it adds the friendship value `f` to `a`.
6. For each of the `k` excursions, it updates `s` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a`.
7. Finally, it prints `s % M`.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Calculation of `c`**: The variable `c` is intended to represent the probability of selecting a specific pair of children, which should be \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\). The current code incorrectly calculates the inverse of `n * (n - 1)`, not `n * (n - 1) / 2`.
2. **Incorrect Update of `s`**: The update formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect. The correct approach involves calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions, which involves more complex probability calculations.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem:
1. Calculate the probability of selecting each friend pair, which is \(\frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).
2. For each friend pair, calculate the expected contribution to the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions.
3. Sum these contributions for all friend pairs.
4. Compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified in the provided program, it is clear that the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
