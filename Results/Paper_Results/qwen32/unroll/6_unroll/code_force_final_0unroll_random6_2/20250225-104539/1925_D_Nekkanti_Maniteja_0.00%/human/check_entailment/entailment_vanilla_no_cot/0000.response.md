Correctness: **False**

Let's analyze the given program and compare it to the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for k excursions. The result should be given as \( p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \) where \( \frac{p}{q} \) is the expected value in its simplest form.

2. **Key Points**:
   - The probability of selecting any pair of children is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - For each excursion, if a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1.
   - The expected value can be calculated by considering the probability of selecting each pair and their respective friendship values.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `M` is set to \( 10^9 + 7 \) for modulo operations.
   - `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of \( \binom{n}{2} \), which is the total number of possible pairs.
   - `s` is initialized to 0, which will hold the final result.
   - `a` is initialized to 0, which will accumulate the sum of initial friendship values.

3. **Processing Friendships**:
   - The program correctly accumulates the sum of initial friendship values in `a`.

4. **Calculating Expected Value**:
   - The loop `for i in range(k)` is intended to calculate the expected value, but the logic inside the loop is incorrect.
   - The formula used inside the loop does not correctly reflect the expected value calculation. The expected value should consider the probability of selecting each pair and the effect of increasing friendship values over excursions.

### Correct Approach:
- The expected value for each pair can be calculated by considering the probability of selecting it in each excursion and the effect of increasing friendship values.
- The expected contribution of each pair to the total sum can be calculated using the formula for the expected value of a geometric series adjusted for the increasing friendship values.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
