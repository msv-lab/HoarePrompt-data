You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        x = s.count('map')
        y = s.count('pie')
        z = s.count('mapie')
        print(x + y - z)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        x = s.count('map')
        
        y = s.count('pie')
        
        z = s.count('mapie')
        
        print(x + y - z)
        
    #State: For each test case, the number of occurrences of the substring 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s` is counted, and the number of occurrences of the substring 'mapie' is subtracted from their sum. The result is printed for each test case. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` from the initial state remain unchanged except that `s` is replaced by the next test case string in subsequent iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The given program is intended to determine the minimum number of characters that need to be removed from a string to make it beautiful by avoiding the substrings "pie" and "map". However, the logic in the provided program is incorrect.

The program counts the occurrences of "map", "pie", and "mapie" in the string and then calculates `x + y - z` to determine the number of deletions needed. This approach does not correctly account for overlapping substrings or the minimum deletions required to remove all occurrences of "pie" and "map".

For example, consider the string "mapie". The program would count 1 occurrence of "map", 1 occurrence of "pie", and 1 occurrence of "mapie", resulting in `1 + 1 - 1 = 1`. However, to make this string beautiful, we need to remove 2 characters (either the 'm' and 'p' from "map" or the 'p' and 'i' from "pie").

The correct approach would involve a more sophisticated method, such as dynamic programming or greedy algorithms, to ensure that we account for all overlapping substrings and find the minimum deletions required.

Correctness: **False**
