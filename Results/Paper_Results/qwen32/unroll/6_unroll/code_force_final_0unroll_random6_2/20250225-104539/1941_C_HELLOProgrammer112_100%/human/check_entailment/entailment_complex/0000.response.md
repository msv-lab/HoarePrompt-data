Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and subtracting the occurrences of the substring "mapie". However, this approach is incorrect. The problem requires finding the minimum number of deletions to make the string beautiful, which involves considering overlapping occurrences and ensuring that deletions are minimal.

The logic in the program does not correctly account for the minimum deletions required. For example, if the string contains multiple overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie", simply counting them and subtracting the overlap does not give the minimum deletions. The correct approach would involve dynamic programming or a more sophisticated method to ensure minimal deletions.

Here's a breakdown of why the current logic is flawed:
1. The program counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" but does not consider how these occurrences overlap or how to minimize deletions.
2. It subtracts the count of "mapie" to avoid double-counting, but this does not address the problem of minimizing the deletions required to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie".

Given the problem constraints and requirements, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is False.

Correctness: **False**
