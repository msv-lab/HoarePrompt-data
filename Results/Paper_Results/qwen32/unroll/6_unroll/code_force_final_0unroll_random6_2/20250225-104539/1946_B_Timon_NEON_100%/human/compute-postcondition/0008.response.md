The code snippet assigns the list `[-1]` to the variable `total_max_segment`. This change affects only the variable `total_max_segment`, while all other variables retain their initial values. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers; `new_segment` is []; `max_segment` is [sum of all elements in arr, starting index of the first non-negative number or 0]; `segments_variants` is a list of candidate segments with an additional segment equal to `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and an additional segment equal to `[len(arr) - 1]`; `max_sum` is -1; `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`.**
