The code appends a new segment to the `segments_variants` list. The new segment is formed by concatenating `new_segment` (which is an empty list) with a list containing the last index of `arr` (which is `len(arr) - 1`). Since `new_segment` is empty, the new segment added to `segments_variants` is simply `[len(arr) - 1]`.

Other variables (`arr`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `max_sum`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers; `new_segment` is []; `max_segment` is [sum of all elements in arr, starting index of the first non-negative number or 0]; `segments_variants` is a list of candidate segments with an additional segment equal to `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and an additional segment equal to `[len(arr) - 1]`; `max_sum` is -1.**
