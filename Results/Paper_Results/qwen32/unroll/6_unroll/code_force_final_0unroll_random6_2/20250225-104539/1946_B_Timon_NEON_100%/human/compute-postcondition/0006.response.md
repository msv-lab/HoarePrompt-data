The code appends a new segment to the `segments_variants` list. This new segment is formed by concatenating the `max_segment` list with a list containing the index `len(arr) - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `new_segment` is an empty list.
- `max_segment` is a list containing the sum of all elements in `arr` and the starting index of the first non-negative number in `arr` or 0 if all numbers are negative.
- `segments_variants` is a list of candidate segments.
- `max_sum` is -1.

The new segment to be appended is `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers; `new_segment` is []; `max_segment` is [sum of all elements in arr, starting index of the first non-negative number or 0]; `segments_variants` is a list of candidate segments with an additional segment equal to `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`; `max_sum` is -1.**
