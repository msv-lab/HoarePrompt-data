### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the original assessment and the provided code to determine if the program is correct based on the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations. Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array. The final sum should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program includes three functions:
1. **func_1(number)**: This function correctly returns the given number modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
2. **func_2(arr)**: This function is intended to find the maximum sum subarray within the given array `arr`. It initializes several variables and iterates through the array to find the maximum sum subarray and its endpoints. However, there are logical issues with this function:
   - It does not correctly handle cases where the maximum sum subarray is at the beginning or end of the array.
   - It does not handle arrays with all negative numbers correctly.
3. **func_3(number, quantity)**: This function is described as incomplete and does not seem to perform any action as per the provided code. The function summary does not match the implementation, which is essentially a no-op.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incomplete Functionality**: `func_3` is incomplete and does not perform any action. It should handle the logic of performing `k` operations.
2. **Incorrect Implementation**: `func_2` has logical errors. It does not correctly find the maximum sum subarray in all cases.
3. **Lack of Main Logic**: The program lacks the main logic to perform the operations and compute the final result.

#### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program is not correct as it does not properly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it lacks the main logic to perform the operations and compute the final result, and `func_2` has logical errors.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program is indeed incorrect due to the issues outlined.

**Final: False**
