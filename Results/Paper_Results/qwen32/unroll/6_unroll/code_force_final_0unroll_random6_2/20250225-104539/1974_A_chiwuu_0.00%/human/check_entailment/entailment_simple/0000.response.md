### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required to place the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons on the desktop.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means it has 15 cells.
   - 2x2 icons take up 4 cells each.
   - 1x1 icons take up 1 cell each.
   - The goal is to place the icons on the minimum number of screens.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `a` (number of 1x1 icons) and `b` (number of 2x2 icons).
   - It calculates `t = b * 2` which is the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons.
   - It then calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons (`t // 5 + 1` if `t % 5 != 0`).
   - It calculates the remaining cells available after placing the 2x2 icons (`t * 15 - b * 4`).
   - It checks if the remaining cells are enough to place the 1x1 icons. If not, it calculates additional screens required for the 1x1 icons.
   - Finally, it prints the total number of screens required.

3. **Verification with Example Test Cases:**
   - For the first test case (1 1):
     - 1 2x2 icon takes 4 cells, so it needs 1 screen (since 4 cells < 15).
     - 1 cell is left, which is enough for 1 1x1 icon.
     - Total screens needed = 1.
   - For the third test case (12 4):
     - 4 2x2 icons take 16 cells, so they need 2 screens (since 16 cells > 15, 2 screens are required).
     - Remaining cells on 2 screens = 30 - 16 = 14 cells.
     - 12 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining 14 cells.
     - Total screens needed = 2.
   - For the last test case (0 9):
     - 9 2x2 icons take 36 cells, so they need 5 screens (since 36 cells > 15, 5 screens are required).
     - No 1x1 icons to place.
     - Total screens needed = 5.

The program seems to handle these cases correctly. Let's verify with the provided output for all test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required for the given test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for the given test cases by first allocating screens for 2x2 icons and then checking if the remaining cells are sufficient for 1x1 icons. If not, it allocates additional screens for the 1x1 icons.
Correctness: **True**
