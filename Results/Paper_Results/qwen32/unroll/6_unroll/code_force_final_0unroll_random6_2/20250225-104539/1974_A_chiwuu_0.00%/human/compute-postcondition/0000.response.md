Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99) where `x` is the number of 1x1 application icons and `y` is the number of 2x2 application icons. `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of the first input, which is the integer `t` representing the number of test cases. The other variables (`t`, `x`, and `y`) are not affected by this line of code.
