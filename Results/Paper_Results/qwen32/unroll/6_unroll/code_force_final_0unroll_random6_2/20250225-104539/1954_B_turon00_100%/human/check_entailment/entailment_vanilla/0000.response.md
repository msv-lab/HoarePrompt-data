Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem asks us to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element with its neighbors if they are equal.

### Key Observations:
1. **Identical Arrays:** If the array consists of identical elements, it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements, so the answer should be -1.
2. **Non-identical Arrays:** If the array has segments of identical elements separated by different elements, the minimum number of elements to remove is the length of the longest segment of identical elements minus one (since removing all but one element of the longest segment will make the array non-beautiful).

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array and counting segments of identical elements. It keeps track of the length of the longest segment (`ans`) and updates it whenever a different element is encountered. If the longest segment is the entire array, it returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the length of the longest segment minus one.

### Issues in the Provided Solution:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Segments:**
   - The solution only considers the longest segment of identical elements and does not correctly handle cases where multiple segments of the same length exist.
   - For example, in the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the solution will incorrectly identify the longest segment as `[3, 3, 3]` at the beginning, but the correct answer is 3, as removing three `3`s will make the array non-beautiful.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution does not correctly handle arrays with multiple segments of the same length.
   - The solution does not correctly handle arrays where the longest segment is not at the beginning or end of the array.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the length of the longest segment of identical elements and return its length minus one, unless the array is entirely composed of the same element, in which case we return -1.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases, particularly those involving multiple segments of the same length. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
