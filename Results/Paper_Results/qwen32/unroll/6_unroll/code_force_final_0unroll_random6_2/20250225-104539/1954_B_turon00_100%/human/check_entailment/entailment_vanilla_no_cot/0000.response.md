Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Logic for Determining the Minimum Number of Elements to Remove:**
   - The program attempts to find the longest sequence of identical elements and then removes all but one element from this sequence. However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting array will not be beautiful.
   - The program does not account for the possibility of multiple sequences of identical elements that could be affected by the removal of elements.
   - The program does not consider the possibility of removing elements in a way that breaks the pattern of the array without necessarily removing the longest sequence of identical elements.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program fails to handle cases where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing fewer than the longest sequence of identical elements.
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where the array is already non-beautiful or where removing a single element can make it non-beautiful.

3. **Output for Specific Test Cases:**
   - For the test case `7 3 3 3 5 3 3 3`, the program outputs `3`, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be `1` because removing the `5` makes the array non-beautiful.

To correctly solve this problem, one would need to consider the structure of the array and how removing elements affects the ability to make all elements the same using the specified operation. This might involve more complex logic, such as dynamic programming or careful analysis of the array's structure.
