### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by identifying the shortest contiguous subarray in the array `a` that contains all elements of the same value. The idea is that by removing all elements of this subarray, the array `a` will stop being beautiful.

However, there are a few issues with the logic used in the program:

1. **Incorrect Approach**: The program only considers contiguous subarrays of the same element and finds the shortest one. This is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. The correct approach should consider the structure of the array and how the operation defined in the problem can be applied.

2. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles the case where all elements are the same or when the array has only one element. However, it does not correctly handle other cases where the array can be made not beautiful by removing a specific number of elements.

3. **Logic Flaw**: The program does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. It only finds the shortest contiguous subarray of the same element, which is not necessarily the correct answer.

For example, consider the array `1 2 1 2 1`. The shortest contiguous subarray of the same element is of length 1 (e.g., any single `1` or `2`), but removing one element (e.g., the middle `1`) makes the array `1 2 1 2`, which is not beautiful. The program would incorrectly output `-1` instead of `1`.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the program is not correct for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
