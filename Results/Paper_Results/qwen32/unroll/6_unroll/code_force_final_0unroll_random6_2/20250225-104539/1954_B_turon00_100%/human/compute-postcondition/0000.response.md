Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 3 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the integer input, but the other variables (`n` and `a`) and their constraints remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
