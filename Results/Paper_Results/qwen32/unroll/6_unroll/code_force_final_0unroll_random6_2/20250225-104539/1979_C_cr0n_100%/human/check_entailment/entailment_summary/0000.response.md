### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to distribute a certain number of coins across `n` outcomes such that, for any winning outcome `i`, the amount received (bet * `k_i`) is strictly greater than the total amount bet across all outcomes.
   - Each bet `x_i` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 10^9).

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - `func_1(a, b)` computes the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
   - The formula used is `a * b // gcd(a, b)`, which is a standard method for computing the LCM.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - `func_2()` reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals`.
   - It calculates the LCM of all multipliers using `func_1`.
   - It then computes a list `vprod` where each element is the LCM divided by each respective multiplier.
   - The sum of `vprod` is subtracted from the LCM to get `den`.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution is possible.
   - Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as the bets.

4. **Verifying the Solution:**
   - The key idea here is to ensure that the total bet (`sum(vprod)`) is less than the amount received for any winning outcome (`k_i * vprod[i]`).
   - By construction, `k_i * vprod[i] = LCM` for all `i`. Since `sum(vprod) < LCM` (because `den = LCM - sum(vprod) > 0`), the condition is satisfied.
   - Each `vprod[i]` is a positive integer because it is the LCM divided by a positive integer `k_i`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The solution correctly computes a valid distribution of bets if possible.
   - If no valid distribution exists, it correctly returns `-1`.
