Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts an integer `N` representing the number of outcomes, where 1 <= N <= 50, and a list `vals` of integers where each integer `k_i` represents the multiplier for the i-th outcome, with 2 <= k_i <= 20, and the length of `vals` equal to `N`. The function returns `None`.**
