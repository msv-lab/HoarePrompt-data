This problem description does not match the provided function definition `def lcm(a, b):`. The correct function definition should be related to the problem description. However, based on the problem description, the input variables are as follows: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, `n` is an integer representing the number of outcomes (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). `k` is a list of integers representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
