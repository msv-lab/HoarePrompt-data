Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`.**

In simpler terms, the initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged. The new variables `l` and `r` are introduced with `l` set to 0 and `r` set to `n - 1`.
