Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, if `n` is 2, it outputs the minimum value in the list `a`. Otherwise, it finds and outputs the maximum median value among all contiguous subarrays of length 3 in the list `a`.**
