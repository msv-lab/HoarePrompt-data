Reasoning:  
The provided Python program aims to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array `a` for each test case. A pair `(i, j)` is considered beautiful if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

The program uses dictionaries to keep track of the counts of remainders when elements of the array are divided by `x` and `y`. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: For each test case, initialize a count to zero and two dictionaries (`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`) to store the counts of remainders.
2. **Iteration over array elements**: For each element `num` in the array:
   - Calculate `mod_x = -num % x` and `mod_y = num % y`. The idea here is that if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`, then `(a_i % x) + (a_j % x) == 0 (mod x)`, which is equivalent to `a_i % x == -a_j % x (mod x)`. Similarly, `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y` if `(a_i % y) - (a_j % y) == 0 (mod y)`, which is equivalent to `a_i % y == a_j % y (mod y)`.
   - Increment the count by the values stored in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for `mod_x` and `mod_y` respectively.
   - Update `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` with the current element's remainders.
3. **Result storage**: Append the count of beautiful pairs for the current test case to the results list.
4. **Output**: Print the results for all test cases.

The logic seems correct based on the problem description. However, there is a subtle issue with the calculation of `mod_x`. The correct calculation should be `mod_x = num % x` (not `-num % x`), as we are interested in the positive remainder when `num` is divided by `x`. The current implementation incorrectly uses `-num % x`, which would lead to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
