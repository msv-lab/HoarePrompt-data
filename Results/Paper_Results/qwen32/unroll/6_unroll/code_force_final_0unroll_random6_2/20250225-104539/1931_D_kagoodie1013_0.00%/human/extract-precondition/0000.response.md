Precondition: **test_cases is a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers (a). Specifically, for each test case, 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and the list a contains n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The total number of elements across all arrays in all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
