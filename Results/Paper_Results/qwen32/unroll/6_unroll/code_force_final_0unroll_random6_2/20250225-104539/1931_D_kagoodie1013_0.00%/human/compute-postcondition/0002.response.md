To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand the operations being performed in each iteration of the loop.

The loop iterates over each test case in the `test_cases` list. For each test case, it initializes a `count` variable to 0, and two dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` to keep track of the frequency of remainders when the numbers in the array `arr` are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.

In each iteration of the inner loop, for each number `num` in `arr`:
- It calculates `mod_x` as `-num % x` and `mod_y` as `num % y`.
- It updates the `count` by adding the current frequency of `-num % x` in `mod_x_map` and `num % y` in `mod_y_map`.
- It then updates the frequency of `num % x` in `mod_x_map` and `num % y` in `mod_y_map`.

Finally, it appends the `count` to the `results` list.

Since the initial state of `results` is an empty list, after all iterations, `results` will contain the `count` value for each test case.

Here's how the output state would look:

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers (a); `results` is a list containing the count of pairs for each test case.**

To make it more understandable in natural language:
Output State: **`test_cases` remains unchanged as a list of test cases; `results` is a list where each element is the count of specific pairs calculated for each test case.**
