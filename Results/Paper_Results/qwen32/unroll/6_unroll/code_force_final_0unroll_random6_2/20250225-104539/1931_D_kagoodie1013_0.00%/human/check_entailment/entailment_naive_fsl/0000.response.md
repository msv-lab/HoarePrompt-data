Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided contains a logical error in the calculation of `mod_x`. Specifically, the line `mod_x = -num % x` is incorrect. The correct approach should be to calculate `mod_x` as `num % x` and then check the conditions based on these modulo values.

The current implementation uses `-num % x`, which is not equivalent to how the problem description defines the conditions for a beautiful pair. The conditions for a beautiful pair are:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\), which can be checked using \((a_i \% x + a_j \% x) \% x == 0\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\), which can be checked using \((a_i \% y - a_j \% y) \% y == 0\).

The current code incorrectly uses `-num % x` which does not align with these conditions. Instead, it should use `num % x` and `num % y` for both elements of the pair and check the conditions accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, x, y) = map(int, data[index:index + 3])
    index += 3
    arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))

def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        mod_x_map = {}
        mod_y_map = {}
        for num in arr:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            count += mod_x_map.get((-mod_x % x), 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
            mod_x_map[mod_x] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + 1
            mod_y_map[mod_y] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) + 1
        results.append(count)
    return results

results = func_1(test_cases)
print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))
```

In this corrected version, `mod_x` is calculated as `num % x` and the condition for `a_i + a_j` being divisible by `x` is checked using `(-mod_x % x)`. This ensures that the conditions for a beautiful pair are correctly evaluated.
