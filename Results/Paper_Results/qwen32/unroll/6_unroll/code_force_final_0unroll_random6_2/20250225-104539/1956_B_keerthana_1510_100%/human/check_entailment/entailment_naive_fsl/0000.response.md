Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally. The current program simply calculates the difference between the total number of cards you have and the number of unique cards you have, which does not account for the strategic gameplay described in the problem.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Game Strategy**: The game involves strategic decisions where both players try to maximize their points. Nene always plays optimally to maximize her points and minimize yours. The current program does not simulate this strategy at all.

2. **Logic Mismatch**: The program calculates the number of non-unique cards you have (`len(tokens) - len({*tokens})`), which is not directly related to the number of points you can score. The number of points depends on the sequence of moves and the state of the table during the game.

3. **No Simulation of Game Turns**: The program does not simulate the turns of the game, where each player places cards and scores points based on the presence of cards on the table.

4. **No Handling of Opponent's Optimal Play**: The program does not account for Nene's optimal play, which is critical to determining the maximum points you can score.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to simulate the game, taking into account the strategic decisions made by both players. This involves simulating the turns, keeping track of the cards on the table, and calculating the points based on the rules provided.

Here's an example of an input that the current program would not handle correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1 1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Current Program Output:**
```
1
```

While the current program happens to give the correct output for this specific example, it does not guarantee correctness for all possible inputs due to the lack of proper game simulation and strategic decision-making. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
