### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several critical flaws in the provided program. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Game Strategy and Simulation**:
   - The game involves strategic moves by both players. The provided program does not simulate the turns or the strategic decisions made by either player. It merely counts the number of duplicate cards in the player's hand, which is not sufficient to determine the maximum points the player can achieve given the optimal play by Nene.

2. **Logic Mismatch**:
   - The logic in the program calculates the number of duplicate cards in the player's hand (`len(tokens) - len({*tokens})`). This value does not directly translate to the number of points the player can score. The points are awarded based on the sequence of moves and the state of the table during the game.

3. **No Simulation of Game Turns**:
   - The provided program does not simulate the turns of the game. It does not keep track of the cards on the table or update the points based on the rules of the game.

4. **No Handling of Opponent's Optimal Play**:
   - The program does not account for Nene's optimal play. Nene plays to maximize her score and minimize the player's score, which is a critical aspect of the problem that the program does not address.

### Example Analysis:

Let's consider the example provided in the problem description:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1 1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

While the current program outputs `1` for this specific example, this is purely coincidental. The program does not correctly simulate the game and the strategic play required to determine the maximum points the player can score.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of points the player can get by playing optimally. It merely counts the number of duplicate cards in the player's hand, which is not sufficient to solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
