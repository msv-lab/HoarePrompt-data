Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is an empty list.**

The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, with the constraint 2 <= n <= 10^5. The variable `path` is initialized as an empty list.
