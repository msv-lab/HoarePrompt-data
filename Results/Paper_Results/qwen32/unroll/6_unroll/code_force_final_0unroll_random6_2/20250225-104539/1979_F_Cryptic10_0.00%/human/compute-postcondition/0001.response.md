Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n.**

Natural Language: The variable `n` retains its original value, representing the number of vertices in the graph. The `path` list remains empty. A new variable `remaining_vertices` is introduced as a set containing all integers from 1 to `n`.
