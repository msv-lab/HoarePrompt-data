To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to evaluate the condition `while remaining_vertices:`. The loop will execute as long as `remaining_vertices` is not an empty set.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5.
- `path` is an empty list.
- `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n.

The condition `while remaining_vertices:` will be true as long as `remaining_vertices` contains at least one element. Since `remaining_vertices` is initially a set containing integers from 1 to n, and n is guaranteed to be at least 2, `remaining_vertices` will not be empty.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed to the state of `remaining_vertices` to ensure the loop can execute the first time. The state right before the loop already satisfies the condition for the loop to start.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n.**
