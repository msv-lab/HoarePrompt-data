To determine the output state, we need to understand the given conditions and the provided code. 

Initial State:
- `extroverts` is a non-negative integer.
- `universals` is a non-negative integer.
- If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, then `extroverts % 3 + universals` is greater than or equal to 3.

The code provided is:
```python
return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)
```

Let's analyze the possible scenarios:

1. If `extroverts` is divisible by 3, then `extroverts % 3` equals 0, and the result of the return statement is `ceil(universals / 3)`.
2. If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, then `extroverts % 3` is either 1 or 2, and the condition `extroverts % 3 + universals >= 3` must hold true. This means that the result of the return statement is `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

In both cases, the result of the return statement is the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3.

Output State: **The program returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3.**
