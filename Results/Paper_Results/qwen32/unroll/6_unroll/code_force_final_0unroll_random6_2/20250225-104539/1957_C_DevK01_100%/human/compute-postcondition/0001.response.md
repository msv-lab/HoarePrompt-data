In the provided for loop:

```python
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop iterates over the variable `i` starting from 2 up to `n` (inclusive). The only variables in the loop head that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

To ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be at least 2. If `n` is less than 2, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute. The initial value of `i` does not need to be set before the loop starts because the `range` function in Python will automatically start `i` at 2.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure `n` is at least 2.

State: **`dp` is `[1, 1]`, `n` must be at least 2**
