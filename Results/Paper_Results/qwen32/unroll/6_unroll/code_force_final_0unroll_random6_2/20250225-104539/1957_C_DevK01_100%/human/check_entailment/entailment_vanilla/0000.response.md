Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Game Rules**:
   - You and the computer take turns placing rooks on an n x n chessboard.
   - You place white rooks, and the computer places black rooks.
   - No two rooks can attack each other (i.e., no two rooks in the same row or column).
   - After you place a rook at (r, c), the computer mirrors your move by placing a rook at (c, r), unless r = c, in which case the computer skips its turn.
   - We are given `k` moves that have already been made, and we need to find the number of different final configurations possible after all moves are finished.

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine the number of different final configurations possible after the game concludes, given `n` and `k` as well as the `k` moves already made.
   - The answer should be printed modulo 10^9 + 7.

3. **Constraints**:
   - Multiple test cases (up to 10^4).
   - Large board sizes (up to 3 * 10^5).
   - The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then reads `k` pairs of integers representing the moves already made.

2. **Logic to Calculate Remaining Moves**:
   - For each move (r, c):
     - If `r != c`, then both `r` and `c` are occupied and can no longer be used, hence `n -= 2`.
     - If `r == c`, then only that row/column is occupied, so `n -= 1`.

3. **Function `func_1(n)`**:
   - This function calculates the number of different final configurations for a board of size `n` after all moves have been made.
   - It uses dynamic programming (DP) to compute the configurations:
     - `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks on an i x i board.
     - The base cases are `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 1`.
     - The transition formula is `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]`, which is derived from considering the placement of the first rook and the subsequent configurations.
     - The result is computed modulo 10^9 + 7.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the result of `func_1(n)` after adjusting `n` based on the moves already made.

### Verification

- The logic to adjust `n` based on the moves is correct.
- The DP function `func_1(n)` seems to correctly compute the number of configurations based on the problem's constraints and transition formula.
- The program handles multiple test cases efficiently within the given constraints.

### Conclusion

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem according to the given requirements and constraints.

Reasoning: The program correctly parses the input, adjusts the board size based on the moves already made, and uses a dynamic programming approach to compute the number of possible final configurations. It handles multiple test cases and outputs the correct results modulo 10^9 + 7.

Correctness: **True**
