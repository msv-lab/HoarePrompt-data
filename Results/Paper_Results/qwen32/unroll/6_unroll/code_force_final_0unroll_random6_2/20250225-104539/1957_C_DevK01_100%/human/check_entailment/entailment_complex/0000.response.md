Reasoning: The program is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not correctly compute the number of different final configurations based on the provided problem description. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the number of possible configurations based on the size of the board `n` after `k` moves, but it always returns 25, regardless of the input `n`. This is clearly not the intended behavior as per the problem statement, which requires calculating the number of configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The function `func_1` seems to be using a dynamic programming approach, but it is not implemented correctly to solve the problem of counting the number of valid configurations of rooks on the chessboard. The function should consider the number of remaining rows and columns where rooks can be placed after `k` moves and compute the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions.

Since the function `func_1` does not perform the necessary calculations and always returns the same value, the program cannot be considered correct.

Correctness: **False**
