### Reasoning:
The provided program has several issues that need to be addressed to determine its correctness:

1. **Function Definition and Parameters**: The function `func_1` is incorrectly defined and does not take into account the necessary parameters. The function should consider the number of remaining valid positions on the board after the initial `k` moves.

2. **Logic for Remaining Positions**: The logic for determining the number of remaining valid positions on the board is incorrect. The program decreases `n` by 1 or 2 based on whether the move is on the diagonal or not. However, this does not correctly account for the fact that each move eliminates not just one but potentially multiple positions from future moves.

3. **Combinatorial Calculation**: The function `func_1` attempts to calculate the number of configurations using a dynamic programming approach, but the logic is flawed. The provided dynamic programming formula does not correctly calculate the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining board positions.

4. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation is correctly applied in the dynamic programming formula, but the formula itself is incorrect.

Given these issues, the program cannot correctly compute the number of different final configurations for the given problem.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` is incorrectly defined and does not accurately compute the number of possible final configurations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
