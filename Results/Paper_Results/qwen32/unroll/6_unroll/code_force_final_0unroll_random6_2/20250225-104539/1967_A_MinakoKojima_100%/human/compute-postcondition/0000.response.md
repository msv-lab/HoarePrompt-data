The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `ans_list`. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `a`. The only change is the creation of `ans_list`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` is such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^12; `ans_list` is an empty list.**
