Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum score based on the problem description. The logic for distributing the additional cards and calculating the score is flawed. Specifically, the program does not properly account for the requirement to form permutations of the sequence [1, 2, ..., n] within the rearranged cards. The program's logic for handling the differences between card counts and distributing the additional cards does not guarantee the optimal arrangement to maximize the number of such permutations.

A correct solution would involve a different approach, possibly using a greedy strategy or dynamic programming to determine the optimal distribution of additional cards to maximize the number of valid permutations.
