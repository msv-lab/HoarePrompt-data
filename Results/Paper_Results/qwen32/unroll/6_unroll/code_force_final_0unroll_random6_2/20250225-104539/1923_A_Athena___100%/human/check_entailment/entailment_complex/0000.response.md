### Reasoning:
The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of operations required to move chips into a single contiguous block without any free cells between them. The key insight is that the minimum number of operations is equal to the number of free cells (0s) between the first and last chip (1s), excluding any leading and trailing free cells.

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells, `n`, and the list of cells, `a`, which contains either `0` (free cell) or `1` (cell with a chip).

2. **Trimming Leading and Trailing Zeros**:
   - The program removes any leading zeros from the list `a` using a `while` loop that pops the first element as long as it is `0`.
   - Similarly, it removes any trailing zeros using another `while` loop that pops the last element as long as it is `0`.

3. **Counting Zeros Between Chips**:
   - After trimming, the program iterates through the list `a` and counts the number of zeros, which represent the gaps between chips that need to be filled by moving chips.
   - The count of these zeros is stored in the variable `res`.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the value of `res`, which is the minimum number of operations needed.

### Verification with Examples:
Let's verify the program logic with the provided examples:

- **First Test Case**:
  - Input: `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
  - Trimmed: `1 1 1 0 1 1`
  - Zeros between chips: `1`
  - Output: `1`

- **Second Test Case**:
  - Input: `0 1 0 0 0 0`
  - Trimmed: `1`
  - Zeros between chips: `0`
  - Output: `0`

- **Third Test Case**:
  - Input: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Trimmed: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Zeros between chips: `0`
  - Output: `0`

- **Fourth Test Case**:
  - Input: `1 0 1 0 1`
  - Trimmed: `1 0 1 0 1`
  - Zeros between chips: `2`
  - Output: `2`

- **Fifth Test Case**:
  - Input: `0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
  - Trimmed: `1 1 0 0 0 1 1`
  - Zeros between chips: `3`
  - Output: `3`

All the examples match the expected output, confirming that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block of chips.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Thus, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
