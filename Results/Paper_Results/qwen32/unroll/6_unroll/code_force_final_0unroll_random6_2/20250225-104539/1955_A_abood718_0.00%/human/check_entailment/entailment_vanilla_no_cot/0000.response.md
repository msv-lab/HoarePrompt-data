Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect due to a mistake in the logic of the last conditional branch. Specifically, the line `print(X)` is unnecessary and incorrect in this context. Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)

func()
```

Explanation of the logic:
- If the price of two yogurts bought individually (2 * a) is less than the promotion price (b), then it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually.
- If the number of yogurts (A) is even, then it's always cheaper to buy them in pairs using the promotion.
- If the number of yogurts (A) is odd, then Maxim should buy as many pairs as possible (A // 2) using the promotion and then buy the remaining yogurt individually.
