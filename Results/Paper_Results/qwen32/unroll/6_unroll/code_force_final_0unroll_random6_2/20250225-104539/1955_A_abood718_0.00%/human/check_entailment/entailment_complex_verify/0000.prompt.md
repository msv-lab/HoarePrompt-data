You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: a series of printed values based on the conditions for each test case, with variables t, n, a, and b unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by three integers. For each test case, it prints a value based on specific conditions involving the integers. The integers representing the number of test cases and the values for each test case remain unchanged after the function executes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a logical error that causes it to not produce the correct output for certain cases. Let's analyze the code and identify the issue:

The code reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the values of `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts under promotion). The logic in the code is as follows:

1. If the price of two yogurts (`b`) is greater than twice the price of one yogurt (`2*a`), then the code simply multiplies the number of yogurts (`A`) by the price of one yogurt (`B`) and prints the result.
2. If the number of yogurts (`A`) is even, it calculates the cost by multiplying the number of pairs of yogurts (`A // 2`) by the promotion price (`C`) and prints the result.
3. If the number of yogurts (`A`) is odd, it calculates the cost for the pairs and then adds the cost of one more yogurt at the regular price. However, there is an issue in this part of the code.

In the case where the number of yogurts is odd, the code incorrectly prints the value of `X` (which is `A // 2`) before calculating the final cost. Additionally, the code does not correctly calculate the final cost in this case. It should be calculated as `X * C + B` and then printed, but the current code has a print statement before the calculation, which results in incorrect output.

Let's consider a test case to illustrate this issue:

**Test case:**
```
1
3 5 11
```
**Expected output:**
```
15
```
**Actual output:**
```
1
16
```
Here, the code incorrectly prints `1` (which is `X` or `A // 2`), and then `16` (which is `X * C + B`), instead of just `15`.

To fix the code, the print statement before the final calculation should be removed. Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)

```

With this correction, the code should work as expected for all cases. However, the original code provided has the issue mentioned above, so it is considered incorrect.
