### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Breakdown:
- **Input:** 
  - `t`: Number of test cases.
  - For each test case, three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts with promotion).

- **Output:**
  - Minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts for each test case.

- **Logic:**
  - If buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than the promotion price (`b`), then buy all yogurts at the regular price.
  - Otherwise, buy as many pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (`b`), and if there is an odd yogurt left, buy it at the regular price (`a`).

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the input and applies the following logic:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)
```

- **Variable Mapping:**
  - `A` corresponds to `n` (number of yogurts).
  - `B` corresponds to `a` (price of one yogurt).
  - `C` corresponds to `b` (price of two yogurts with promotion).

- **Logic Analysis:**
  - **Condition `if B * 2 < C`:** This condition is incorrect. It should be `if 2 * B < C` (i.e., `if 2 * a < b`). The condition is checking if buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than the promotion price.
  - **Condition `elif A % 2 == 0`:** This correctly checks if the number of yogurts is even. If true, it calculates the cost as `(A // 2) * C` (i.e., `(n // 2) * b`).
  - **Else Block:** If the number of yogurts is odd, it calculates the cost as `(A // 2) * C + B` (i.e., `(n // 2) * b + a`). However, it incorrectly prints `X` (which is `A // 2`) before printing the final cost.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary states that the function processes a series of test cases and prints a value based on specific conditions. The summary does not mention any issues with the logic or the output format.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The condition `if B * 2 < C` is incorrect. It should be `if 2 * B < C`.
- The else block incorrectly prints `X` before the final cost, which is not expected as per the problem description.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
The provided program contains logical errors and incorrect variable usage. As a result, it does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Final: False**
