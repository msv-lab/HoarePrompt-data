The code assigns the value of `start_pos` to `current_pos`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `start_pos` is an integer such that 1 <= `start_pos` <= n, `score` is 0, and `current_pos` is equal to `start_pos`.

Output State: **`start_pos` is an integer such that 1 <= `start_pos` <= n, `score` is 0, `current_pos` is equal to `start_pos`.**
