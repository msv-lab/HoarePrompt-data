Reasoning: The given program and its function `func_1(a, b)` are not correctly implementing the logic required by the problem statement. The task is to determine whether it is possible to cut the rectangle of size `a x b` into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange those smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle that is different from the original one.

The program currently only checks if `b` is even and returns 'yes' if it is, and 'no' otherwise. This check is not sufficient to determine whether another rectangle can be formed. The key point is that the smaller rectangles formed by the cut must be able to be rearranged into a different rectangle.

For example, a `2 x 6` rectangle can be cut into two `2 x 3` rectangles, which can then be rearranged into a `3 x 4` rectangle. However, a `2 x 1` rectangle can only be cut into two `1 x 1` rectangles, which can only form a `2 x 1` rectangle (or `1 x 2`, which is considered the same).

The correct logic should check if either `a` or `b` can be divided into two parts such that the resulting smaller rectangles can be rearranged into a new rectangle. This can be achieved if either `a` or `b` is even because an even dimension can always be split into two equal parts, allowing for the rearrangement into a new rectangle.

Thus, the correct condition should be checking if either `a` or `b` is even, not just `b`.

Correctness: **False**
