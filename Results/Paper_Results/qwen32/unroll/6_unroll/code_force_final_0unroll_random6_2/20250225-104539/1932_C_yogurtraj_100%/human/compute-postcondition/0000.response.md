The only variable in the loop head is `ii`, which is the loop variable for the `for` loop. The loop iterates over the range determined by `int(input())`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes, the input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer.

Given the state before the loop starts, the only state we can adjust is the value of `t` because it is the only variable mentioned that can influence the number of iterations (since `t` is described as "an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4" and it likely represents the number of test cases, which corresponds to the number of iterations of the loop).

To ensure that the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. 

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5 and 1 <= m <= 10^4, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^4, `s` is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R', the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5**
