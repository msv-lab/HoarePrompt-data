You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Length of the array `a`.
     - `m`: Modulus value.
     - `a`: Array of `n` integers.
     - `s`: String of `n` commands ('L' or 'R').

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output `n` integers where each integer is the remainder of the product of the current array `a` modulo `m` before processing each command.

3. **Processing:**
   - For each command in `s`:
     - Print the remainder of the product of the current array `a` modulo `m`.
     - If the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element.
     - If the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the product of the array elements modulo `m` in a specific order to avoid recalculating the entire product from scratch after each removal. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`.
   - It counts the number of 'L' commands (`l`).
   - It initializes `k`, `q1`, and `q2` based on whether the last command is 'L' or 'R'. These variables are intended to help in calculating the product modulo `m` in reverse order.

2. **Reverse Calculation:**
   - The program initializes an output array `y` of size `n` with all zeros.
   - It sets the last element of `y` to the appropriate value based on the last command.
   - It then iterates from the second last element to the first element of `y`, updating the product `k` based on the command and the corresponding array element.

3. **Updating Product:**
   - If the command is 'R', it multiplies `k` by the next element from the right (`a[q2]`), updates `q2`, and stores the result in `y`.
   - If the command is 'L', it multiplies `k` by the next element from the left (`a[q1]`), updates `q1`, and stores the result in `y`.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Initialization of `k`, `q1`, and `q2`:**
   - The initialization of `k`, `q1`, and `q2` is incorrect. The program assumes the product can be initialized based on the last command, but this does not necessarily hold true for all cases.
   - For example, if the last command is 'L', `k` is set to `a[l - 1] % m`, but this does not account for the product of all elements before the last 'L'.

2. **Incorrect Indexing:**
   - The indices `q1` and `q2` are not correctly updated to reflect the elements that should be included in the product calculation.
   - The logic for updating `k` based on the commands is flawed because it does not correctly track which elements are included in the product.

3. **Reverse Calculation Flaw:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the product in reverse order, but the reverse calculation logic is incorrect and does not accurately reflect the product of the array elements at each step.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to compute the product modulo `m` for each command. The initialization and indexing issues result in incorrect outputs for many test cases.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
