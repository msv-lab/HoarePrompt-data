Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the required remainders. The logic for updating the product and indices is flawed, and the initial conditions for `q1` and `q2` are not set up properly to reflect the correct behavior of the commands.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Initialization of `q1` and `q2`:** The indices `q1` and `q2` are not correctly initialized to reflect the positions of the elements that need to be multiplied next based on the commands.

2. **Logic for updating the product:** The program incorrectly updates the product `k` by multiplying it with elements from the wrong indices, leading to incorrect remainders.

3. **Order of operations:** The program attempts to compute the remainders in reverse order, which is not necessary and complicates the logic.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        commands = input().strip()
        
        left_product = 1
        right_product = 1
        left_products = [1] * n
        right_products = [1] * n
        
        for i in range(n):
            left_product = (left_product * a[i]) % m
            left_products[i] = left_product
        
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            right_product = (right_product * a[i]) % m
            right_products[i] = right_product
        
        result = []
        left_index = 0
        right_index = n - 1
        
        for command in commands:
            if command == 'L':
                if left_index < right_index:
                    result.append(right_products[left_index + 1])
                else:
                    result.append(0)
                left_index += 1
            else:  # command == 'R'
                if left_index < right_index:
                    result.append(left_products[right_index - 1])
                else:
                    result.append(0)
                right_index -= 1
        
        print(*result)

func()
```

This corrected version precomputes the products of elements to the left and right of each position, then uses these precomputed values to efficiently determine the product of the remaining elements after each command.
