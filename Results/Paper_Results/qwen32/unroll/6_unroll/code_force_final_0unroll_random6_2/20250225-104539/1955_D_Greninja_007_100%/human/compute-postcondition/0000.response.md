The code snippet provided creates a `Counter` object from the sorted list `b`. This means that `cb` will be a dictionary-like object where the keys are the unique elements from the sorted list `b`, and the values are the counts of those elements.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. `b` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6. `cb` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`.**

In natural language: The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. The list `a` remains unchanged. The list `b` remains unchanged, but `cb` is now a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in the sorted version of `b`.
