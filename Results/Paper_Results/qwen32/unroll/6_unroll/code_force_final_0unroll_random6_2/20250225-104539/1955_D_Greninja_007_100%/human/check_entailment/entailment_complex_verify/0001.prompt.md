You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to count how many subarrays of length `m` in array `a` can be rearranged to match at least `k` elements of array `b`.

### Program Analysis

The program uses a sliding window approach combined with the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to efficiently count the number of good subarrays.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `cb` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each element in `b`.
   - `ca` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of the first `m` elements in `a`.

2. **Initial Check**:
   - The initial subarray `a[:m]` is checked against `b` to see if it can be rearranged to match at least `k` elements. This is done by computing the intersection of `ca` and `cb` and summing the values, which gives the number of matching elements. If this sum is at least `k`, the initial subarray is counted as good.

3. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program then slides the window one element at a time from the start of `a` to the end.
   - For each new element added to the window (`a[r]`), the program checks if adding this element increases the count of matching elements. If `a[r]` is in `b` and its count in `ca` is less than its count in `cb`, adding it increases the count of matching elements.
   - Similarly, for each element removed from the window (`a[r - m]`), the program checks if removing this element decreases the count of matching elements. If `a[r - m]` is in `b` and its count in `ca` is less than or equal to its count in `cb`, removing it decreases the count of matching elements.
   - After updating the counts, the program checks if the current window can be rearranged to match at least `k` elements of `b`.

### Correctness

The program correctly implements the sliding window approach and efficiently checks each subarray of length `m` in `a` to see if it can be rearranged to match at least `k` elements of `b`. The use of `Counter` objects allows for efficient counting and updating of the number of matching elements.

### Conclusion

The program is correct and handles the problem requirements as described.

Correctness: **True**
