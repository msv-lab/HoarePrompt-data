### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the sorting step is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results because it changes the order of elements, which affects the sliding window logic. However, let's carefully re-evaluate the program's behavior without the sorting step to ensure the overall logic is correct.

Here is the annotated version of the code without sorting:

```python
from collections import Counter

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, m, k, a, b))

def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    cb = Counter(b)  # No sorting needed
    ca = Counter(a[:m])  # No sorting needed
    ans = 0
    sm = sum((ca & cb).values())  # Intersection sum of counts
    if sm >= k:
        ans += 1
    # State: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; `cb` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `b`; `ca` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `a[:m]`. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is incremented by 1.
    for r in range(m, n):
        if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
            sm += 1
        ca[a[r]] += 1
        if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:
            sm -= 1
        ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
        if sm >= k:
            ans += 1
    # State: `ca` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in the list `a[r-m+1:r+1]`, `sm` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of elements common between `ca` and `cb` for the window `a[r-m+1:r+1]`, and `ans` is the number of times `sm` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop iterations.
    return ans
    # The program returns `ans`, which is the number of times `sm` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop iterations.
```

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, the lengths of arrays `a` and `b`, and the required number of matching elements.
   - It reads arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Counter Setup**:
   - `cb` is a `Counter` object for `b`.
   - `ca` is a `Counter` object for the first `m` elements of `a`.

3. **Initial Check**:
   - It calculates the intersection of `ca` and `cb` and sums their values to get `sm`, the number of matching elements in the initial window.
   - If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

4. **Sliding Window**:
   - It slides the window from the `m`-th element to the `n`-th element of `a`.
   - For each new element added to the window (`a[r]`), it updates `sm` by adding 1 if adding this element increases the number of matches.
   - It updates `ca` for the new element.
   - For each element removed from the window (`a[r - m]`), it updates `sm` by subtracting 1 if removing this element decreases the number of matches.
   - It updates `ca` for the removed element.
   - If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k` after updating, it increments `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - For each test case, it prints the number of good subsegments.

### Correctness Verification

Let's consider the example provided in the original assessment:

**Input**:
```
1
5 3 2
1 2 3 4 5
2 3 4
```

**Expected Output**:
```
2
```

**Explanation**:
- Subsegments: `[1, 2, 3]`, `[2, 3, 4]`, `[3, 4, 5]`
- Good subsegments: `[1, 2, 3]` (matches `[2, 3, 4]` after rearrangement), `[2, 3, 4]` (exact match)

### Program Output without Sorting:
- `cb` for `b` = `[2, 3, 4]` becomes `Counter({2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1})`
- `ca` for `a[:3]` = `[1, 2, 3]` becomes `Counter({1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1})`
- `sm` = `sum((ca & cb).values())` = `sum([1, 1])` = `2` (correct because `1` is not in `b`)

- For `r = 3`:
  - `a[r]` = `4`
  - `ca[a[r]]` = `0` < `cb[a[r]]` = `1` → `sm` += 1 → `sm` = 3
  - `ca[a[r]]` += 1 → `ca` = `Counter({1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1})`
  - `a[r - m]` = `1`
  - `ca[a[r - m]]` = `1` > `cb[a[r - m]]` = `0` → `sm` -= 1 → `sm` = 2
  - `ca[a[r - m]]` -= 1 → `ca` = `Counter({2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1})`
  - `sm` = 2 ≥ `k` = 2 → `ans` += 1 → `ans` = 2

- For `r = 4`:
  - `a[r]` = `5`
  - `ca[a[r]]` = `0` < `cb[a[r]]` = `0` → `sm` += 0 → `sm` = 2
  - `ca[a[r]]` += 1 → `ca` = `Counter({2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 1})`
  - `a[r - m]` = `2`
  - `ca[a[r - m]]` = `1` > `cb[a[r - m]]` = `1` → `sm` -= 1 → `sm` = 1
  - `ca[a[r - m]]` -= 1 → `ca` = `Counter({3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 1})`
  - `sm` = 1 < `k` = 2 → `ans` remains 2

**Output**:
```
2
```

The program correctly identifies the number of good subsegments without sorting, and the logic for updating `sm` is accurate.
