### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify its correctness step by step.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with these parameters.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function first creates a `Counter` object `cb` for the sorted list `b` and `ca` for the first `m` elements of `a`.
   - It calculates the intersection of `ca` and `cb` and sums the values of their intersection, which represents the number of common elements between the first `m` elements of `a` and `b`.
   - If this sum is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans` by 1.
   - It then slides the window over the array `a` from position `m` to `n-1`:
     - If adding the new element `a[r]` to the window increases the number of common elements (i.e., `ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]`), it increments the sum `sm` by 1.
     - It updates the count of `a[r]` in `ca`.
     - If removing the element `a[r - m]` from the window decreases the number of common elements (i.e., `ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]`), it decrements the sum `sm` by 1.
     - It updates the count of `a[r - m]` in `ca`.
     - If the updated sum `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans` by 1.

3. **Sorting and Counter**:
   - The program sorts `b` before creating the `Counter` object `cb`. However, sorting `b` is unnecessary because the `Counter` object will count the occurrences of each element regardless of their order.
   - Sorting `a[:m]` before creating the `Counter` object `ca` is also unnecessary for the same reason.
   - Removing the sorting steps does not affect the logic of the program.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The logic of the function `func_1` correctly implements the sliding window technique to count the number of subsegments of `a` of length `m` that have at least `k` common elements with `b`.
   - The function efficiently updates the count of common elements as the window slides over `a` using the `Counter` objects.
   - The function correctly handles the edge cases, such as when all subsegments are good or when no subsegments are good.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it accurately implements the required logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
