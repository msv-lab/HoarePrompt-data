Let's analyze the provided loop to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations.

### Initial State:
- `N` is the number of test cases (not directly used in the loop, so it remains unchanged).
- `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers, including `0`.
- `ls` is initialized to `0`.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over each element in the `nums` list. In each iteration:
1. The current element `nums[i]` is reduced by the value of `ls`.
2. The value of `ls` is then incremented by the new value of `nums[i]`.

### Step-by-Step Execution:
Let's consider a small example to understand the transformation:
- Suppose `nums = [0, 1, 2, 3]` and `ls = 0`.

**Iteration 1 (i=0):**
- `nums[0] = 0 - ls = 0 - 0 = 0`
- `ls = ls + nums[0] = 0 + 0 = 0`

**Iteration 2 (i=1):**
- `nums[1] = 1 - ls = 1 - 0 = 1`
- `ls = ls + nums[1] = 0 + 1 = 1`

**Iteration 3 (i=2):**
- `nums[2] = 2 - ls = 2 - 1 = 1`
- `ls = ls + nums[2] = 1 + 1 = 2`

**Iteration 4 (i=3):**
- `nums[3] = 3 - ls = 3 - 2 = 1`
- `ls = ls + nums[3] = 2 + 1 = 3`

After all iterations, `nums` becomes `[0, 1, 1, 1]` and `ls` becomes `3`.

### Generalization:
From the example, we can generalize that:
- The first element of `nums` remains `0` because it is initially `0` and `ls` is `0` at that point.
- Each subsequent element `nums[i]` (for `i > 0`) becomes `1` because `ls` accumulates the sum of the previous elements, which are all `1` after the first iteration.

### Conclusion:
- After the loop, `nums` will be a list where the first element is `0` and all other elements are `1`.
- `ls` will be equal to `len(nums) - 1` because it accumulates the sum of `1`s from the second element to the last element.

### Output State:
Output State: **`nums` is a list where the first element is `0` and all other elements are `1`; `ls` is `len(nums) - 1`.**
