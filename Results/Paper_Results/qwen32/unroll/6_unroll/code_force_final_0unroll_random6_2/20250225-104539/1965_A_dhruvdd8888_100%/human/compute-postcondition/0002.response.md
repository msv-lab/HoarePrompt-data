The code snippet adds the string `'0'` to the set `nums`. This means that after the execution, the set `nums` will include all its previous unique values plus the string `'0'`. The value of `N` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`N` is the number of test cases, which is an integer input (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^4); `nums` is a set containing unique space-separated values from the input line plus the string `'0'`.**
