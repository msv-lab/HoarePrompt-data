The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `N`. This integer `N` represents the number of test cases. The initial state mentions that `N` is an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). After executing the code, `N` will hold the value of the first input integer, which is the number of test cases.

Output State: **`N` is the number of test cases, which is an integer input (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^4).**
