Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^{18}.**

In natural language: `t` has been assigned the value of an input integer within the range of 1 to 1000, inclusive. The conditions for `n` and `k` in each test case remain unchanged.
