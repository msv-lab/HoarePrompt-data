Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:

The task is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) such that the expression \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized. The goal is to output any such \( y \) for each test case.

### Key Observations:

1. **Maximizing \(\gcd(x, y) + y\):**
   - To maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\), we need to consider the relationship between \( x \) and \( y \).
   - The \(\gcd(x, y)\) function will return the largest divisor of \( x \) that is also a divisor of \( y \).
   - A higher value of \( y \) generally increases the sum, but so does a higher \(\gcd(x, y)\).

2. **Choosing \( y = x - 1 \):**
   - When \( y = x - 1 \), \(\gcd(x, y)\) is maximized because \( x \) and \( x-1 \) are consecutive integers, and the only common divisor they can have is 1 (except when \( x = 2 \)).
   - For \( x = 2 \), the only possible \( y \) is 1, and \(\gcd(2, 1) = 1\).
   - For \( x > 2 \), \(\gcd(x, x-1) = 1\), and the expression becomes \( 1 + (x - 1) = x \), which is the maximum possible value for any \( y < x \).

### Program Analysis:

The provided program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads an integer \( x \) and then prints \( y = x - 1 \).

- **Correctness for \( x > 2 \):**
  - As discussed, when \( y = x - 1 \), the expression \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized to \( x \).
  - This satisfies the problem's requirement for \( x > 2 \).

- **Correctness for \( x = 2 \):**
  - For \( x = 2 \), the only possible \( y \) is 1, and the expression becomes \(\gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2\).
  - The program outputs \( y = 1 \), which is correct for \( x = 2 \).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find an integer \( y \) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized. It handles all possible values of \( x \) as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
