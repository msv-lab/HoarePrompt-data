You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

    #State: a series of integers, each representing the result of one test case based on the provided logic.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. It calculates and outputs a result for each test case, which indicates whether it is possible to color a square grid of size `n` such that at least `k` diagonals contain at least one colored cell.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell. The grid has \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Diagonals in the Grid:**
   - The grid has \( n \) diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right (main diagonals).
   - The grid has \( n \) diagonals running from top-right to bottom-left (anti-diagonals).
   - There are \( 2n - 2 \) additional diagonals in total, making it \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals.

2. **Minimum Cells to Color:**
   - If \( k \leq 2n - 1 \), we can color cells such that each cell covers two diagonals (one main and one anti-diagonal). Therefore, the minimum number of cells to color is \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).
   - If \( k > 2n - 1 \), we need to color more cells because we can't cover all diagonals with the optimal two-diagonal-per-cell strategy. In this case, we need to color \( 2n \) cells to ensure that all diagonals are covered.

3. **Special Case:**
   - If \( k = 4n - 2 \), we need to color exactly \( 2n - 1 \) cells because we can cover all diagonals except one by coloring \( 2n - 2 \) cells optimally, and one more cell will be needed to cover the last diagonal.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program is trying to implement the above logic. Let's break it down:

```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))
```

- **Expression Breakdown:**
  - `(k // 2 + k % 2)`: This calculates \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).
  - `(k < 4 * n - 3)`: This is a condition to check if \( k \) is less than \( 4n - 3 \).
  - `2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3)`: This part ensures that if \( k \geq 4n - 3 \), we color \( 2n \) cells.
  - `(k == 4 * n - 2)`: This adds one more cell if \( k = 4n - 2 \).

### Correctness Check:
- **Case 1:** \( k < 4n - 3 \)
  - The program correctly calculates \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) and returns it.
- **Case 2:** \( k \geq 4n - 3 \)
  - The program correctly returns \( 2n \) cells.
- **Special Case:** \( k = 4n - 2 \)
  - The program correctly adds one more cell to the \( 2n \) cells.

The program covers all the cases as per the problem statement and correctly calculates the minimum number of cells to color.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
