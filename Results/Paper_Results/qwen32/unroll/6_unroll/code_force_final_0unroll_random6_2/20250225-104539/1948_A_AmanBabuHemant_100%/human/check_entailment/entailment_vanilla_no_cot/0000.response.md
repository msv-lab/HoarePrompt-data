Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it only considers the case when `n` is even and constructs a string of the form 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. However, it does not handle the case when `n` is odd correctly. The program should be able to construct a valid string for both even and odd values of `n`.

For example, for `n = 1`, the output should be `YES` followed by a string like `AA` or `BB`, where the middle character is special. Similarly, for `n = 2`, the output could be `YES` followed by a string like `AABA` or `BBAC`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('YES')
            print('AA')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if n % 2 == 1:
                s += 'AA'
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version handles both even and odd values of `n` and ensures that the constructed string meets the problem's requirements.
