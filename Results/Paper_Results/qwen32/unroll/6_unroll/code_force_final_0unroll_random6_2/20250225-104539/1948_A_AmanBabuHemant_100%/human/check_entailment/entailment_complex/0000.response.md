### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to construct a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly `n` special characters.
   - A character is considered special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

2. **Special Character Analysis**:
   - For a character to be special, it must be different from one neighbor and the same as the other.
   - For example, in the string "AAABAACC":
     - 'A' at position 1 is special (equal to 'A' at position 2 but not equal to 'A' at position 0, which doesn't exist).
     - 'A' at position 3 is special (equal to 'B' at position 4 but not equal to 'A' at position 2).
     - 'B' at position 4 is special (equal to 'A' at position 3 but not equal to 'A' at position 5).
     - 'A' at position 5 is special (equal to 'A' at position 4 but not equal to 'C' at position 6).
     - 'A' at position 6 is special (equal to 'C' at position 7 but not equal to 'A' at position 5).
     - 'C' at position 7 is special (equal to 'C' at position 8 but not equal to 'A' at position 6).
     - 'C' at position 8 is special (equal to 'A' at position 7 but not equal to 'C' at position 9, which doesn't exist).

3. **Solution Analysis**:
   - The solution provided checks if `n` is even. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters in such a pattern.
   - If `n` is even, it constructs a string by repeating the pattern "AAB" `n // 2` times.
   - The pattern "AAB" has exactly 2 special characters:
     - The middle 'A' is special (equal to the 'B' on the right but not equal to the 'A' on the left).
     - The 'B' is special (equal to the 'A' on the left but not equal to the 'A' on the right).
   - Therefore, repeating "AAB" `n // 2` times results in exactly `n` special characters.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The smallest possible `n` is 1, which is odd. The solution correctly outputs "NO".
   - The largest possible `n` is 50, which is even. The solution constructs a valid string of length 150 (50 // 2 * 3), which is within the limit of 200 characters.

### Conclusion:
The solution correctly handles the problem requirements and edge cases. It ensures that the output string has exactly `n` special characters when `n` is even and correctly reports that no such string exists when `n` is odd.

**Correctness: True**
