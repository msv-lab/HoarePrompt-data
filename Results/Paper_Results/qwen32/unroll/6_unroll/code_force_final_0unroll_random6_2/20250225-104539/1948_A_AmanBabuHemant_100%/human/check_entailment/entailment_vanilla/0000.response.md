Let's analyze the problem and the given program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
1. The task is to construct a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly `n` special characters.
2. A special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
3. The output should either be "NO" if no such string exists, or "YES" followed by a valid string of length at most 200 if it does.

### Key Observations:
- For a character to be special, it must be different from one of its neighbors but the same as the other neighbor.
- This implies that a pattern like "AAB" can be used to create special characters. In "AAB", the first 'A' is special, the second 'A' is not, and the 'B' is special.
- If we use the pattern "AAB" repeatedly, each repetition contributes 2 special characters (the first 'A' and the 'B' in "AAB").
- Therefore, to have exactly `n` special characters, `n` must be even because each "AAB" contributes 2 special characters.

### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.
- If `n` is odd, the program prints "NO" because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters with the "AAB" pattern.
- If `n` is even, the program constructs a string using the "AAB" pattern `n // 2` times.
- The program then checks if the constructed string is of length at most 200. If it is, it prints "YES" followed by the string. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program correctly identifies that `n` must be even to have a valid string.
- The program constructs a string using the "AAB" pattern, which guarantees that the number of special characters is exactly `n` when `n` is even.
- The constructed string is guaranteed to be of length at most 200 because `n` is at most 50, and `n // 2` repetitions of "AAB" (which is 3 characters long) will result in a string of length at most 150.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
