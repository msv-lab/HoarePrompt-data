Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`. It then checks if `n` is even and less than or equal to 100. If so, it outputs 'YES' followed by a string of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. If `n` is odd or the resulting string would be longer than 200 characters, it outputs 'NO'.**
