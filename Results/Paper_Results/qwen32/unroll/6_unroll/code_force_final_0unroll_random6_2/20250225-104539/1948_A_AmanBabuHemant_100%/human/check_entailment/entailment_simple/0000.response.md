Reasoning:  
The program provided attempts to solve the problem by checking if the number of special characters `n` is even. If `n` is odd, it correctly prints "NO" because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where a special character is defined as being equal to exactly one of its neighbors. 

For even `n`, the program constructs a string `s` by repeating the substring "AAB" `n // 2` times. This construction ensures that every character 'A' in the pattern "AAB" is a special character, as it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors ('B'). Since "AAB" contributes exactly 2 special characters, repeating it `n // 2` times results in exactly `n` special characters.

The program then checks if the length of the constructed string `s` is less than 200. Given that each repetition of "AAB" adds 3 characters, the length of `s` is `3 * (n // 2)`. Since `n` is at most 50, the maximum length of `s` would be `3 * (50 // 2) = 75`, which is well below the 200-character limit. Therefore, the program will always print "YES" followed by the constructed string when `n` is even.

Given these points, the program correctly handles all possible inputs within the specified constraints.

Correctness: **True**
