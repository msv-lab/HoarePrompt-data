In the provided for loop, the only variable that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `t`, as the loop iterates `_` times, where `_` ranges from 0 to `t-1`. The variable `n` is not directly involved in the loop's execution condition.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, `t` must be at least 1. Since `t` is already stated to be an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, no adjustment to `t` is necessary to ensure the loop will execute. However, to be explicit in the state, we can confirm that `t` is within the valid range and specify that the loop will execute because `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive (ensuring the loop will execute at least once), `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive**
