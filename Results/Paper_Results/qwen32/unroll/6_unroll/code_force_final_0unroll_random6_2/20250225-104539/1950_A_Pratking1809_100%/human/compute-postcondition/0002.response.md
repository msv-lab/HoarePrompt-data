Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; q is an input integer. After executing the loop, no changes are made to t, q, or the input values of a, b, and c, but the program will have printed 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' for each of the q iterations based on the conditions provided.**
