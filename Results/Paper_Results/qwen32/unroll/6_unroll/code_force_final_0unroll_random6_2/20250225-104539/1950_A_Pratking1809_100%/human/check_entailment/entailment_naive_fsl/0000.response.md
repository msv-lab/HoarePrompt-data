Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies whether the given three digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the conditions specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads three digits, `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a "STAIR".
4. It checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a "PEAK".
5. If neither condition is met, it outputs "NONE".

The logic covers all possible combinations of the three digits and handles the conditions specified correctly. The example inputs provided in the problem description are also handled correctly by the program. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the program to produce incorrect results based on the given problem description.
