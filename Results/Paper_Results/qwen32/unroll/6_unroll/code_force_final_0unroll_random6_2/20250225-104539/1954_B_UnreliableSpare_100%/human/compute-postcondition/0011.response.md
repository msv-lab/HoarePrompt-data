The `print(-1)` statement will output the value `-1` regardless of the values of the variables `flag`, `ans`, `val`, and `cnt` as described in the initial state. The `print` function in Python outputs exactly what is provided to it, and in this case, it is `-1`.

Let's break down the given information for clarity:
- `flag` is set to `True`.
- `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and `cnt`.
- `val` is set to the first element of the array `arr`.
- `cnt` is the count of consecutive `val` elements at the end of the array.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, they do not influence the output.

Output: **-1**
