### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary.

#### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element with its neighbor if the neighbor on either side is the same.

#### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `arr`.

2. **Initial Check for Uniform Array**:
   - It initializes a flag `flag` to `True` and iterates through the array to check if all elements are the same.
   - If it finds any two consecutive elements that are different, it sets `flag` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If `flag` remains `True`, it means the array is uniform (all elements are the same), and the program correctly outputs `-1` since a uniform array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

3. **Finding Minimum Removals**:
   - It initializes `ans` to positive infinity (`Decimal('Infinity')`).
   - It then iterates through the array to find the length of the longest contiguous segment of the same value.
   - For each segment, it updates `ans` to the minimum length of such segments.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time to account for the last segment.
   - Finally, it prints `ans` as the result.

#### Issues in the Program

- **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Removals**:
  - The logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove is incorrect. The program is trying to find the length of the longest contiguous segment of the same value and then using that to determine the minimum removals, which is not the correct approach.
  - The correct approach should involve identifying the smallest segment that, when removed, breaks the beautiful property of the array. This is not what the current logic does.
  - The function summary correctly identifies the issue: the program finds the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same, but this does not necessarily give the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

### Correctness

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The logic for finding the minimum removals is flawed.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: False**
