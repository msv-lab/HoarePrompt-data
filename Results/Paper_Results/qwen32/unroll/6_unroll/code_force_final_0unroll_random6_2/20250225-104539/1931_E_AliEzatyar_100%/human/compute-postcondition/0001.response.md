The only variables in the loop head of the given for loop are `i` and the result of `len(num) - 1`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `num`.

To ensure that the loop executes at least once, the list `num` must have at least one test case. The loop iterates from the last index to the first index of the `num` list. Therefore, `len(num) - 1` should be a valid index, which means `len(num)` should be at least 1.

The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is assigned the value of `len(num) - 1` at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `num` has at least one test case.

State: **`num` is a list of test cases with at least one test case, `counter` is 0**
