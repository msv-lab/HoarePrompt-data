Reasoning:  
The provided program and its execution summary have a few issues that need to be addressed to determine its correctness.

1. **Incorrect Functionality of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to count the number of trailing zeros in a string representation of a number. However, in the execution summary, it is incorrectly stated that `func_1` accepts a parameter `num` which is expected to be a list. In the actual code, `func_1` is correctly used with string inputs (elements of `array`).

2. **Logic of the Program**:
   - The program attempts to determine the winner by calculating the total number of digits and subtracting the number of trailing zeros from even-indexed elements in the sorted list of trailing zeros. However, this logic does not correctly simulate the game rules described in the problem.
   - The game involves strategic choices by both players: Anna reversing digits and Sasha concatenating numbers. The program does not simulate these choices or their outcomes.
   - The condition `if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:` is not a correct criterion for determining the winner based on the rules provided.

3. **Game Strategy**:
   - The game's outcome depends on the strategic decisions made by both players. Without simulating these decisions, it is impossible to determine the winner based solely on the total number of digits and trailing zeros.

Given the above points, the provided program does not correctly simulate the game and determine the winner based on the optimal play of both Sasha and Anna. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
