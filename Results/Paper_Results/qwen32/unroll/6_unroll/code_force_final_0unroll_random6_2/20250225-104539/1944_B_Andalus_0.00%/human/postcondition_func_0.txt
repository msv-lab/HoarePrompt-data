The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of `2n` integers where each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice. It then prints a sequence of integers based on specific conditions related to the values of `n`, `k`, and the list `a`. The output consists of up to `k` integers selected from the list, ensuring that if an integer appears twice in the list, both instances are printed together when possible.
