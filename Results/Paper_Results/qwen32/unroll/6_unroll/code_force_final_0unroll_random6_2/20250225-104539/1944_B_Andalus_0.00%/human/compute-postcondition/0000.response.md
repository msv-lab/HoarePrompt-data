Output State: **`T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 5000; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n / 2⌋. `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 5 ⋅ 10^4.**

Explanation: The variable `T` is assigned the value of the integer input, representing the number of test cases. Other variables like `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged in this state.
