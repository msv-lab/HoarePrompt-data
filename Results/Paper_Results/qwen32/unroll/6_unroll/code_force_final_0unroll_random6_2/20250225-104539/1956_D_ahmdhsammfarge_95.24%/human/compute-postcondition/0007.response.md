The value of `n` is calculated as `l - r + 1`. The initial conditions for `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops` remain unchanged. The new operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` is already included in the `ops` list as per the initial state.

Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that `0 <= r <= l < len(lst)`, `lst` is a list of integers, `ops` is a list that will store operations as lists of two integers and includes the operation `[r + 1, r + 1]` and the new operation `[r + 1, l + 1]`, `n` is `l - r + 1`.**
