Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of an array by performing a series of operations.
   - Each operation allows us to choose a subarray, compute its MEX, and set all elements of that subarray to this MEX.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.
   - The goal is to find the maximum possible sum of the array and the sequence of operations to achieve it.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**

   - **Function `func_1(lst)`:**
     - This function seems to be trying to find a pair of indices `(r, l)` that maximize the sum of the array if we were to replace the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` with a constant value.
     - It computes the sum of the array excluding the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` and adds the square of the length of the subarray `(j - i + 1) ** 2`.
     - However, this approach does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray, and the logic for finding the maximum sum is flawed. The MEX operation is critical for maximizing the sum, but this function does not compute it.

   - **Function `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`:**
     - This function appears to recursively append operations to the `ops` list.
     - The logic seems to be broken as it does not properly handle the MEX operation and the goal of maximizing the sum.

   - **Function `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`:**
     - This function seems to append several operations to the `ops` list and then replaces the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` with the length of the subarray `n`.
     - The replacement with `n` does not guarantee the maximum sum because it does not consider the MEX operation.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The code does not correctly implement the MEX operation.
   - The logic for finding the maximum sum and constructing the sequence of operations is flawed.
   - The provided code does not guarantee that the maximum possible sum is achieved, nor does it correctly compute the sequence of operations.

### Correctness:

Based on the analysis, the provided code is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
