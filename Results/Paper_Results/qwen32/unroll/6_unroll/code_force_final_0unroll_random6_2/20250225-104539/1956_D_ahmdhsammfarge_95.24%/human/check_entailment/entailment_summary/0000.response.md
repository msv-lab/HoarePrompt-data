### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify whether it meets the problem's requirements and constraints. Specifically, we need to check if the program can maximize the sum of the array and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.

Let's break down the program and its components:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the length of the array `n` and the array `lst` itself.
   - It initializes an empty list `ops` to store the operations performed.

2. **Finding the Optimal Subarray**:
   - `func_1(lst)` is used to find the subarray `[r, l]` that, when replaced by its MEX value, maximizes the sum of the array. However, the function does not directly compute the MEX value; instead, it computes a modified sum based on the square of the subarray's length and the sum of elements outside the subarray. This approach does not directly align with the goal of maximizing the sum by replacing subarrays with their MEX values.

3. **Performing Operations**:
   - `func_3(r, l, lst, ops)` is supposed to perform the operation on the subarray `[r, l]`, replacing it with its MEX value `n` (the length of the subarray). However, the function does not correctly compute the MEX value and instead sets all elements in the subarray to `n`.
   - `func_2(r, l, ops)` is a recursive function that appends operations to `ops` but does not seem to contribute to the correct logic for maximizing the sum.

4. **Handling Zeros**:
   - The program attempts to handle zeros in the array by replacing them with `1` and appending the corresponding operations to `ops`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The program does not correctly compute the MEX value for any subarray. Instead, it uses a heuristic based on the square of the subarray's length, which does not guarantee the maximum sum.
- **Incorrect Operation Logic**: The operations performed do not align with the problem's requirements. The program should replace subarrays with their MEX values, not with the length of the subarray.
- **Inefficient Handling of Zeros**: The program's approach to handling zeros is not optimal and does not ensure that the maximum sum is achieved.

### Conclusion:
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to maximize the sum of the array by performing the correct operations based on the MEX value.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
