The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. Let's analyze the code step-by-step to understand why.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function 1: `func_1`
- **Purpose**: To find the best subarray (defined by indices `l` and `r`) to perform an operation on to maximize the sum.
- **Logic**: The function iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates a potential new sum if the subarray is replaced with its MEX value squared. However, the function does not calculate the MEX value correctly. Instead, it calculates the sum as `(j - i + 1) ** 2`, which is incorrect. The MEX value should be computed based on the elements in the subarray, not just the length of the subarray.
- **Issue**: The function does not correctly compute the MEX value, which is crucial for determining the correct subarray to modify.

#### Function 2: `func_2`
- **Purpose**: To recursively add operations to the list `ops`.
- **Logic**: This function is recursive and seems to be intended to add a series of operations to achieve a certain transformation of the array. However, the logic is not clear and does not align with the problem requirements.
- **Issue**: The function's logic is unclear and does not seem to correctly implement the operations needed to maximize the sum of the array.

#### Function 3: `func_3`
- **Purpose**: To perform the operation on the subarray and update the list `ops` and the array `lst`.
- **Logic**: The function adds operations to the list `ops` and modifies the subarray in `lst` to have the same value as the MEX value of the subarray. However, it incorrectly assumes that the MEX value is the length of the subarray, which is incorrect.
- **Issue**: The function does not correctly compute the MEX value, leading to incorrect modifications of the array.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly compute the MEX value for any subarray, which is a critical part of the problem. As a result, the operations performed on the array do not necessarily maximize the sum of the array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
