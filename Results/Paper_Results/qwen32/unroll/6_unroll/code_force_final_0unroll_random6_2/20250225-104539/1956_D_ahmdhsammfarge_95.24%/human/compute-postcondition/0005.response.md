To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we need to understand the impact of the function call `func_2(r, l, ops)`. However, the function `func_2` is not defined in the provided context, so we can only make assumptions based on the typical behavior of such functions in similar scenarios.

Given the initial state:
- `r` and `l` are integers such that `0 <= r <= l < len(lst)`.
- `lst` is a list of integers.
- `ops` is a list that will store operations as lists of two integers.
- `ops` includes an additional operation `[r + 1, r + 1]`.

Without the definition of `func_2`, we can infer that the function might perform some operation on the list `lst` based on the indices `r` and `l`, and it might modify the list `ops`. Since the specific behavior of `func_2` is not provided, we can only describe the state based on the fact that `ops` will be modified by adding an operation `[r + 1, r + 1]`.

Thus, the output state would be:
- `r` and `l` remain unchanged.
- `lst` remains unchanged.
- `ops` will have an additional operation `[r + 1, r + 1]` added to it.

Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that `0 <= r <= l < len(lst)`, `lst` is a list of integers, `ops` is a list that will store operations as lists of two integers and includes an additional operation `[r + 1, r + 1]`.**
