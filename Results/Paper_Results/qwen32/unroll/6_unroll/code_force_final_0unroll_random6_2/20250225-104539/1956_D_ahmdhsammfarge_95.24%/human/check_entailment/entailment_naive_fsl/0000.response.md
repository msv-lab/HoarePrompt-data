Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array by performing the allowed operations. Let's analyze the issues:

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to find the optimal subarray `[r, l]` to replace with its MEX value to maximize the sum. However, the implementation does not correctly compute the MEX value for the subarray. Instead, it simply calculates a sum based on the length of the subarray and compares it to the current sum, which is not the correct approach.
   - The MEX value should be computed as the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, and the sum should be updated based on this MEX value, not the square of the length of the subarray.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is supposed to generate the operations to replace subarrays but is not correctly implemented. It does not generate the operations based on the MEX value but rather in a recursive manner that does not align with the problem requirements.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function attempts to perform the operations and update the list but does so incorrectly. It does not correctly compute the MEX value for the subarray and does not generate the operations in a way that maximizes the sum.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Identify the MEX value for each subarray.
2. Replace the subarray with this MEX value if it increases the sum.
3. Generate the operations to achieve this replacement.

### Example Case:
Let's consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The correct output should be:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
Explanation:
- Replace the subarray `[3, 3]` with `0` (MEX value of `[2]` is `0`), resulting in `[1, 100, 0, 1]`.
- Replace the subarray `[3, 4]` with `2` (MEX value of `[0, 1]` is `2`), resulting in `[1, 100, 2, 2]`.
- The sum is `1 + 100 + 2 + 2 = 105`.

The provided code does not correctly implement these steps, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the correctness of the program is `False`.
