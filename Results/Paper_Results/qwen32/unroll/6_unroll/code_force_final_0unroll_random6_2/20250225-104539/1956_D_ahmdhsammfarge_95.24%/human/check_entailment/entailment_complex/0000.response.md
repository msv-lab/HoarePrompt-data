### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given Python program and its functions in the context of the problem statement.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Objective**: Maximize the sum of the array by performing operations that replace a subarray with its MEX (Minimum Excluded Value).
- **Constraints**: The number of operations should be no more than \(5 \times 10^5\).
- **Input**: An array of integers.
- **Output**: The maximum sum and the sequence of operations.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Main Program**:
    - **Input Handling**: Reads the length of the array and the array itself.
    - **Initialization**: Initializes an empty list `ops` to store operations.
    - **Loop to Optimize**: Continuously calls `func_1` to find the subarray that maximizes the sum when replaced by its MEX until no further improvement is possible.
    - **Handling Zeros**: Ensures that any zeros in the array are replaced with ones to maximize the sum.
    - **Output**: Prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
    - **Purpose**: Find the subarray `[r, l]` that, when replaced by its MEX, maximizes the sum of the array.
    - **Implementation**: Iterates over all possible subarrays, calculates the potential new sum if the subarray were replaced by its MEX, and keeps track of the subarray that yields the maximum sum.
    - **Output**: Returns the indices `r` and `l` of the subarray that maximizes the sum.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
    - **Purpose**: Recursively appends operations to the `ops` list.
    - **Implementation**: Calls itself recursively with `l-1` and appends operations to `ops`.
    - **Output**: Modifies the `ops` list without returning anything.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
    - **Purpose**: Replace the subarray `[r, l]` with its MEX and append the corresponding operations to `ops`.
    - **Implementation**: Appends operations to `ops`, checks if the minimum value in the subarray is zero, and then replaces the subarray with its MEX.
    - **Output**: Returns the modified list `lst`.

#### Issues in the Code:
- **Incorrect Use of `func_2`**: The function `func_2` is called recursively and appends operations in a way that does not align with the problem's requirement to find the MEX and replace the subarray with it. The recursive calls and the way operations are appended are not necessary and may lead to incorrect operations.
- **Logic for Finding MEX**: The function `func_1` does not actually compute the MEX of a subarray; instead, it calculates a potential new sum based on the square of the subarray's length, which is not aligned with the problem's goal.
- **Handling Zeros**: The loop that replaces zeros with ones is not part of the main optimization loop and may not be necessary if the main loop correctly maximizes the sum.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the MEX of a subarray and replace it to maximize the sum of the array. The recursive function `func_2` does not contribute to the correct solution, and the logic in `func_1` is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

Thus, the program is **incorrect**.

**Correctness: False**
