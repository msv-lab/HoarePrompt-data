In the given task, the for loop iterates over each element in the list `ans_f`. The loop body is omitted, but we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the state of the objects in the loop head. The only object in the loop head is `i`, which represents each element in `ans_f`.

For the loop to execute, `ans_f` must contain at least one element. The state of `i` will be automatically set to the first element of `ans_f` when the loop starts, so we do not need to explicitly set `i`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `ans_f` has at least one element.

State: **`ans_f` is a list containing the sums of the minimum values of each pair of integers for each test case, and `ans_f` must have at least one element**.
