Let's analyze the provided code step by step to determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

The given code processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it does the following:
1. Reads an integer `n`, which represents the number of pairs of integers.
2. Reads a string `l`, which contains `n * 2` space-separated integers.
3. Splits the string `l` into a list `lst` of integers.
4. Iterates over the list `lst` and calculates the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers.
5. Appends the calculated sum to the list `ans_f`.

The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it processes a test case as described. The final output state will be the list `ans_f` containing the results of each test case.

Since the problem asks for the output state after all iterations, we need to focus on the final state of `ans_f`. The variable `t` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the loop, and the list `ans_f` accumulates the results of each test case.

Output State: **ans_f is a list containing the sums of the minimum values of each pair of integers for each test case.**
