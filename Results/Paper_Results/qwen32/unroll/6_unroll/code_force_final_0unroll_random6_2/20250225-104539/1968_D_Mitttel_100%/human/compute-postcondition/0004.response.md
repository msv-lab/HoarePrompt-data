To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition:

```
while not vis[s] and k > 0:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if both conditions `not vis[s]` and `k > 0` are true. Let's break down each condition:

1. **`not vis[s]`**: This condition checks if the element at index `s` in the list `vis` is `False` (or `0` in this context, since `vis` is a list of `n` zeros).
2. **`k > 0`**: This condition checks if the integer `k` is greater than `0`.

### Analysis:
- **`vis` is a list of `n` zeros**: This means initially, all elements in `vis` are `0` (False). Therefore, `not vis[s]` will be `True` for any valid index `s` (since `vis[s]` will be `0`).
- **`k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9)**: Since `k` is guaranteed to be in the range from `1` to `10^9`, the condition `k > 0` will always be `True`.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state provided:
- `vis` is a list of `n` zeros, so `not vis[s]` will be `True` for any valid index `s`.
- `k` is an integer in the range `1` to `10^9`, so `k > 0` will be `True`.

Since both conditions are inherently satisfied with the given state, no adjustments are necessary to ensure the loop can execute the first time.

### Final State:
State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n), `s` is a tuple of two integers (P_B, P_S) where 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n, and `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9). The length of the lists `a` and `p` is `n`, and `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5). `mx` is 0. `cur` is 0. `vis` is a list of `n` zeros.**
