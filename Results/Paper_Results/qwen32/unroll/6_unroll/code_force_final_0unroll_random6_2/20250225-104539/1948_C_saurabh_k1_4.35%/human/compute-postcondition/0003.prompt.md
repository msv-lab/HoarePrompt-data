You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5. The first row and the second row of the grid are strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: After executing the loop, the variable `t` remains unchanged as it represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the program prints either 'Yes' or 'No' based on the condition `if b[n - 2] == '<'`. The output is a series of 'Yes' or 'No' responses, one for each test case, with no changes to the initial state of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b` outside of the loop iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters. The function returns a result for each test case based on the configuration of the '<' and '>' characters in the two strings.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
