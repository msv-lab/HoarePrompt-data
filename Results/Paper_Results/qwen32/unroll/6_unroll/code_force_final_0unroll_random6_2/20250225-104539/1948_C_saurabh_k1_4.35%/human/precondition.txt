test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n is even), and two strings of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>' characters representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
