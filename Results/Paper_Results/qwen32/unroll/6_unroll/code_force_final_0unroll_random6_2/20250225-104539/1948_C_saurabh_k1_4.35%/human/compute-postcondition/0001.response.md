Output State: **After executing the loop, the variable `t` remains unchanged as it represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the program prints either 'Yes' or 'No' based on the condition `if b[n - 2] == '<'`. The output is a series of 'Yes' or 'No' responses, one for each test case, with no changes to the initial state of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b` outside of the loop iterations.**
