Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n). The logic in the program is overly simplistic and does not account for the robot's movement based on the arrows in the grid.

The program only checks if the second-to-last cell in the second row contains a left-pointing arrow (`<`). If it does, the program outputs "No"; otherwise, it outputs "Yes". This is incorrect because the robot's path is influenced by the sequence of arrows in both rows, not just the second-to-last cell in the second row.

To correctly solve the problem, the program would need to simulate the robot's movements according to the arrows in the grid and check if it can reach the target cell (2, n). This involves handling the robot's moves in both rows and considering the direction of the arrows in each cell.
