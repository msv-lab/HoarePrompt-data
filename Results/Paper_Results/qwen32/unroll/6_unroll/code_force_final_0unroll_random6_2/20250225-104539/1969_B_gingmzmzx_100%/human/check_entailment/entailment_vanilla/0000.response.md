To determine if the provided Python program is correct, let's analyze the problem and the given solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to sort a binary string in non-descending order using the minimum cost. The cost of sorting is defined by the length of the substring that is cyclically shifted. The goal is to find the minimum total cost required to sort the string.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution iterates through each test case and performs the following steps:

1. It reads the number of test cases `n`.
2. For each test case, it reads the binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers.
3. It counts the number of zeroes in the string.
4. It initializes two counters, `cnt`, to keep track of the number of zeroes and ones encountered so far.
5. It iterates through the string and updates the counters. For each character:
   - If the character is `0`, it adds `1` to the answer if there have been any `1`s encountered before (i.e., `cnt[1] > 0`).
   - If the character is `1`, it adds the number of remaining zeroes (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to the answer.
6. It prints the total cost for each test case.

### Correctness Check:
The logic of the solution seems to be incorrect. The provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum cost required to sort the string. It does not consider the actual cyclic shifting operations and their costs. Instead, it seems to be counting the number of transitions from `1` to `0` and vice versa, which does not directly translate to the minimum cost of sorting the string.

#### Example:
Let's consider the third test case from the problem statement: `11000`.

- The provided solution would calculate the cost as follows:
  - `cnt[0] = 0`, `cnt[1] = 0`, `ans = 0`
  - `c = 1`: `cnt[1] = 1`, `ans = 0`
  - `c = 1`: `cnt[1] = 2`, `ans = 0`
  - `c = 0`: `cnt[0] = 1`, `ans = 2` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
  - `c = 0`: `cnt[0] = 2`, `ans = 2`
  - `c = 0`: `cnt[0] = 3`, `ans = 2`
- The result would be `2`, which is incorrect.

The correct cost for sorting `11000` should be `9` as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
