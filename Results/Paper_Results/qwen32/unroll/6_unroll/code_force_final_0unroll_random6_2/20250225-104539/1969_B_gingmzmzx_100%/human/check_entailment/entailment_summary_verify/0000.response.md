Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to determine the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring `s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r` is `r - l + 1`.

### Provided Program Analysis:
Here is the provided program code again for reference:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)
```

### Function Summary Recap:
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`. It calculates and prints the number of inversions in each binary string, where an inversion is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and s[i] > s[j].

### Evaluation of the Program:
The function summary indicates that the program calculates the number of inversions in the binary string. However, the problem requires calculating the minimum cost to sort the string using cyclic shifts.

Let's examine the logic within the program:
1. **Counting `0`s and `1`s**:
   - `zeroes` counts the total number of `0`s in the string.
   - `cnt` keeps track of the number of `0`s and `1`s encountered so far.

2. **Calculating `ans`**:
   - For each character `c` in the string:
     - If `c` is `0` and there has been at least one `1` encountered (`cnt[1] > 0`), it adds `1` to `ans`.
     - If `c` is `1`, it adds the number of remaining `0`s (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans`.

### Reasoning:
The logic in the program is indeed counting the number of inversions in the string. This is because:
- An inversion occurs when a `1` is followed by a `0`.
- The program correctly identifies such pairs and counts them.

However, the problem requires the minimum cost to sort the string using cyclic shifts, not just counting inversions. The number of inversions is a measure of how far the string is from being sorted, but it does not directly translate to the minimum cost of cyclic shifts.

### Conclusion:
The program is calculating the number of inversions, which is not the same as the minimum cost to sort the string using cyclic shifts. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
