You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a binary string `s`. It calculates and prints the number of inversions in each binary string, where an inversion is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and s[i] > s[j].

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the provided Python program is correct, let's analyze the problem and the given solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to sort a binary string in non-descending order using the minimum cost. The cost of sorting is defined by the length of the substring that is cyclically shifted. The goal is to find the minimum total cost required to sort the string.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution iterates through each test case and performs the following steps:

1. It reads the number of test cases `n`.
2. For each test case, it reads the binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers.
3. It counts the number of zeroes in the string.
4. It initializes two counters, `cnt`, to keep track of the number of zeroes and ones encountered so far.
5. It iterates through the string and updates the counters. For each character:
   - If the character is `0`, it adds `1` to the answer if there have been any `1`s encountered before (i.e., `cnt[1] > 0`).
   - If the character is `1`, it adds the number of remaining zeroes (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to the answer.
6. It prints the total cost for each test case.

### Correctness Check:
The logic of the solution seems to be incorrect. The provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum cost required to sort the string. It does not consider the actual cyclic shifting operations and their costs. Instead, it seems to be counting the number of transitions from `1` to `0` and vice versa, which does not directly translate to the minimum cost of sorting the string.

#### Example:
Let's consider the third test case from the problem statement: `11000`.

- The provided solution would calculate the cost as follows:
  - `cnt[0] = 0`, `cnt[1] = 0`, `ans = 0`
  - `c = 1`: `cnt[1] = 1`, `ans = 0`
  - `c = 1`: `cnt[1] = 2`, `ans = 0`
  - `c = 0`: `cnt[0] = 1`, `ans = 2` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
  - `c = 0`: `cnt[0] = 2`, `ans = 2`
  - `c = 0`: `cnt[0] = 3`, `ans = 2`
- The result would be `2`, which is incorrect.

The correct cost for sorting `11000` should be `9` as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
