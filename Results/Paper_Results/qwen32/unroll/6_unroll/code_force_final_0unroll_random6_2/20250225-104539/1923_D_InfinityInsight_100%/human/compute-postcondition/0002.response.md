The code initializes a list `ans` with `-1` repeated `n` times. This affects the variable `ans`, but does not change the values of `a`, `n`, `left`, or `last`. 

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of the slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n == len(a)` and `n >= 1`, `left` is a list containing a single element, `0`, `last` is a list containing a single element, `-1`, `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times.**
