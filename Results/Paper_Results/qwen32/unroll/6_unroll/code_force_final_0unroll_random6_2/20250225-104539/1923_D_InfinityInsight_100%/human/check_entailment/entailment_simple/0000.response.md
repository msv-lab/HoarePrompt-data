To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- `func_1` is supposed to find the position in the list `a` where the value `x` could be inserted while maintaining the sorted order, or return the position of `x` if it exists in the list.
- It uses `bisect_left` to find the insertion point and then checks if the value at that position is equal to `x`. If it is, it returns the position plus one; otherwise, it returns the insertion point.
- This function seems to be working correctly based on its intended purpose.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- `func_2` is the main function that calculates the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.
- It initializes `left` as a list of cumulative sums of the slime sizes and `last` as a list that tracks the last index where a different slime size was encountered.
- The function iterates through the slime sizes and updates `ans` based on whether a slime can eat its previous neighbor.
- If a slime can eat its previous neighbor (i.e., `a[i] < a[i - 1]`), it sets `ans[i]` to 1.
- Otherwise, it calculates the cumulative sum up to the current slime minus the current slime size minus one to find the position in `left` where the current slime could eat another slime.
- It then uses `func_1` to find the insertion point and updates `ans[i]` based on the difference between the current index and the insertion point.
- The function also considers the `last` list to ensure that it only considers valid previous slimes.

### Main Program:
- The main program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
- For each test case, it calls `func_2` twice: once with the original list of slime sizes and once with the reversed list.
- It then combines the results from both calls to determine the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.
- If a slime cannot be eaten in either direction, it sets the result to -1.

### Correctness Check:
- The program correctly handles the logic of finding the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten by considering both directions.
- It uses the `bisect_left` function effectively to find insertion points and updates the results accordingly.
- The program also handles the case where a slime cannot be eaten correctly by setting the result to -1.

Based on the analysis, the program appears to be correctly implementing the logic described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
