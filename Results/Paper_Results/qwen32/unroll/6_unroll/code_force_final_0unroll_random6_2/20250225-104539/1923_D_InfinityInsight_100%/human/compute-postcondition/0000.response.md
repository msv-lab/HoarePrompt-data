Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of the slimes, and `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n == len(a)` and `n >= 1`. `left` is a list containing a single element, `0`.**

In simpler terms, the list `left` has been initialized with a single element, `0`, while the list `a` and the integer `n` remain unchanged.
