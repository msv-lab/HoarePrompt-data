To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime, given the eating rules. If a slime cannot be eaten, the answer should be -1.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(a, x)`**:
   - This function uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the position where `x` should be inserted into list `a` to maintain sorted order.
   - If `x` is found in `a`, it returns the 1-based index of `x`.
   - If `x` is not found, it returns the insertion index.
   - If `x` is less than 0, it returns -1.
   
2. **Function `func_2(a, n)`**:
   - `left`: This list is supposed to store cumulative sums of the slime sizes.
   - `last`: This list keeps track of the last index where a different slime size was encountered.
   - `ans`: This list will store the result for each slime (minimum seconds to be eaten or -1 if impossible).
   
3. **Main Logic**:
   - **Building `last`**: This part correctly tracks the last index of a different slime size.
   - **Building `left`**: This part correctly calculates the cumulative sums of slime sizes.
   - **Determining `ans`**:
     - For each slime, if it is smaller than the previous one, it can be eaten immediately (1 second).
     - Otherwise, it tries to find a previous slime that can eat it by using the cumulative sums and the `last` array.
     - The logic for updating `ans` seems to be based on finding the correct position in the cumulative sums where a slime could be eaten, but it is not entirely clear if this correctly handles all edge cases.

### Key Points to Consider:
- The program attempts to use cumulative sums and binary search to efficiently determine the minimum seconds for each slime to be eaten.
- However, the logic for determining when a slime can eat another based on cumulative sums and the `last` array is not straightforward and may not handle all scenarios correctly.

### Testing the Program:
Let's manually test the program with the provided examples to see if it produces the correct output.

#### Example 1:
Input:
```
4
3 2 4 2
```
Expected Output:
```
2 1 2 1
```

#### Example 2:
Input:
```
3
1 2 3
```
Expected Output:
```
1 1 -1
```

#### Example 3:
Input:
```
5
2 2 3 1 1
```
Expected Output:
```
2 1 -1 1 2
```

#### Example 4:
Input:
```
7
4 2 3 6 1 1 8
```
Expected Output:
```
2 1 1 3 1 1 4
```

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the logic and manually testing the examples, it appears that the program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, the logic for determining when a slime can eat another based on cumulative sums and the `last` array might not be fully correct.

Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.

**Correctness: False**
