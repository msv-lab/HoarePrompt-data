The code snippet `ans.discard(0)` removes the value `0` from the set `ans` if it exists. Given that the initial state specifies that `ans` contains the value `0`, after executing this line, `0` will no longer be in the set `ans`.

Output State: **`ans` is a set of values generated by applying the transformations `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` to the initial value `x` for `m` iterations, based on `r` and `c` from `func_1()`, excluding the value `0`. `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.**
