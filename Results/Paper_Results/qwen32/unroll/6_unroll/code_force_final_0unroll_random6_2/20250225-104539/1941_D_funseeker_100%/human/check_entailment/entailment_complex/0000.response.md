### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem description to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - `func_2()` reads the number of test cases.
   - `func_4()` is called for each test case.
   - `func_3()` reads the first line of each test case (which contains `n`, `m`, and `x`).
   - `func_1()` reads each subsequent line (which contains `r` and `c`).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The initial set `ans` is initialized with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, the direction `c` is checked:
     - If `c` is '0' or '?', the ball can be thrown clockwise, and the new position `(q + r) % n` is added to `temp`.
     - If `c` is '1' or '?', the ball can be thrown counterclockwise, and the new position `(q - r) % n` is added to `temp`.
   - The set `ans` is updated to `temp` after processing each throw.
   - After processing all throws, if `0` is in `ans`, it is replaced with `n` because the modulo operation can result in `0` when the position wraps around to the last player.

3. **Output:**
   - The number of unique players who could have the ball is printed.
   - The sorted list of these unique player numbers is printed.

### Verification:

- **Modulo Operation:**
  - The modulo operation `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` correctly calculates the new positions in a circular manner.
  - The special case where `(q - r) % n` results in `0` is handled by replacing `0` with `n`.

- **Handling Unknown Directions:**
  - The '?' character correctly allows both clockwise and counterclockwise throws, ensuring all possible positions are considered.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code handles cases where `r` is equal to `n-1`, ensuring that the ball wraps around correctly.
  - The code handles cases where `m` is `0`, meaning no throws are made, and the initial player `x` is the only possible player with the ball.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It reads the input, processes each test case according to the rules, and outputs the correct results.

### Your response:
Correctness: **True**
