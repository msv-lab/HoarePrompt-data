The code adds the value `n` to the set `ans`. Since `ans` initially contains values generated by the transformations `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` applied to the initial value `x` for `m` iterations, excluding the value `0`, and `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged, the new output state will include `n` as an additional element in the set `ans`.

Output State: **`ans` is a set of values generated by applying the transformations `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` to the initial value `x` for `m` iterations, based on `r` and `c` from `func_1()`, excluding the value `0`, and including the value `n`. `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.**
