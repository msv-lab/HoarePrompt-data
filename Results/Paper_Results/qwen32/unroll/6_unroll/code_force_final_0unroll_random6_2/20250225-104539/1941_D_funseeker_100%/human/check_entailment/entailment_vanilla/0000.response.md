### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify if it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `x` representing the number of players, the number of throws, and the starting player, respectively.
   - It then reads `m` lines of input, each containing an integer `r` and a character `c` representing the distance and direction of the throw.

2. **Logic:**
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it updates the set `ans` based on the possible directions of the throw (`'0'` for clockwise, `'1'` for counterclockwise, and `'?'` for both directions).
   - For each player in the current set `ans`, it calculates the new player positions after the throw and adds these new positions to a temporary set `temp`.
   - After processing all throws, it updates `ans` to be the temporary set `temp`.
   - It handles the case where the modulo operation results in `0` by replacing `0` with `n` (since player numbers are 1-based).

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of possible players who could have the ball after all throws.
   - It prints the sorted list of these player numbers.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the direction of the throw is unknown (`'?'`) by considering both clockwise and counterclockwise possibilities.
   - It correctly uses modulo arithmetic to wrap around the circle of players.

### Verification:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

#### Example Input:
```
5
6 3 2
2 ?
2 ?
2 ?
12 1 2
3 1
10 7 4
2 ?
9 1
4 ?
7 0
2 0
8 1
5 ?
5 3 1
4 0
4 ?
1 ?
4 1 1
2 ?
```

#### Expected Output:
```
3
2 4 6 
1
11 
4
3 5 7 9 
3
2 3 5 
1
3 
```

#### Program Output:
The program should produce the expected output based on the logic described above. It correctly calculates the possible positions of the ball after each throw and handles the unknown directions by considering both possibilities.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It handles all the given constraints and edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
