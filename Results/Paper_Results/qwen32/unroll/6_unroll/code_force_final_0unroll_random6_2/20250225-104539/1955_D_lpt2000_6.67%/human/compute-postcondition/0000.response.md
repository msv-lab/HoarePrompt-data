The provided code snippet only reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `nabors`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`) are not affected by this line of code. The value of `nabors` will be the integer input provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5; a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; b is a list of m integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^6; The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `nabors` is an input integer.**
