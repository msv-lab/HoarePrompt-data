The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the range of the loop is determined by `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than 0. This means `len(costs)` must be at least `k`.

Given that `costs` is a list where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`, and `rows` is a 2D list with `n` sublists, `len(costs)` will be `n`. Therefore, `n` must be at least `k` for the loop to execute.

The state of `i` before the loop starts does not need to be adjusted, as it will be initialized by the `for` loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and must be at least `k`, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `rows` is a 2D list of integers with `n` sublists, each containing `m` integers, `costs` is a list of integers where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows` and must have at least `k` elements, `total_costs` is an empty list**
