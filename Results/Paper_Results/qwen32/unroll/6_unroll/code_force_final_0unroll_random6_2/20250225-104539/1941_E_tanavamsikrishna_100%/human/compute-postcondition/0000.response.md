The provided code snippet reads four integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`. The initial state specifies that `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are already positive integers, and `rows` is a 2D list of integers with specific properties. However, the code snippet does not affect `rows`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid and contains `m` integers, with the first and last integers in each sublist being 0.**

In simple terms, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are updated to the integers provided by the input, while `rows` remains unchanged.
