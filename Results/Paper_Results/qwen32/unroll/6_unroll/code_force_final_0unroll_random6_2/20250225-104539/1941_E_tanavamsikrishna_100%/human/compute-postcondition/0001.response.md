The provided Python code snippet reads `n` lines of input, where each line contains `m` integers separated by spaces. These integers are used to populate the 2D list `rows`. Given that `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers and `rows` is initially a 2D list of integers with specific constraints, the code will overwrite `rows` with the new input data.

Since the code snippet reads `n` lines of input and each line is split into `m` integers, the new `rows` will be a 2D list where each sublist contains `m` integers. The initial constraints on the values of the integers in `rows` (i.e., the first and last integers in each sublist being 0) are not guaranteed to be maintained by this code snippet, as it simply reads arbitrary integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `rows` is a 2D list of integers with `n` sublists, each containing `m` integers.**
