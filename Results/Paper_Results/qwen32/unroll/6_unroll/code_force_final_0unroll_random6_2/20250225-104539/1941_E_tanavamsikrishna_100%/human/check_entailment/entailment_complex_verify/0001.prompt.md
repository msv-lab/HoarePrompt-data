You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is
that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his
friend solve this problem.

The river is a grid of n rows and m columns. The intersection of the i -th row
and the j -th column contains the number a_{i,j} — the depth in the
corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the
river banks, so the depth for them is 0 .

The river may look like this.

Rudolf can choose the row (i,1), (i,2), \ldots, (i,m) and build a bridge over
it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost
of installing a support in the cell (i,j) is a_{i,j}+1 . Supports must be
installed so that the following conditions are met:

  1. A support must be installed in cell (i,1) ; 
  2. A support must be installed in cell (i,m) ; 
  3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d . The distance between supports (i, j_1) and (i, j_2) is |j_1 - j_2| - 1 . 

Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k
bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i (1 \le i
\le n - k + 1 ) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i, i + 1,
\ldots, i + k - 1 . Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing
supports.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , m , k , and d (1
\le k \le n \le 100 , 3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le d \le m ) — the number
of rows and columns of the field, the number of bridges, and the maximum
distance between supports.

Then follow n lines, i -th line contains m positive integers a_{i, j} (0 \le
a_{i, j} \le 10^6 , a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 ) — the depths of the river cells.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot m for all sets of input data does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum total cost of
supports installation.

Note

In the first test case, it is most profitable to build a bridge on the second
row.

It is not a top view, but side view: gray cells — bridge itself, white cells
are empty, black cells — supports, blue cells — water, brown cells — river
bottom.

In the second test case, it is most profitable to build bridges on the second
and third rows. The supports will be placed in cells (2, 3) , (3, 2) , and on
the river banks.

In the third test case the supports can be placed along the river banks.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function modifies a list of integers `row` by setting the first element to 1 and incrementing each of the next `d-1` elements by 2. It then updates each subsequent element in `row` based on a specific logic involving a min-heap, ensuring that each element is influenced by the minimum value within a sliding window of size `d`. Finally, the function returns the last element of the modified list `row`.

#Function 2:

    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: min(total_costs) (where total_costs is a list of sums of every possible k-sized contiguous sublist within the costs list)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` calculates and prints the minimum total cost required to build bridges over a series of `k` consecutive rows in a grid. The grid is defined by `n` rows and `m` columns, with each row represented as a list of integers. The integers in each row represent the cost of building bridges at each position, except for the first and last integers which are always 0. The parameter `d` specifies the maximum distance between supports. The function evaluates all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows and computes the total cost for each set, then outputs the minimum of these total costs.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the problem and the solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive bridges over a river grid. The grid has `n` rows and `m` columns where the first and last columns are river banks with depth 0. The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`. Supports must be installed in the first and last columns and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.

### Solution Analysis
The solution consists of two functions:
1. **func_1(row, d):** This function calculates the minimum cost to install supports for a single row under the given constraints.
2. **func_2():** This function reads the input, applies `func_1` to each row to get the cost of installing supports for a single bridge on each row, then finds the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive bridges.

#### Function `func_1(row, d)`
1. **Initialization:**
   - The first element of the row is set to 1 (`row[0] = 1`).
   - The next `d-1` elements are incremented by 2 (`row[i] = row[i] + 2` for `i` in `1` to `d-1`).
   
2. **Heap-based Calculation:**
   - A min-heap is created from the first `d` elements of the row.
   - For each subsequent element in the row, the heap is used to find the minimum cost of placing a support such that the distance constraint is respected.
   - The heap is updated with the new cost and the current element.

3. **Output:**
   - The function returns the cost of installing supports for the entire row.

#### Function `func_2()`
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are read.
   - The grid of river depths is read.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - `func_1` is applied to each row to calculate the cost of installing supports for a single bridge on that row.
   - The costs for `k` consecutive rows are summed up, and the minimum sum is found.

3. **Output:**
   - The minimum total cost for `k` consecutive bridges is printed.

### Correctness Evaluation
1. **Initialization in `func_1`:**
   - The first and last columns are always 0, and the cost of installing supports there is 1 (`0 + 1`).
   - The next `d-1` elements are incremented by 2, which seems correct for initializing the heap with the first `d` elements.

2. **Heap-based Calculation:**
   - The heap is used to efficiently find the minimum cost while respecting the distance constraint.
   - The heap is updated correctly with the new cost and the current element.

3. **Cost Calculation in `func_2`:**
   - The costs for each row are calculated correctly using `func_1`.
   - The minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows is found by summing up the costs and taking the minimum.

### Conclusion
The program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. It initializes the row costs correctly, uses a heap to efficiently find the minimum cost while respecting constraints, and correctly calculates the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive bridges.

Correctness: **True**
