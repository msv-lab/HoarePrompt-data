### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the given function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate or not.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
The `func_1` function is supposed to calculate the minimum cost of building a bridge over a single row, ensuring that supports are placed at the first and last columns and that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

- **Initialization**: The function sets `row[0] = 1` and initializes the first `d` elements with an increment of 2. This seems incorrect because the cost of placing a support in the first column should be `a_{i,1} + 1`, which is `1` since `a_{i,1} = 0`. The initial values for the next `d-1` elements should be calculated based on the correct cost formula, i.e., `row[i] + 1`.

- **Heap Usage**: The function uses a min-heap to maintain the minimum cost of placing supports within the last `d+1` positions. However, the logic for updating the heap and calculating the cost for each position after the first `d` elements seems flawed. The function does not ensure that the last element (representing the last column) is included in the calculation and correctly handles the constraints.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
The `func_2` function reads the input, calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`, and then finds the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.

- **Cost Calculation**: The function assumes that the costs calculated by `func_1` can be summed directly for `k` consecutive rows. However, since `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for each row, the total costs calculated for `k` consecutive rows are also incorrect.

#### Example Case Analysis:
The original assessment provides an example case where the program fails. Let's consider the following input:
```
1
3 5 2 1
0 1 2 1 0
0 2 1 2 0
0 1 1 1 0
```
The expected output is `6` because the minimum cost can be achieved by building bridges on the first and second rows with supports at positions (1,1), (1,2), (1,5), (2,1), (2,4), and (2,5).

However, the program will likely not produce the correct result because `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for each row while respecting the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem due to the incorrect implementation of `func_1` and the assumption that the costs calculated by `func_1` can be summed directly for `k` consecutive rows.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
