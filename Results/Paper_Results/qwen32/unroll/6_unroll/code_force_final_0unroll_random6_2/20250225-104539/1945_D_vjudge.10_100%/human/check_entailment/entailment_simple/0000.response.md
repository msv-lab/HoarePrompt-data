### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the list `a` and `b` in reverse order, trying to find the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position among the first `m` people in the queue. However, there are several issues with the logic:

1. **Initialization of `pergunta`**: The variable `pergunta` is initialized to `float('inf')`, which is correct for finding the minimum value. However, the variable `pergunta` is passed as an argument to `func_1`, and its value is not updated in the main loop. Instead, it should be initialized inside the function or passed by reference.

2. **Logic for calculating the minimum cost**: The logic inside `func_1` is incorrect. The goal is to find the minimum cost for Kirill to be among the first `m` people in the queue. The current implementation does not correctly handle the cost of bribing people to achieve this goal. Specifically, the cost should be calculated by considering the cost of bribing each person ahead of Kirill and the additional cost of bribing people in between.

3. **Incorrect use of `pergunta`**: The variable `pergunta` is used to store the minimum cost, but it is not updated correctly. The current implementation only updates `pergunta` when `i < m`, but it should consider the cumulative cost of bribes up to that point.

4. **Cumulative cost calculation**: The cumulative cost `x` is calculated as the sum of the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from `n-1` to `0`. This does not correctly represent the cost of bribing people to reach a specific position.

### Correctness:

Given the issues mentioned above, the program is incorrect. The logic for calculating the minimum cost is flawed, and the use of `pergunta` is not correctly implemented to achieve the desired result.

**Correctness: False**
