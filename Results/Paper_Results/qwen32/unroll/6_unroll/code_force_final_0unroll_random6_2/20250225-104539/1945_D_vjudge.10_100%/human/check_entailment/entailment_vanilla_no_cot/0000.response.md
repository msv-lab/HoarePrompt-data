Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` does not properly calculate the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue.

Here's a breakdown of the issues in the provided code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost**: The code does not correctly account for the cost of bribing people to move Kirill to a position within the first `m` positions.
2. **Logic Flaw**: The logic in the for loop does not consider the correct sequence of bribes to minimize the cost.
3. **Global Variable Misuse**: The `pergunta` variable is passed to the function but is not updated correctly in the main loop.

The correct approach involves using a greedy strategy or a priority queue to keep track of the minimum cost to move Kirill to the desired position. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import heapq

numCasos = int(input())
for _ in range(numCasos):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Priority queue to keep track of the minimum cost to bribe
    pq = []
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        if i < m - 1:
            heapq.heappush(pq, b[i])
            total_cost += b[i]
        elif i == m - 1:
            heapq.heappush(pq, b[i])
            total_cost += b[i]
            total_cost -= heapq.heappop(pq)
        else:
            if b[i] < pq[0]:
                total_cost += b[i] - heapq.heappop(pq)
                heapq.heappush(pq, b[i])
    
    # Add the minimum cost to bribe the last person to move Kirill to position m
    total_cost += min(a[:m])
    
    print(total_cost)
```

This corrected program uses a priority queue to efficiently keep track of the minimum costs of bribes and ensures that Kirill can move to one of the first `m` positions with the minimum total cost.
