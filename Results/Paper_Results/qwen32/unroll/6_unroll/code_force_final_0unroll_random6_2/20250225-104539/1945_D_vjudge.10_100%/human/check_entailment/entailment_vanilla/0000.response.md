Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
Kirill wants to move to a position among the first `m` people in the queue with the minimum cost. He can swap places with any person in front of him, paying `a[j]` coins if he swaps with the person at position `j`, and `b[k]` coins for each person `k` between `j` and his current position `i`.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution uses a function `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions. Let's walk through the logic:

1. **Initialization**: `pergunta` is initialized to infinity (`float('inf')`). This variable will store the minimum cost found.
2. **Loop Through People in Reverse Order**: The loop iterates from the last person in the queue (`n-1`) to the first person (`0`).
3. **Check if Current Position is Within First m Positions**: If the current position `i` is less than `m`, it means Kirill could potentially be in this position after some swaps. The cost to move to this position is calculated as the current accumulated cost `x` plus the cost `a[i]` to swap with the person at position `i`. The minimum cost is updated using `min(pergunta, x + a[i])`.
4. **Update Accumulated Cost**: The accumulated cost `x` is updated by adding the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to it. This step assumes that if Kirill moves past position `i`, he will pay the minimum of `a[i]` (cost to swap with person `i`) and `b[i]` (cost to pass person `i` without swapping).
5. **Output the Minimum Cost**: After the loop, the minimum cost stored in `pergunta` is printed.

### Issues in the Solution:
The logic in the provided solution has a critical flaw. Specifically, the assumption that the accumulated cost `x` should be updated by adding the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` is incorrect. When Kirill swaps with a person, he pays `a[i]`, but when he simply moves past a person without swapping, he pays `b[i]`. The correct approach should consider the actual cost incurred when moving past people without swapping and when swapping.

### Correct Approach:
A more accurate approach would involve a dynamic programming or greedy strategy that correctly accounts for the costs of swapping and passing people. The provided solution's logic does not correctly handle the costs incurred when Kirill moves past people without swapping.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the provided solution is incorrect due to the flawed logic in updating the accumulated cost `x`.

Correctness: **False**
