To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the game mechanics and the provided solution.

The game revolves around two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing a coin from their current wallet, with the option to swap wallets before doing so. The player who cannot make a move loses. The key to solving this problem is to recognize the game's symmetry and the optimal play strategy.

### Analysis of the Game:
- The game is symmetric in terms of the number of coins in the wallets. If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, the second player (Bob) can always mirror the first player's (Alice's) moves, ensuring he wins.
- Conversely, if the total number of coins is odd, the first player (Alice) can always make a move that forces the second player (Bob) into a losing position.

### Explanation of the Program:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. It then checks if the total number of coins (a + b) is even or odd:
- If the total number of coins is even (`a + b & 1 == 0`), the program outputs "Bob".
- If the total number of coins is odd, the program outputs "Alice".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described above. If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins because he can mirror Alice's moves. If the total number of coins is odd, Alice wins because she can force Bob into a losing position. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
