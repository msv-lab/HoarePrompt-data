The code snippet initializes the variable `position` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`. Therefore, the output state remains the same for `t`, `n`, and `k` except for the new value of `position`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. Additionally, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `n` is not equal to 0; `position` is 0.**
