You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf and Bernard decided to play a game with their friends. n people stand
in a circle and start throwing a ball to each other. They are numbered from 1
to n in the clockwise order.

Let's call a transition a movement of the ball from one player to his
neighbor. The transition can be made clockwise or counterclockwise.

Let's call the clockwise (counterclockwise) distance from player y_1 to player
y_2 the number of transitions clockwise (counterclockwise) that need to be
made to move from player y_1 to player y_2 . For example, if n=7 then the
clockwise distance from 2 to 5 is 3 , and the counterclockwise distance from 2
to 5 is 4 .

Initially, the ball is with the player number x (players are numbered
clockwise). On the i -th move the person with the ball throws it at a distance
of r_i (1 \le r_i \le n - 1 ) clockwise or counterclockwise. For example, if
there are 7 players, and the 2 nd player, after receiving the ball, throws it
a distance of 5 , then the ball will be caught by either the 7 th player
(throwing clockwise) or the 4 th player (throwing counterclockwise). An
illustration of this example is shown below.

The game was interrupted after m throws due to unexpected rain. When the rain
stopped, the guys gathered again to continue. However, no one could remember
who had the ball. As it turned out, Bernard remembered the distances for each
of the throws and the direction for some of the throws (clockwise or
counterclockwise).

Rudolf asks you to help him and based on the information from Bernard,
calculate the numbers of the players who could have the ball after m throws.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m, x (2 \le n \le
1000 , 1 \le m \le 1000 , 1 \le x \le n ) — the number of players, the number
of throws made, and the number of the player who threw the ball first,
respectively.

The next m lines contain information about each throw in order. Each of them
contains an integer r_i (1 \le r_i \le n - 1 ) — the distance at which the i
-th throw was made, and a symbol c_i , equal to '0', '1', or '?':

  * if c_i ='0', then the i -th throw was made clockwise, 
  * if c_i ='1', then the i -th throw was made counterclockwise, 
  * if c_i ='?', then Bernard does not remember the direction and the i -th throw could have been made either clockwise or counterclockwise. 

It is guaranteed that the sum n \cdot m (n multiplied by m ) over all test
cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

In the first line, output the number of players k (1 \le k \le n ) who could
have the ball at the end of the game.

In the next line, output k numbers b_i (1 \le b_i \le n ) — the numbers of the
players in increasing order. All numbers must be different.

def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns a string that is the next line of input from sys.stdin, with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads the next line of input from the standard input (`sys.stdin`), removes any leading and trailing whitespace from the line, and returns the resulting string.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines the set of players who could be the last to throw an object after a series of throws, given the number of players, the number of throws, and the starting player. It prints the number of such players and their identifiers.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The given problem involves determining which players could have the ball after a series of throws where some throws have an unknown direction (clockwise or counterclockwise). The solution uses a set to keep track of all possible positions of the ball after each throw.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.

2. **Processing Throws**:
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it processes the set of possible positions `ans`:
     - If the direction is clockwise (`'0'`) or unknown (`'?'`), it adds the position resulting from a clockwise throw to the temporary set `temp`.
     - If the direction is counterclockwise (`'1'`) or unknown (`'?'`), it adds the position resulting from a counterclockwise throw to the temporary set `temp`.
   - It then updates `ans` to be the set `temp`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If `0` is in the set `ans` (which can happen due to modulo operation), it is replaced with `n` to ensure the player numbers are in the range `[1, n]`.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, it prints the number of possible players who could have the ball and their numbers in increasing order.

### Correctness:

The program correctly handles the problem's requirements and constraints:
- It uses a set to efficiently track all possible positions of the ball after each throw.
- It correctly processes both known and unknown throw directions.
- It handles the edge case where the modulo operation might result in `0` by converting it to `n`.
- It outputs the results in the required format.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided example.

**Correctness: True**
