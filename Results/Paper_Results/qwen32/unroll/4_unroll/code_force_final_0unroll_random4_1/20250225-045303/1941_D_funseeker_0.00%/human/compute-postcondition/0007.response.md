Postcondition: **`n` is the first value returned by `func_3()`, `m` is the second value returned by `func_3()`, `x` is the third value returned by `func_3()`. If `0` is in `ans`, then `ans` is the set of values resulting from the loop transformations with `0` removed and including `n`. Otherwise, `ans` remains the set of values resulting from the loop transformations.**
