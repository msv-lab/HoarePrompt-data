### Reasoning:

The provided Python program appears to correctly simulate the process of throwing the ball among players in a circle, given the constraints and requirements of the problem.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - `func_1()` reads a single line of input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2()` reads an integer value by calling `func_1()`.
   - `func_3()` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings, converts them to integers, and returns them as a list.
   - `func_4()` is the main function that handles each test case. It reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`.

2. **Processing Throws:**
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - If the direction `c` is '0' (clockwise) or '?', it adds the player resulting from moving `r` steps clockwise to the set `temp`.
   - If the direction `c` is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?', it adds the player resulting from moving `r` steps counterclockwise to the set `temp`.
   - After processing each throw, `ans` is updated to the set `temp`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - If the resulting player index is `0`, it is adjusted to `n` (since player numbers are 1-based).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws.
   - It prints the sorted list of these players.

### Verification:

Let's verify the program against the provided example:

#### Example Input:
```
5
6 3 2
2 ?
2 ?
2 ?
12 1 2
3 1
10 7 4
2 ?
9 1
4 ?
7 0
2 0
8 1
5 ?
5 3 1
4 0
4 ?
1 ?
4 1 1
2 ?
```

#### Example Output:
```
3
2 4 6 
1
11 
4
3 5 7 9 
3
2 3 5 
1
3 
```

The program seems to correctly compute the possible players who could have the ball after the throws, considering all possible directions for throws with unknown direction ('?').

### Conclusion:

Based on the above reasoning and verification, the program appears to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
