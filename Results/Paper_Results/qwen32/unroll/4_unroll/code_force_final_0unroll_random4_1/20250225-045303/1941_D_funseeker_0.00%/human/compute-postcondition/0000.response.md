The code snippet provided assigns the values returned by the function `func_3()` to the variables `n`, `m`, and `x`. Therefore, the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` will be updated to whatever `func_3()` returns. Since the specific values returned by `func_3()` are not given, we can only describe the output state in terms of the values returned by the function.

Output State: **`n` is the first value returned by `func_3()`, `m` is the second value returned by `func_3()`, `x` is the third value returned by `func_3()`**.

This means that `n`, `m`, and `x` will hold the values as determined by the function `func_3()`.
