### Reasoning:

The given problem involves determining which players could have the ball after a series of throws where some throws have an unknown direction (clockwise or counterclockwise). The solution uses a set to keep track of all possible positions of the ball after each throw.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.

2. **Processing Throws**:
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it processes the set of possible positions `ans`:
     - If the direction is clockwise (`'0'`) or unknown (`'?'`), it adds the position resulting from a clockwise throw to the temporary set `temp`.
     - If the direction is counterclockwise (`'1'`) or unknown (`'?'`), it adds the position resulting from a counterclockwise throw to the temporary set `temp`.
   - It then updates `ans` to be the set `temp`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If `0` is in the set `ans` (which can happen due to modulo operation), it is replaced with `n` to ensure the player numbers are in the range `[1, n]`.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, it prints the number of possible players who could have the ball and their numbers in increasing order.

### Correctness:

The program correctly handles the problem's requirements and constraints:
- It uses a set to efficiently track all possible positions of the ball after each throw.
- It correctly processes both known and unknown throw directions.
- It handles the edge case where the modulo operation might result in `0` by converting it to `n`.
- It outputs the results in the required format.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided example.

**Correctness: True**
