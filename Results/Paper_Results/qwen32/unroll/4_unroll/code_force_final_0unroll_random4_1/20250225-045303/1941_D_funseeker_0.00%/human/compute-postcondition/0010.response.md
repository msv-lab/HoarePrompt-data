Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `x`, where `n` is the number of players (2 <= n <= 1000), `m` is the number of throws (1 <= m <= 1000), and `x` is the starting player (1 <= x <= n). The function returns the player number who will be the last to throw the object after `m` throws, given that the throws are passed sequentially to the next player in a circular manner starting from player `x`.**
