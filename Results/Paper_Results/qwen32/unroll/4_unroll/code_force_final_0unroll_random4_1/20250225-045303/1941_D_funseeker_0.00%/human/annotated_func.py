#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature. This function does not have any input parameters or return values based on the given code snippet.
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns a string that is the next line of input from sys.stdin, with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads the next line of input from the standard input (`sys.stdin`), removes any leading and trailing whitespace from the line, and returns the resulting string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters, so there are no variables to describe in terms of preconditions.
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())
    #The program returns the integer value returned by `func_1()`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns the integer value returned by `func_1()`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are provided in the function signature of `func_3`. Therefore, no precondition can be derived from the given function signature alone.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer is derived from converting the substrings of the string returned by `func_1()` to integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes no input parameters and returns a list of integers. These integers are obtained by splitting a string returned by `func_1()` into substrings and converting each substring into an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of players (2 <= n <= 1000), m is an integer representing the number of throws (1 <= m <= 1000), and x is an integer representing the starting player (1 <= x <= n).

    #State: `n` is the first value returned by `func_3()`, `m` is the second value returned by `func_3()`, `x` is the third value returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is the set of values resulting from the loop transformations.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: `n` is the first value returned by `func_3()`, `m` is the second value returned by `func_3()`, `x` is the third value returned by `func_3()`. If `0` is in `ans`, then `ans` is the set of values resulting from the loop transformations with `0` removed and including `n`. Otherwise, `ans` remains the set of values resulting from the loop transformations.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: len(ans) (where ans is the set resulting from the loop transformations with 0 removed and n added if 0 was in the set, otherwise ans remains the set from the loop transformations)
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the set of values resulting from the loop transformations with 0 removed and including n if 0 was in ans, otherwise ans remains unchanged)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines the set of players who could be the last to throw an object after a series of throws, given the number of players, the number of throws, and the starting player. It prints the number of such players and their identifiers.
