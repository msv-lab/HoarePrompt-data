### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem by calculating the maximum sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using the allowed operations and then printing the operations. Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. **Sum Calculation:**
   The program calculates the sum using the formula:
   \[
   \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i
   \]
   Simplifying the term inside the summation:
   \[
   i^2 - (i-1)^2 = i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1) = 2i - 1
   \]
   Thus, the sum becomes:
   \[
   \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \cdot i = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i)
   \]
   This formula is correct for calculating the maximum sum of the matrix, as it accounts for the incremental increase in the sum for each row and column operation.

2. **Operations:**
   The program outputs `2n` operations, each of which either sets a row or a column to a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \). Specifically, it performs:
   - \( n \) Type 1 operations (setting rows to permutations).
   - \( n \) Type 2 operations (setting columns to permutations).

   The operations are described by:
   ```
   for j in range(1, n + 1):
       print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
       print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```
   This loop ensures that each row and each column is set to the permutation [1, 2, ..., n], which is a valid permutation and maximizes the sum of the matrix.

3. **Output Format:**
   For each test case, the program correctly outputs:
   - The maximum sum.
   - The number of operations (which is \( 2n \)).
   - The \( 2n \) operations themselves.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and outputs the required number of operations to achieve this sum. It adheres to the constraints and requirements of the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
