### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided solution step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to maximize the sum of an `n x n` matrix using at most `2n` operations.
- Two types of operations are allowed:
  1. Assign a permutation to a row.
  2. Assign a permutation to a column.

#### Solution Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Calculating the Maximum Sum:**
   - The program initializes the sum to 1.
   - It then calculates the sum of squares from 1 to n using the formula: `sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` for `i` from 2 to `n`.
   - This is equivalent to calculating the sum of squares: `1^2 + 2^2 + ... + n^2`, which is correct.

3. **Outputting the Number of Operations:**
   - The program outputs `2n` as the number of operations, which is within the allowed limit.

4. **Generating Operations:**
   - For each row `j` from 1 to `n`, the program performs two operations:
     - Type 1 operation: Assign the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` to the row `n - j + 1`.
     - Type 2 operation: Assign the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` to the column `n - j + 1`.

#### Evaluation of Operations:
- The operations described in the solution are intended to ensure that each number from 1 to n appears exactly n times in the matrix.
- However, the strategy of assigning the same permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` to both rows and columns in a specific order does not guarantee that each number from 1 to n appears exactly n times in the matrix.
- Specifically, the operations as described will not necessarily form a Latin square, where each number from 1 to n appears exactly once in each row and each column.

#### Correct Strategy:
- To form a Latin square, we need to ensure that each number from 1 to n appears exactly once in each row and each column.
- A simple and correct strategy to achieve this is to assign the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` to the first row, `[2, 3, ..., n, 1]` to the second row, and so on, ensuring a cyclic shift for each subsequent row.

#### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly form a Latin square and hence does not guarantee that each number from 1 to n appears exactly n times in the matrix. Therefore, the sum calculated might not be the maximum possible sum.

### Final Answer

Final: **False**
