The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be at least 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1**
