Reasoning:  
The provided program calculates the maximum sum of all the numbers in the matrix and the operations needed to achieve this sum. The program's logic and output format match the problem's requirements. Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of all elements in the matrix is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i
   \]
   Simplifying the inner part of the sum:
   \[
   i^2 - (i-1)^2 = i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1) = 2i - 1
   \]
   Therefore, the sum becomes:
   \[
   \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \cdot i = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i)
   \]
   This can be further simplified to:
   \[
   \text{sum} = 1 + 2\sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 - \sum_{i=2}^{n} i
   \]
   Using the formulas for the sum of squares and the sum of integers:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
   \]
   We can derive:
   \[
   \text{sum} = 1 + 2\left(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 1\right) - \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\right)
   \]
   Simplifying this expression gives:
   \[
   \text{sum} = \frac{n^3 + 3n^2 + 2n}{2} = \frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{2}
   \]
   This matches the expected maximum sum for an n x n matrix.

2. **Operations**: The program performs 2n operations, each of which is either a Type 1 or Type 2 operation. Specifically, it performs n Type 1 operations and n Type 2 operations. The operations are described as follows:
   - For each row `j` from 1 to `n`, it performs a Type 1 operation on row `n-j+1` with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - For each column `j` from 1 to `n`, it performs a Type 2 operation on column `n-j+1` with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

   These operations ensure that each element in the matrix is set to a unique value from 1 to n, maximizing the sum of the matrix.

3. **Output Format**: The output format matches the problem's requirements. For each test case, the program outputs the maximum sum and the number of operations (which is 2n), followed by the descriptions of the operations.

Given the above points, the program correctly calculates the maximum sum and the operations needed to achieve this sum, and it adheres to the problem's constraints and output format.
