To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given conditions and the input values.

The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `k`. It then checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. If true, it prints `1`; otherwise, it prints `n - 1`.

Let's break down what happens in each iteration:
1. If `k >= n - 1`, the output for that iteration is `1`.
2. If `k < n - 1`, the output for that iteration is `n - 1`.

Since the loop processes each test case independently, the final output state will be a sequence of `1`s and `n - 1`s corresponding to each test case.

Given that the state of other variables not affected by the loop (like `t`) remains unchanged, the output state can be described as a series of printed values based on the conditions above.

Therefore, the output state after all the iterations will be a sequence of printed values `1` or `n - 1` for each test case, without changing the value of `t`.

Output State: **a sequence of printed values `1` or `n - 1` for each test case, based on the condition `k >= n - 1`.**
