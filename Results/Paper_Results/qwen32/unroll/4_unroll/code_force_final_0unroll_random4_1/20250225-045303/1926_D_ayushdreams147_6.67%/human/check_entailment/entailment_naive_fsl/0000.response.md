Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The main issue lies in the logic of the `func_1` function, which is supposed to determine the minimum number of groups required such that no two numbers in the same group share any matching bit values from the 1st to 31st bit.

Here's a breakdown of why the code is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Bit Manipulation and Counting Logic**:
   - The code uses `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to flip all the bits of `num` from the 1st to 31st bit. This operation is not relevant to the problem. The problem requires ensuring that no two numbers in the same group have the same bit values in the specified range, not flipping bits.
   - The code then increments the count of the flipped number in the dictionary `count` and increments the result `res` by 1. This logic does not ensure that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit values.

2. **Incorrect Grouping Logic**:
   - The code does not correctly implement the logic to group numbers based on their bit values. It simply increments the result `res` every time it encounters a number that hasn't been seen before in a specific form (flipped bits), which does not guarantee the correct grouping.

3. **Logic to Handle Duplicates**:
   - The code attempts to decrement the count of `num` if it has been seen before, but this logic is flawed and does not correctly handle the grouping requirement.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to use a different approach, such as using a bitmask to track the bits of each number and grouping numbers based on their bit patterns. Here's a sketch of a correct approach:

- Use a dictionary to track the bit patterns of the numbers.
- For each number, convert it to its binary representation and create a bitmask for the 1st to 31st bits.
- Use the bitmask as a key in the dictionary to group numbers that have the same bit pattern.
- The number of unique bit patterns will be the minimum number of groups required.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    seen = set()
    for num in a:
        # Create a bitmask for the 1st to 31st bits
        bitmask = num & ((1 << 31) - 1)
        if bitmask not in seen:
            seen.add(bitmask)
            res += 1
    return res

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))
```

This corrected version uses a set to track unique bit patterns and correctly counts the minimum number of groups required.
