The code snippet initializes a new dictionary named `count`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, or `res`. Therefore, the initial values of `n`, `a`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31; `res` is 0; `count` is an empty dictionary.**
