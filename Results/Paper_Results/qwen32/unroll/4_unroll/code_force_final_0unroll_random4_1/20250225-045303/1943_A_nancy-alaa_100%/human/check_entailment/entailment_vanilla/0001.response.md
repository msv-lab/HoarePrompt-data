Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The game is played on an array `a` of size `n`. Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from `a` and deleting them, with Alice appending her chosen elements to a new array `c`. The goal is to determine the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c` at the end of the game, where Alice aims to maximize the MEX and Bob aims to minimize it.

### Key Observations

1. **MEX Definition**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
2. **Optimal Play**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.
3. **Game Dynamics**:
   - Alice gets to choose which elements to add to `c`.
   - Bob only deletes elements from `a` but does not add any to `c`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.

### Strategy

- **Alice's Strategy**: Alice should aim to add elements to `c` in such a way that the MEX is maximized. This means she should try to add elements that are not already in `c` and are as high as possible.
- **Bob's Strategy**: Bob will try to prevent Alice from achieving a high MEX by deleting elements that Alice might want to pick.

### Analysis of the Provided Program

The provided program attempts to determine the MEX of `c` at the end of the game. However, it does not simulate the game dynamics but rather makes assumptions based on the frequency of elements in the initial array `a`.

Here's the provided program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        first = False
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True
```

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining MEX**:
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the first element with a frequency of 1 in the `Counter` will determine the MEX.
   - It does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob are playing optimally.
   - It does not simulate the turns or the strategic choices of Alice and Bob.

2. **Misunderstanding of Optimal Play**:
   - The program does not consider the sequence of moves and the strategic decisions made by Alice and Bob.
   - It fails to account for the fact that Alice can choose elements strategically to maximize the MEX, and Bob can try to counter her moves.

### Correct Approach

To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the game or determine the MEX based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. However, a key insight is that the MEX of `c` can be determined by the frequency of elements in `a` and the optimal play strategies.

A correct approach would involve:
- Counting the frequency of each element in `a`.
- Determining the smallest index `i` such that the number of elements less than `i` is even, because Alice can always pick elements to ensure that the MEX is maximized given the constraints.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly simulate the game or determine the MEX based on optimal play strategies. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
