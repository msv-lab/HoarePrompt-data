Reasoning:  
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by calculating the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends, given that both players play optimally. However, the code does not correctly simulate the game or determine the optimal moves for Alice and Bob. Instead, it tries to find the smallest non-negative integer that is either not present in the list `arr` or appears exactly once after the first occurrence of any integer that appears exactly once. This approach does not take into account the strategic choices made by Alice and Bob during the game.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the following:
1. Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
2. Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.
3. The optimal strategy involves both players making choices that either maximize or minimize the MEX, respectively.

A correct approach would involve:
- Counting the occurrences of each number in the array `arr`.
- Determining the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in `arr` or appears an odd number of times (since Bob will always be able to pair up numbers that appear an even number of times, leaving Alice to pick the smallest unpaired number).

The provided code does not implement this logic correctly. Instead, it breaks out of the loop as soon as it finds a number that appears exactly once after the first such number, which is not the correct strategy.

Given this analysis, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
