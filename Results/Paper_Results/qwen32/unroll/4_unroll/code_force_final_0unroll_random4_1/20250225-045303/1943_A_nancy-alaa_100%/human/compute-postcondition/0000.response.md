In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the input value `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only contains the underscore `_` and the `range(int(input()))` function, meaning the only state we can adjust is related to the input value `t`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute if `t` is a positive integer.
2. Since `t` is already described as a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4`, it already meets the condition for the loop to execute.
3. No adjustment is needed for `t` as it is already in the correct state.

The state before the loop starts already ensures that the loop will execute because `t` is a positive integer within the specified range. Therefore, no further adjustments are necessary.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4**
