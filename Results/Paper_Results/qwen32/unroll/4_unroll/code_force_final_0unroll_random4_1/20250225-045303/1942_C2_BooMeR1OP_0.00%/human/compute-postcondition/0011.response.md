The code snippet sorts the list `gaps`. Therefore, the elements of `gaps` will be in ascending order after the execution of the code. The values of `ans` and `n` remain unchanged. The other variables and their conditions remain as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`ans` is unchanged, `gaps` is a sorted list of positive differences (minus one) between consecutive elements in `a`, adjusted by `n` for the last element.**
