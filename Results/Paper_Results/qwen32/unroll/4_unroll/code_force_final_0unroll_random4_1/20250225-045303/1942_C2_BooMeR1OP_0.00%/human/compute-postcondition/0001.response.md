The provided Python code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The initial state includes the variables `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y`, as well as the second line of input which consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.

After executing the code, the list `a` will contain these `x` distinct integers. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5); `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; `a` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.**
