The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `numbers`. This action does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, the edges represented by `u` and `v`, or the starting node of the stone. The only change is that `numbers` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers `u` and `v` representing edges of the tree (1 <= `u`, `v` <= `n`), and the last line contains `t` integers representing the starting node of the stone (1 <= `u_1` <= `n`); `numbers` is an empty list.**
