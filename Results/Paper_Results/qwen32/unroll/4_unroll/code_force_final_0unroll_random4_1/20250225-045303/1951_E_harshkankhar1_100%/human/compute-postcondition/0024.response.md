Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `s`: The input string provided by the user.
- `n`: The length of the string `s`.
- `x`: The index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`. `x` is not -1, confirming that there is at least one character in `s` that differs from the first character.
- `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.
- `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
```

### Explanation:
- `s[:x + 2]`: This slice of the string `s` includes all characters from the start of the string up to and including the character at index `x + 1`.
- `s[x + 2:]`: This slice of the string `s` starts from the character at index `x + 2` and goes to the end of the string.

### Detailed Breakdown:
- The first part `s[:x + 2]` includes the initial sequence of characters in `s` up to the character at index `x + 1`. This sequence starts with `s[0]` and includes the first character that differs from `s[0]` (at index `x`) and the character immediately following it (at index `x + 1`).
- The second part `s[x + 2:]` includes the rest of the string starting from the character at index `x + 2` to the end of the string.

### Example to Illustrate:
Suppose `s = "aaabbb"`, then:
- `s[0]` is 'a'.
- `x` would be 2 because `s[2]` is the first character that differs from `s[0]` ('b').
- `s[:x + 2]` is `s[:4]` which is `"aaab"`.
- `s[x + 2:]` is `s[4:]` which is `"bb"`.

### Output:
Given the above explanation, the output will be the concatenation of the two slices with a space in between.

Output: **s[:x + 2] s[x + 2:] (where s[:x + 2] includes the first x + 2 characters of s and s[x + 2:] includes the rest of the characters starting from index x + 2)**

Since the exact string `s` is not provided, we can't compute the exact characters, but we can describe the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **s[:x + 2] s[x + 2:] (where s[:x + 2] includes the first x + 2 characters of s and s[x + 2:] includes the rest of the characters starting from index x + 2)**
