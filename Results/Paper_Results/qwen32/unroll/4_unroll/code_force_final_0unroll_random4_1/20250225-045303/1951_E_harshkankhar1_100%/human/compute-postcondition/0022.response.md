Let's break down the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `s` is the input string provided by the user.
2. `n` is the length of the string `s`.
3. `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`. `x` is not -1, indicating that there is at least one character in `s` that is different from the first character.
4. `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`.
5. `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet only contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The value to be printed is explicitly provided and does not depend on any variables or conditions defined in the initial state.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
