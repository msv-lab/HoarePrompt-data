### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - This function checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing the string to its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
   - If `s` is the same forwards and backwards, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - Reads the input string `s` and calculates its length `n`.
   - Initializes `x` to `-1`.
   - Checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`.
     - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", `1`, and the string `s` itself, and returns.
   - If the entire string `s` is a palindrome, it searches for the first character in `s` that is different from the first character.
     - If all characters are the same (`x` remains `-1`), it prints "NO" and returns.
   - If it finds a different character (`x` is not `-1`), it checks if the substring starting from the character after the first different character (`s[x + 1:]`) is not a palindrome.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", `2`, and the two substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, it checks if `x` is `1` or `n // 2`:
       - If `x` is `1` or `n // 2`, it prints "NO".
       - Otherwise, it prints "YES", `2`, and the two substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles cases where the entire string is not a palindrome by printing "YES", `1`, and the string itself.
- It correctly identifies strings where all characters are the same and prints "NO".
- For strings where the first `x` characters are the same and the rest are not a palindrome, it correctly prints "YES" with the appropriate partition.
- The program also correctly handles cases where the string is a palindrome but can be partitioned into two non-palindrome substrings, except for the specific cases where `x` is `1` or `n // 2`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a string can be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings and prints the correct output for the provided test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The program correctly identifies if a string can be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.
Correctness: **True**
