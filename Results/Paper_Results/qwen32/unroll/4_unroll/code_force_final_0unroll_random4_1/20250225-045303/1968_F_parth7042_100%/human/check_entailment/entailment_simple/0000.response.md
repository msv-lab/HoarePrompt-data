### Reasoning:

The program is structured to solve the problem using prefix XORs and a dictionary to store indices where each prefix XOR value occurs. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes each test case one by one, extracting the number of elements `n`, the number of queries `q`, the array `a`, and the queries themselves.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - A prefix XOR array `pf` is computed where `pf[i]` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to the `i`-th element.
   - A dictionary `mp` maps each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query defined by `l` and `r`, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` using the prefix XOR values: `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
   - If `x` is 0, it means the subarray itself has an XOR of 0, and thus the subarray is trivially interesting, so the program appends 'YES' to the results.
   - If `x` is not 0, the program checks if there are indices `i` and `j` such that `pf[i] = pf[j] = x` and `l <= i < j <= r`. This is done using binary search (`bisect_left`) on the lists in `mp` to find appropriate `i` and `j`.
   - If such `i` and `j` exist, the subarray can be divided into parts with equal XOR, and 'YES' is appended to the results. Otherwise, 'NO' is appended.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all queries for all test cases, the program prints the results.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting by leveraging prefix XORs and efficiently checking for the existence of appropriate indices using binary search. This approach ensures that the solution is both correct and efficient, adhering to the problem constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
