To understand what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer representing the number of test cases. It is given that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **For each test case**:
   - **`n`**: An integer representing the number of elements in the array `a`. It is given that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - **`q`**: An integer representing the number of queries. It is given that \(1 \leq q \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - **`a`**: An array of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
   - **Each query** is defined by two integers `l` and `r` such that \(1 \leq l < r \leq n\).
3. **`data`**: A list of strings obtained by splitting the input line. This is typically used to parse the input data.
4. **`index`**: Updated to the position after the last query of the last test case. This variable is used to keep track of the current position in the input data.
5. **`results`**: A list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on whether there exists a subarray within the range [l, r] whose XOR is 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Explanation:
The `print` statement is using the `join` method to concatenate all elements in the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`). 

### Output Description:
The `results` list contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each query in all test cases. Each 'YES' or 'NO' indicates whether there exists a subarray within the range [l, r] whose XOR is 0 for that specific query.

Since the exact contents of `results` depend on the specific input data (which is not provided in the initial state), we cannot provide a specific numerical output. However, we can describe the output format precisely.

### Final Output:
Output: **'YES' or 'NO' for each query, separated by newlines (where 'YES' indicates that there exists a subarray within the range [l, r] whose XOR is 0, and 'NO' indicates otherwise)**
