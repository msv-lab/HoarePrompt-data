The function `func_1` determines the winner of a game based on the distances from a starting node to two leaf nodes in a tree. It accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes, a list of tuples `edges` representing the tree's edges, and an integer `start` representing the starting node. The function returns 'Ron' if at least one of the distances from the starting node to any two leaf nodes is even, otherwise it returns 'Hermione'.
