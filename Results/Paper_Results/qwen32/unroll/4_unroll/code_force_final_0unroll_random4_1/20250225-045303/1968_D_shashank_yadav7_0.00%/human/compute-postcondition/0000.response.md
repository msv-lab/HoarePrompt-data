Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. For each of the `t` test cases, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` are integers such that 1 <= `P_B`, `P_S` <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^9. `p` is a list of `n` integers where each element `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is now assigned the value of the input, which is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
