Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by simulating the game for each test case. However, there are a few issues in the logic that make the program incorrect.

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores**:
   - The program initializes `bm` and `sm` with `a[b] * k` and `a[s] * k` respectively, which is incorrect. The score should start from `a[b]` and `a[s]` and then accumulate points based on the moves.
   - The loop where the scores are updated is flawed. The lines `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` do not correctly update the scores. The `max` function is unnecessary and the multiplication by `k` is incorrect as it should accumulate scores incrementally, not multiply by the remaining turns.

2. **Index Adjustments**:
   - The program correctly adjusts the indices `b` and `s` by subtracting 1 to convert from 1-based to 0-based indexing, but the logic for updating the scores is flawed.

3. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition `for i in range(n):` is incorrect. The loop should run `k` times, not `n` times, as the game lasts exactly `k` turns.

4. **Initialization of `sp` and `bp`**:
   - `sp` and `bp` should be initialized to `a[s]` and `a[b]` respectively, not `a[s]` and `a[b]` multiplied by `k`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly compute the scores for Bodya and Sasha, leading to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
