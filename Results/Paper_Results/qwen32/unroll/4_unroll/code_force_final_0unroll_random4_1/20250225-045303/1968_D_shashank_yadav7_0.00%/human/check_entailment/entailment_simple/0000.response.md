### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the logic it implements to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjust Indices:**
   - The starting positions `P_B` and `P_S` are adjusted to be zero-based indices by subtracting 1.

3. **Initial Scores:**
   - The initial scores for Bodya (`bp`) and Sasha (`sp`) are set to the values of `a` at their starting positions.

4. **Simulation of Moves:**
   - The program then simulates `k` turns.
   - In each turn, both players either stay or move to the next position in the permutation.
   - The scores are updated based on the value of `a` at the current position.

5. **Incorrect Logic for Score Calculation:**
   - The program incorrectly attempts to update the scores by considering the maximum possible score for each player. However, the logic `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` is flawed.
   - The correct approach should be to add the value of `a` at the current position to the respective score for each player.
   - The use of `max` here is unnecessary and incorrect for the problem's requirements.

6. **Comparison of Scores:**
   - After `k` turns, the program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the winner or "Draw" based on the comparison.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the program is **incorrect** due to the flawed logic in updating the scores. The correct approach should be to simply add the value of `a` at the current position to the respective score for each player in each turn.

### Correctness: **False**
