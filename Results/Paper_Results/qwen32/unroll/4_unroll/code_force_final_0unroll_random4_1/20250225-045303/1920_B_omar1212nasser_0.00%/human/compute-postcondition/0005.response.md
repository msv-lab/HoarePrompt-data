The code calculates the sum of the last `negatives` elements of the list `elements` and assigns this sum to the variable `n`. The other variables (`removals`, `elements`, `pos`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is an empty list, `s` is the sum of `elements`, and either `removals` is not equal to 6 or `negatives` is not equal to 3; `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements`.**
