Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules described. The game described is a variant of the Nim game, where the key to determining the winner is to use the concept of the Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes). If the Nim-sum is zero at the start, the second player (Bob) wins with optimal play; otherwise, the first player (Alice) wins.

Here is a correct implementation based on the Nim-sum concept:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nim_sum = 0
        for stones in arr:
            nim_sum ^= stones
        if nim_sum == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This program calculates the Nim-sum of the stones in all piles and determines the winner based on whether the Nim-sum is zero or not.
