Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` such that `1 <= k <= m <= n`. It also accepts two lists, `a` and `b`, where `a` contains `n` integers and `b` contains `m` integers, with each integer in both lists ranging from 1 to 10^6. The function processes these inputs and returns a value for each test case based on the provided constraints.**
