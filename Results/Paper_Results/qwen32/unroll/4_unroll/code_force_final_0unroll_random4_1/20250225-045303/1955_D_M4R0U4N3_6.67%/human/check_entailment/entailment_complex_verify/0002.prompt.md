You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

    #State: A list of integers, where each integer represents the number of valid windows for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and lists `a` and `b`. For each test case, it determines the number of contiguous subarrays of length `m` in list `a` that contain at least `k` elements from list `b`. It outputs the count of such subarrays for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The given program aims to solve the problem by using a sliding window approach. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It creates a set `todo` containing the elements of `b` that need to be matched.
   - It initializes two sets, `done` and `extra`, to keep track of the elements in the current window of length `m` that are in `b` and those that are not, respectively.

2. **First Window**:
   - The program processes the first window of length `m` in array `a`.
   - For each element in the first window, it checks if the element is in `todo` (i.e., it is one of the elements in `b` that we need to match).
     - If it is, the element is moved from `todo` to `done`.
     - If it is not, the element is added to `extra`.
   - It then checks if the size of `done` is at least `k`. If so, it increments the answer `ans`.

3. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program then slides the window one element to the right at a time from position `m` to `n-1`.
   - For each new position `r`:
     - It removes the element at position `r - m` from the window.
       - If the removed element is in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`.
       - If the removed element is in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added back to `todo`.
     - It adds the new element at position `r` to the window.
       - If the new element is in `todo`, it is moved from `todo` to `done`.
       - If the new element is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`.
     - It checks if the size of `done` is at least `k`. If so, it increments the answer `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all windows, the program prints the number of good subsegments for the current test case.

### Issues in the Program:
The program uses sets to track elements, which does not account for the frequency of elements. This means that if `b` contains duplicate elements, the program will not correctly count them. For example, if `b = [1, 1, 2]` and a subsegment of `a` contains `[1, 1, 2]`, the program will only count one `1` in `done` because sets do not allow duplicates.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not handle duplicate elements in `b` correctly. It should use dictionaries or `Counter` objects to keep track of the frequency of elements instead of sets.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
