In this case, the `while` loop is `while True:`, which means the loop will always execute at least once regardless of the program state. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state for the loop to proceed to its first iteration.

State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list at index `i` contains the 0-based indices of all vertices directly connected to vertex `i`; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as computed by the `bfs(a)` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to each vertex as computed by the `bfs(a)` function; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`.**
