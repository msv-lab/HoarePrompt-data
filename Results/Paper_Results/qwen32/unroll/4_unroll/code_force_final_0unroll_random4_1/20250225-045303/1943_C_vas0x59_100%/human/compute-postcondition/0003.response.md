The given loop reads `n-1` pairs of integers from the input, where each pair represents an edge between two vertices in an undirected tree. The vertices are initially numbered from 1 to `n`, but the code adjusts the indices to be 0-based by subtracting 1 from each vertex number. For each edge `(u, v)`, the code appends `v` to the adjacency list of `u` and `u` to the adjacency list of `v` in the `u2vs` list of lists.

After the loop has executed all `n-1` iterations, the `u2vs` list will contain the adjacency lists for each vertex in the tree. Each entry `u2vs[i]` will be a list of all vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i` by an edge.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list at index `i` contains the 0-based indices of all vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree.**
