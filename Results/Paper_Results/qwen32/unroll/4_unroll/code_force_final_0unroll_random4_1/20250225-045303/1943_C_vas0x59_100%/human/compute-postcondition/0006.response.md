Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list at index `i` contains the 0-based indices of all vertices directly connected to vertex `i`; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as computed by the `bfs(a)` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to each vertex as computed by the `bfs(a)` function.**

Natural Language: After executing the code, `d` is updated to contain the shortest distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as determined by the `bfs(a)` function. The variable `previous` is introduced and contains the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to each vertex. The variables `u2vs` and `a` remain unchanged.
