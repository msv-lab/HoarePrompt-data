Precondition: **u2vs is a list of lists where each inner list contains the indices of vertices adjacent to the vertex at the respective index in u2vs, representing the adjacency list of an undirected tree. n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and it is guaranteed that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^3.**
