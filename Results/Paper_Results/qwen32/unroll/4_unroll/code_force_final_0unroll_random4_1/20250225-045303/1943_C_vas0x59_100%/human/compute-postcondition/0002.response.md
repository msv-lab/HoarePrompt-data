The only object in the loop head of the provided `for` loop is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that is not used within the loop body. The loop will execute based on the range `n - 1`. Therefore, the state of `n` is the only thing that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute.

Given that `n` is guaranteed to be in the range 1 to 2 * 10^3, the loop `for _ in range(n - 1)` will execute `n - 1` times. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1. If `n` is 1, the range will be `0`, and the loop will not execute.

Thus, to ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, `n` must be at least 2**
