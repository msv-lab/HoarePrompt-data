t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, and test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50, and the second element is a list p of n integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [0, n-1], and all p_i are distinct.
