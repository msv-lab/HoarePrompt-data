The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer value from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50. After executing the code, the value of `n` will be whatever integer is provided as input, but it will still satisfy the condition 2 <= n <= 50. The variables `t` and `p` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i, and all p_i are distinct.**
