Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge connecting vertices a and b in the tree, and `g` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index i contains all vertices directly connected to vertex i by an edge.`**
