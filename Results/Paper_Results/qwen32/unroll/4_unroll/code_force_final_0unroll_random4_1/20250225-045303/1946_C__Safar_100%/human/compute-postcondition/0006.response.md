To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the loop condition `l <= r`. 

Given:
- `l` is initialized to 1.
- `r` is initialized to `n // k`.

The loop condition `l <= r` must be true for the loop to execute. Since `l` is initialized to 1, `r` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Let's analyze the initialization of `r`:
- `r` is set to `n // k`.
- For `r` to be at least 1, `n // k` must be at least 1.
- This means `n` must be at least `k` because integer division `n // k` will be at least 1 only if `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Given that `1 <= k < n`, `n // k` should naturally be at least 1. However, to ensure the loop condition `l <= r` is met, we need to confirm that `r` is indeed at least 1. Since `l` is 1, `r` should be at least 1, which is already guaranteed by the condition `1 <= k < n`.

Therefore, no specific adjustments are needed to the state of `n` or `k` as long as they satisfy the given constraints. The state of `l` and `r` is already set up correctly.

State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge connecting vertices a and b in the tree, `g` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index i contains all vertices directly connected to vertex i by an edge, `c` is 0, `l` is 1, and `r` is `n // k`**
