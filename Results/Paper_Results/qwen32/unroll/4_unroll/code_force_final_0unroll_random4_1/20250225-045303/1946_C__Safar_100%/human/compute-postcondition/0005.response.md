The value of `r` is calculated as `n // k`, which is the integer division of `n` by `k`. The other variables `n`, `k`, `edges`, `g`, `c`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Given that `n` is the number of vertices, `k` is the number of edges to be removed, `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges, `g` is an adjacency list, `c` is 0, and `l` is 1, the only change is the assignment of `r`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge connecting vertices a and b in the tree, `g` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index i contains all vertices directly connected to vertex i by an edge, `c` is 0, `l` is 1, and `r` is `n // k`.**
