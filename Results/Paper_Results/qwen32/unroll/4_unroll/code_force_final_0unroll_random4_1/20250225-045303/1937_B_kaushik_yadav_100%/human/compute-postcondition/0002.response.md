In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range based on the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only contains the variable `_` and `t`. Since the loop iterates `t` times, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `t` itself. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Head Analysis**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. This means the loop will execute `t` times.
2. **Dependencies**: The loop's execution depends solely on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once.
3. **Adjustments**: To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. The value of `_` does not need to be adjusted as it is automatically assigned by the `range` function during each iteration.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure it is greater than 0. The state of `t` is derived from the input, and no other variables in the loop head need modification.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
