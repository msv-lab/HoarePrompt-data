You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

. There are two paths that yield this string:

    #State: For each test case, the output consists of the constructed string `ans` followed by the count of consecutive matches.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two binary strings of equal length. For each test case, it constructs a new string based on specific rules and prints this string followed by the count of consecutive matching characters starting from the first position of the constructed string.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
1. **Objective**: Find the lexicographically smallest string by choosing any available path from the top-left to the bottom-right cell in a 2xN grid filled with 0s and 1s.
2. **Path Constraints**: The grasshopper can only move right or downward.
3. **Output**: For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string.

### Program Analysis:

#### Step 1: Construct the Lexicographically Smallest String
The program constructs the lexicographically smallest string by iterating through the grid and choosing the smaller value between the current cell in row 1 and the cell directly below it in row 2. The logic is:
- Initialize an empty string `ans`.
- Start from the first column.
- If the current cell in row 1 (`a[i]`) is smaller than the cell in row 2 directly below it (`b[i]`), add `a[i]` to `ans`.
- If `b[i]` is smaller or equal, add `b[i]` to `ans` and switch to the next column.
- Continue this process until reaching the last column.

#### Step 2: Count the Number of Paths that Yield the Smallest String
The program counts the number of paths that yield the smallest string by:
- Initialize a counter to 1.
- Iterate through the grid from the first column to the second last column.
- If the next cell in row 1 (`a[j+1]`) is equal to the current cell in row 2 (`b[j]`), increment the counter.
- If `a[j+1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', reset the counter to 1.
- If neither condition is met, break the loop.

### Correctness Analysis:
1. **Lexicographically Smallest String**:
   - The algorithm correctly constructs the lexicographically smallest string by always choosing the smaller value between the two available options at each step.
   - The logic to switch rows based on the comparison of adjacent cells is sound.

2. **Counting the Number of Paths**:
   - The algorithm correctly counts the number of paths that yield the smallest string by checking if the next cell in row 1 is equal to the current cell in row 2.
   - However, the logic to reset the counter when `a[j+1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1' is incorrect. This condition does not guarantee a reset of the count. Instead, the counter should reset whenever a different path starts yielding a different string.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the lexicographically smallest string but incorrectly counts the number of paths that yield this string. Therefore, the program is not entirely correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
