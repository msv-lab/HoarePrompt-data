### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

#### Problem Recap:
Monocarp wants to invite his friends to a party such that at least two of them come. For a friend `i` to come, both `i` and their best friend `p_i` must receive invitations.

#### Program Analysis:
The program iterates over multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list `p` of best friends. It then checks if there is a pair of friends `i` and `p_i` such that `p[p_i - 1] == i + 1`. If such a pair exists, it prints `2`, indicating that only two invitations are needed. If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

#### Key Points:
1. **Checking for Mutual Best Friends:**
   - The program checks if there exists an `i` such that `p[p_i - 1] == i + 1`. This condition is equivalent to checking if `i` and `p_i` are mutual best friends, meaning `p_i` is the best friend of `i` and `i` is the best friend of `p_i`.
   - If such a mutual pair is found, the program correctly concludes that only two invitations are needed for both friends to attend the party.

2. **Handling Cases Without Mutual Best Friends:**
   - If no mutual best friends are found, the program concludes that at least three invitations are needed. This is because, in the absence of mutual best friends, it might be necessary to invite three friends to ensure that at least two of them and their respective best friends come to the party.

#### Example Verification:
- **First Test Case:**
  - Input: `5`, `3 1 2 5 4`
  - The program finds that `p[4] = 5` and `p[5] = 4`, indicating that `4` and `5` are mutual best friends. Therefore, it prints `2`.

- **Second Test Case:**
  - Input: `4`, `2 3 4 1`
  - There are no mutual best friends. The program correctly prints `3`.

- **Third Test Case:**
  - Input: `2`, `2 1`
  - The friends are mutual best friends. The program correctly prints `2`.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the scenarios described in the problem. It accurately identifies when two invitations are sufficient (when there are mutual best friends) and when three invitations are necessary (when there are no mutual best friends).

### Correctness: **True**
