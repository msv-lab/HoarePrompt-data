Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. Each integer `p_i` in the list `p` satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i != i. The function returns the number of fixed points in the permutation `p` for each test case, where a fixed point is an index `i` such that p_i = i. If there are no fixed points, it returns 0 for that test case.**
