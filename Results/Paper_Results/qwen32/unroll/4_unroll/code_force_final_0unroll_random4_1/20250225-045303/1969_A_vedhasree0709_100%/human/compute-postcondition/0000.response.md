In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the input value `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the range `int(input())`. The variables `n` and `p` are mentioned to describe the context within each test case but are not part of the loop head itself.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that the input value `t` is such that `int(input())` will yield a value greater than or equal to 1. This is because the loop will execute `t` times, and for it to execute at least once, `t` must be at least 1.

Given that the state before the loop starts already specifies that `1 <= t <= 5000`, this condition is already satisfied. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000**
