In the given task, the `while` loop condition is `while t:`. In Python, a non-zero integer is considered `True` in a boolean context, and zero is considered `False`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be a non-zero integer.

Given the state right before the `while` loop is `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, this state already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. Any integer within this range is non-zero, so no adjustment is needed.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
