Reasoning:
The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The task is to determine the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. The beauty can be maximized by arranging the array in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This is achieved by sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

However, the provided program sorts the array and prints it in ascending order without calculating the beauty of the array. It does not compute the sum of the differences between consecutive elements as required by the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not provide the correct output as per the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
