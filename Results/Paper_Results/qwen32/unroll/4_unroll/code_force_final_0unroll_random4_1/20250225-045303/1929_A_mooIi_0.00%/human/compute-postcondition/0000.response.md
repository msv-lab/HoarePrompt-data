The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. The loop iterates `int(input())` times, which means the number of iterations is determined by the input value `t`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `int(input())` returns a value that is at least 1. Given the state provided, `t` is already an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, which means `int(input())` will indeed be a valid number of iterations for the loop to execute.

Therefore, no adjustment to the state is needed for the loop to execute. The state provided already ensures that the loop will run `t` times.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9**
