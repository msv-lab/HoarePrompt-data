Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to rearrange the elements of an array to maximize its "beauty," which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. The goal is to maximize this sum.

2. **Optimal Strategy**: To maximize the sum of differences, the optimal arrangement of the array is to sort it in non-decreasing order. This way, each difference (a_i - a_{i-1}) will be as large as possible.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements.
   - It sorts the array in ascending order.
   - It prints the sorted array elements as a space-separated string.

4. **Mismatch in Output Requirement**: The program sorts and prints the array elements, but it does not compute and print the beauty of the array, which is the required output. The beauty of the array should be calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after sorting.

5. **Correctness**: The program correctly sorts the array, which is a step towards the solution, but it does not compute the beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirement of the problem.

The original assessment is accurate. The program sorts the array correctly but fails to compute and print the beauty of the array, which is the required output.

Final: **False**
