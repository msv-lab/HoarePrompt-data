Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to determine the minimum number of tents required to accommodate all participants based on their preferences. The constraints are:
- Each introvert must be in a tent alone.
- Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two others.
- Universals can be in a tent alone, with one other person, or with two others.

### Solution Breakdown

The solution consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

#### Function 1: `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`

This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals, considering the constraints.

- If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, it checks if the remaining extroverts and universals can form a group of 3. If not, it returns `None` (indicating it's impossible to accommodate).
- If the number of extroverts is a multiple of 3, or if the remaining extroverts and universals can form a group of 3, it calculates the number of tents required using the formula `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

#### Function 2: `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`

This function calculates the total number of tents required for all participants.

- It first calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
- If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the participants, so it returns `-1`.
- Otherwise, it returns the sum of the tents needed for introverts (which is equal to the number of introverts, as each must be in a tent alone) and the tents needed for extroverts and universals.

### Correctness Check

Let's verify if the solution correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement.

1. **Test Case 1: `1 2 3`**
   - Introverts: 1
   - Extroverts: 2
   - Universals: 3
   - Tents for extroverts and universals: `ceil((2 + 3) / 3) = 2`
   - Total tents: `1 (introverts) + 2 = 3`
   - **Correct**

2. **Test Case 2: `1 4 1`**
   - Introverts: 1
   - Extroverts: 4
   - Universals: 1
   - Tents for extroverts and universals: `ceil((4 + 1) / 3) = 2`
   - Remaining extroverts after forming 2 tents: `4 - 6 = -2` (impossible)
   - **Correct (returns -1)**

3. **Test Case 3: `1 4 2`**
   - Introverts: 1
   - Extroverts: 4
   - Universals: 2
   - Tents for extroverts and universals: `ceil((4 + 2) / 3) = 2`
   - Total tents: `1 (introverts) + 2 = 3`
   - **Correct**

4. **Test Case 4: `1 1 1`**
   - Introverts: 1
   - Extroverts: 1
   - Universals: 1
   - Tents for extroverts and universals: `ceil((1 + 1) / 3) = 1`
   - Remaining extroverts after forming 1 tent: `1 - 3 = -2` (impossible)
   - **Correct (returns -1)**

5. **Test Case 5: `1 3 2`**
   - Introverts: 1
   - Extroverts: 3
   - Universals: 2
   - Tents for extroverts and universals: `ceil((3 + 2) / 3) = 2`
   - Total tents: `1 (introverts) + 2 = 3`
   - **Correct**

6. **Test Case 6: `19 7 18`**
   - Introverts: 19
   - Extroverts: 7
   - Universals: 18
   - Tents for extroverts and universals: `ceil((7 + 18) / 3) = 8`
   - Total tents: `19 (introverts) + 8 = 27`
   - **Incorrect (should be 28)**

   **Error Explanation:** The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the case where the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3 and there are not enough universals to form a group of 3 with the remaining extroverts. In this case, it should form as many groups of 3 as possible and then handle the remaining extroverts and universals separately.

7. **Test Case 7: `0 0 0`**
   - Introverts: 0
   - Extroverts: 0
   - Universals: 0
   - Tents for extroverts and universals: `ceil((0 + 0) / 3) = 0`
   - Total tents: `0 (introverts) + 0 = 0`
   - **Correct**

8. **Test Case 8: `7 0 0`**
   - Introverts: 7
   - Extroverts: 0
   - Universals: 0
   - Tents for extroverts and universals: `ceil((0 + 0) / 3) = 0`
   - Total tents: `7 (introverts) + 0 = 7`
   - **Correct**

9. **Test Case 9: `0 24 0`**
   - Introverts: 0
   - Extroverts: 24
   - Universals: 0
   - Tents for extroverts and universals: `ceil((24 + 0) / 3) = 8`
   - Total tents: `0 (introverts) + 8 = 8`
   - **Correct**

10. **Test Case 10: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`**
    - Introverts: 1000000000
    - Extroverts: 1000000000
    - Universals: 1000000000
    - Tents for extroverts and universals: `ceil((1000000000 + 1000000000) / 3) = 666666667`
    - Total tents: `1000000000 (introverts) + 666666667 = 1666666667`
    - **Correct**

### Conclusion

The program is incorrect due to the issue identified in Test Case 6. The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the case where the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3 and there are not enough universals to form a group of 3 with the remaining extroverts.

**Correctness: False**
