### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program based on the problem description and the provided function summaries.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Introverts (a)**: Each introvert must be in a tent by themselves.
2. **Extroverts (b)**: Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two others.
3. **Universals (c)**: Universals can be in a tent with 0, 1, or 2 others.

#### Conditions for Tents:
- Each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.
- The number of tents needed must satisfy the conditions for introverts and extroverts.
- Universals can fill in the gaps to meet the requirements.

#### Analysis of the Program:
The program consists of two functions:
1. **func_1(extroverts, universals)**: This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals. It returns `None` if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and there aren't enough universals to fill the gaps.
2. **func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals)**: This function uses `func_1` to get the number of tents for extroverts and universals. If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of tents for introverts and the result from `func_1`.

Let's examine the logic in `func_1` and `func_2`:

- **func_1(extroverts, universals)**:
  - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it checks if the sum of `extroverts % 3` and `universals` is less than 3. If so, it returns `None` because we cannot form a complete tent with the remaining extroverts and universals.
  - Otherwise, it calculates the number of tents required for extroverts and universals using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

- **func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals)**:
  - It calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)`.
  - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns -1.
  - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of tents for introverts (`introverts`) and the result from `func_1`.

#### Correctness Check:
Let's go through the provided examples to see if the program works correctly:

1. **Example 1**: `1 2 3`
   - Introverts: 1 tent
   - Extroverts: 2 extroverts + 1 universal = 1 tent (2 extroverts + 1 universal = 3 people in one tent)
   - Total: 2 tents
   - `func_1(2, 3)` returns 1, `func_2(1, 2, 3)` returns 2 (Incorrect, should be 3)
   
   **Issue**: The program should return 3 because we need 1 tent for the introvert and 2 tents for the extroverts and universals (one tent with 2 extroverts and 1 universal, and another tent with 2 universals).

2. **Example 2**: `1 4 1`
   - Introverts: 1 tent
   - Extroverts: 4 extroverts + 1 universal = Not possible to form complete tents
   - `func_1(4, 1)` returns None, `func_2(1, 4, 1)` returns -1 (Correct)

3. **Example 3**: `1 4 2`
   - Introverts: 1 tent
   - Extroverts: 4 extroverts + 2 universals = 2 tents
   - Total: 3 tents
   - `func_1(4, 2)` returns 2, `func_2(1, 4, 2)` returns 3 (Correct)

4. **Example 4**: `1 1 1`
   - Introverts: 1 tent
   - Extroverts: 1 extrovert + 1 universal = Not possible to form complete tents
   - `func_1(1, 1)` returns None, `func_2(1, 1, 1)` returns -1 (Correct)

5. **Example 5**: `1 3 2`
   - Introverts: 1 tent
   - Extroverts: 3 extroverts = 1 tent
   - Total: 2 tents
   - `func_1(3, 2)` returns 1, `func_2(1, 3, 2)` returns 2 (Incorrect, should be 3)
   
   **Issue**: The program should return 3 because we need 1 tent for the introvert and 2 tents for the extroverts and universals (one tent with 3 extroverts, and another tent with 2 universals).

6. **Example 6**: `19 7 18`
   - Introverts: 19 tents
   - Extroverts: 7 extroverts + 18 universals = 8 tents
   - Total: 27 tents
   - `func_1(7, 18)` returns 8, `func_2(19, 7, 18)` returns 27 (Incorrect, should be 28)
   
   **Issue**: The program should return 28 because we need 19 tents for the introverts and 9 tents for the extroverts and universals (2 tents with 3 extroverts each, and 3 tents with 2 extroverts and 1 universal each, and 4 tents with 3 universals each).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly calculate the number of tents in all cases. Specifically, it does not account for the need to form additional tents when the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, even if there are enough universals to fill the gaps.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
