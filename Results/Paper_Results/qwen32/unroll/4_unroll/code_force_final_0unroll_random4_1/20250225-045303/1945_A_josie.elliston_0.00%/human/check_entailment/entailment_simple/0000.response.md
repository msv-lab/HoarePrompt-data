### Reasoning:
Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to determine its correctness.

**Problem Breakdown:**
1. **Tents for Introverts:** Each introvert must be alone in a tent, so `a` tents are needed for the introverts.
2. **Tents for Extroverts:** Each extrovert wants to be in a tent with two others. Therefore, the number of extroverts must be divisible by 3 for them to be accommodated fully. If not, we need to check if the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals to make groups of 3. If it's impossible, the function should return `-1`.
3. **Tents for Universals:** Universals can be in any type of tent. They can fill the remaining spots in tents for extroverts or be in tents alone.

**Function Analysis:**
- **`func_1(extroverts, universals)`**:
  - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and any additional universals required to form groups of 3.
  - If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 (`extroverts % 3 != 0`), it checks if the remaining extroverts plus universals can form a group of 3 (`extroverts % 3 + universals >= 3`). If not, it returns `None`.
  - If the condition is met, it calculates the number of tents needed as the ceiling of `(extroverts + universals) / 3`.

- **`func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals)`**:
  - This function calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
  - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate all extroverts according to their preferences, so it returns `-1`.
  - Otherwise, it returns the sum of tents needed for introverts (`introverts`) and the tents needed for extroverts and universals (`ret`).

**Example Walkthrough:**
- For the input `1 2 3`:
  - `func_1(2, 3)` calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals. Since `2 % 3 != 0` and `2 % 3 + 3 >= 3`, it calculates `ceil((2 + 3) / 3) = 2`.
  - `func_2(1, 2, 3)` returns `1 + 2 = 3`.

- For the input `1 4 1`:
  - `func_1(4, 1)` calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals. Since `4 % 3 != 0` and `4 % 3 + 1 < 3`, it returns `None`.
  - `func_2(1, 4, 1)` returns `-1`.

**Conclusion:**
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents required or if it's impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.

### Correctness: **True**
