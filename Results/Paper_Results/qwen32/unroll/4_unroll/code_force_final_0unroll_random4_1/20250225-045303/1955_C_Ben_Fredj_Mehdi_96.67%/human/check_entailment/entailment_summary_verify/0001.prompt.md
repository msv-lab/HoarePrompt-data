You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it prints a specific value based on predefined conditions or calculates the count of zeros in the list `a` after performing decrement operations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to solve the problem of determining how many ships are sunk after the Kraken's attacks. However, the program contains several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Hardcoded Answers**: The program contains numerous hardcoded answers for specific values of `n` and `k`, which is not a valid approach for a general solution. These hardcoded cases do not handle all possible inputs and thus the program will not work correctly for inputs that are not covered by these specific cases.

2. **Incorrect Logic in the Loop**: The loop intended to simulate the Kraken's attacks has some issues. It tries to reduce the durability of the first and last ships alternately but does not correctly handle the situation when the first and last ships are the same (which can happen if `n` is odd and `k` is large). Additionally, the loop does not correctly handle the case when `k` is odd, and the middle ship (if `n` is odd) is attacked an odd number of times.

3. **Inefficient Handling of Large `k`**: The loop runs `k // 2` times, which can be inefficient for large values of `k` (up to \(10^{15}\)). The program should handle large `k` more efficiently by calculating the number of attacks each ship receives based on its position and the value of `k`.

4. **Incorrect Counting of Sunk Ships**: The program uses `a.count(0)` to count the number of sunk ships, which is inefficient and unnecessary if the program correctly tracks the number of sunk ships as it simulates the attacks.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all possible inputs as described in the problem statement.
