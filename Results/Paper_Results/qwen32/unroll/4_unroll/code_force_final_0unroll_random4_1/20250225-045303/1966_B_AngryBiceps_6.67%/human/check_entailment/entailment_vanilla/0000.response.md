To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze the problem and the implementation step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem asks whether it's possible to make all squares in a grid the same color using a specific operation. The operation allows you to select two squares of the same color and change all squares within the subrectangle defined by these two points to that color.

### Key Observations
1. **Single Color Check**: If all squares in the grid are already the same color, the answer is trivially "YES".
2. **Grid Transformation**: The operation can only change the color of squares within a subrectangle. To change the color of the entire grid, you need to be able to select pairs of squares such that the resulting subrectangle operations can eventually cover the entire grid.
3. **Corner Cases**:
   - If the grid has only one row or one column, the problem simplifies to checking if all elements in that row or column are the same.
   - If the grid has multiple rows and columns, the key is to check if the first and last rows/columns can be used to propagate the color change across the grid.

### Implementation Analysis
The provided code does the following:
1. For each test case, it reads the grid dimensions and the grid itself.
2. It constructs two strings: `first_row` (consisting of the first column of each row) and `last_row` (consisting of the last column of each row).
3. It checks two conditions:
   - If all elements in the first row are the same and the first row is different from the last row, it prints "NO".
   - If all elements in `first_row` (the first column of each row) are the same and `first_row` is different from `last_row`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Correctness Analysis
- The code correctly identifies scenarios where it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color by checking the first and last rows and columns.
- However, it does not fully cover all possible scenarios. For example, if the grid has a pattern where the first and last rows/columns are the same, but the grid cannot be fully transformed due to internal patterns, the code might incorrectly output "YES".

### Counterexample
Consider the following grid:
```
2 3
WBW
BWB
```
- Here, the first row and last row are different (`WBW` and `BWB`), so the code would output "NO" based on the first condition.
- However, the grid can be transformed to all 'W' or all 'B' by selecting appropriate subrectangles.

### Conclusion
The provided code does not handle all possible scenarios correctly. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
