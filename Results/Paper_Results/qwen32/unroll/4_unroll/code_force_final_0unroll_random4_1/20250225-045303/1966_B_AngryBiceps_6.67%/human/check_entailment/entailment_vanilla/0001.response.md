Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
The problem asks whether it's possible to make all squares in a grid the same color using the specified operations. The operation allows selecting any two squares of the same color and changing all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.

### Program Analysis:
The program takes multiple test cases and processes each one as follows:
1. It reads the dimensions of the grid (n and m).
2. It reads the grid row by row.
3. It constructs two strings:
   - `first_row`: the first character of each row.
   - `last_row`: the last character of each row.
4. It checks if the first row has all the same characters and is different from the last row. If so, it prints "NO".
5. It checks if the first column (constructed from `first_row`) has all the same characters and is different from the last column (constructed from `last_row`). If so, it prints "NO".
6. If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "YES".

### Correctness Analysis:
The program's logic is based on the observation that if the first and last rows (or columns) are different and consist of only one color, it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color. However, this logic is not sufficient to cover all cases.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the following grid:
```
2 3
BWW
WBW
```
- The first row is "BWW" and the last row is "WBW". Both have more than one unique character, so the program would print "YES".
- However, it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color using the given operations. We cannot change the middle column to be all 'B' or all 'W' while keeping the rest of the grid consistent.

Another example:
```
3 3
BWW
WBW
BWW
```
- The first row is "BWW" and the last row is "BWW", which are the same.
- The first column is "BWB" and the last column is "WWB", which are different and each has more than one unique character, so the program would print "YES".
- However, it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color using the given operations.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all scenarios and can produce incorrect results. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
