### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it's possible to make all squares in a grid the same color using a specific operation. The operation allows coloring a subrectangle with the same color as the selected squares.

The provided program seems to check the following conditions:
1. If the first row is uniform (all 'W' or all 'B') and different from the last row, it prints "NO".
2. If the first column is uniform (all 'W' or all 'B') and different from the last column, it prints "NO".
3. Otherwise, it prints "YES".

Let's analyze why these conditions are sufficient and necessary:

- **First and Last Row Check**: If the first row and the last row are different and both are uniform (all 'W' or all 'B'), it's impossible to make the entire grid uniform because there will always be a row that cannot be changed to match the others without affecting the uniformity of the first or last row.
  
- **First and Last Column Check**: Similarly, if the first column and the last column are different and both are uniform, it's impossible to make the entire grid uniform because there will always be a column that cannot be changed to match the others without affecting the uniformity of the first or last column.

If neither of these conditions is met, it means there is at least one row or column that is not uniform or the first and last rows/columns are the same, which implies that it is possible to make the entire grid uniform by a series of operations.

Thus, the provided program correctly implements the necessary and sufficient conditions to determine if the entire grid can be made the same color.
