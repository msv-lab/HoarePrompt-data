In the given for loop, the loop variable is `_` and it iterates over the range of an integer value derived from `input()`. For the loop to execute, the integer value obtained from `input()` must be at least 1. This integer value represents the number of test cases (`t`), which is already stated to be such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that the input value is at least 1.

The state of `t` is already described as an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, which means the loop will execute as long as the input provided to `int(input())` matches this condition. However, since we are only allowed to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and the loop head only involves the underscore `_` and the result of `int(input())`, we need to ensure that the input is correctly set to a value that allows the loop to run.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and the input to int(input()) must be an integer greater than or equal to 1**.

Since `t` is already defined as being within the valid range, we can simplify this to just ensuring the input is valid for the loop to start:

State: **The input to int(input()) must be an integer greater than or equal to 1**.
