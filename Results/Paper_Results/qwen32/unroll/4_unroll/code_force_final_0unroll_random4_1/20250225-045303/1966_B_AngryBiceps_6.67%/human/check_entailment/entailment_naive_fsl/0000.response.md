Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the described operations. Let's analyze the logic and find a counterexample.

The program checks the following conditions:
1. If all characters in the first row are the same (`len(set(a[0])) == 1`) and the first row is not the same as the last row (`a[0] != a[-1]`), it prints "NO".
2. If all characters in the first column (`first_row`) are the same (`len(set(first_row)) == 1`) and the first column is not the same as the last column (`first_row != last_row`), it prints "NO".
3. Otherwise, it prints "YES".

However, these conditions are not sufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made the same color. Consider the following counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
3 3
WBW
BWB
WBW
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation:**
In this grid, the first row is "WBW" and the last row is also "WBW", so the first condition is not met. Similarly, the first column is "WBW" and the last column is also "WBW", so the second condition is not met. Therefore, the program will print "YES", but it is not possible to make all squares the same color using the described operations.

The correct approach would involve checking if there is a way to connect all 'W's or all 'B's in the grid such that they can be transformed into a single color using the described operations. This typically involves checking if the grid can be divided into regions of the same color that can be transformed into each other.

Since the provided program does not handle this correctly, it is incorrect.
