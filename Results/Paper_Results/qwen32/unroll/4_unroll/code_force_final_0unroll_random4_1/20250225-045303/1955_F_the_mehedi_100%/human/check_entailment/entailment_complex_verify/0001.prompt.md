You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains four integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = 0
        
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: a series of integers, each representing the computed `cnt` value for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on these counts. The calculated value is determined by adding 1 if all counts of ones, twos, and threes are odd, and then adding half the value of each count (rounded down) to this sum.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The game revolves around the bitwise XOR of a sequence of integers. Alice wins if the XOR of the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins. Eve's goal is to maximize the number of times Bob wins, which means she should try to remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as many times as possible.

The key observation here is that:
- XOR of two identical numbers is zero.
- XOR of a number with itself an even number of times is zero.
- XOR of a number with itself an odd number of times is the number itself.

Given the numbers in the sequence are limited to 1, 2, 3, and 4, the strategy for Eve is to remove numbers in such a way that pairs of identical numbers are removed, maximizing the chances of the XOR being zero.

### Conditions for Bob to Win

1. **Initial Condition**: If the XOR of all numbers is zero, Bob wins immediately.
2. **Subsequent Rounds**: Eve removes one number at a time. Bob wins if, after each removal, the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

### Strategy for Eve

- If the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd, then the initial XOR is non-zero, and Bob can win once by removing one of these numbers to make the counts even, leading to a zero XOR.
- Eve should aim to remove pairs of identical numbers to keep the XOR zero for as many rounds as possible.

### Calculation of Maximum Wins for Bob

- If the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd, Bob can win once by making one of these counts even.
- For each type of number (1, 2, 3, 4), Eve can remove pairs, contributing to Bob's wins. Specifically, for each type of number, the number of pairs is `floor(count / 2)`.

### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win by:
1. Checking if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd. If so, it increments the count by 1.
2. For each type of number, it adds `floor(count / 2)` to the count, which corresponds to the number of pairs that can be removed.

This logic is correct for determining the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.

### Conclusion

The logic in the program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the optimal strategy for Eve. Therefore, the program is correct.
