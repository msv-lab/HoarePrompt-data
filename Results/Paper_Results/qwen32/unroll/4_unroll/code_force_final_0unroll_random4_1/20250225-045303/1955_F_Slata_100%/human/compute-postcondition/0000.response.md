The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop iterates `int(input())` times. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value `t` which determines the number of iterations.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The values of `p_i` (the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours) do not affect the execution of the loop itself, as they are not part of the loop head.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
