Let's examine the provided program and see if it correctly determines the outcome of the game based on the rules described.

### Analysis

1. **Understand the Game Rules:**
   - Alice can move down, down-left, or down-right.
   - Bob can move up, up-left, or up-right.
   - Alice wins if she lands on Bob's position.
   - Bob wins if he lands on Alice's position.
   - The game ends in a draw if neither player can make a move or if they can't reach each other.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Alice's position is `(a, b)`, Bob's position is `(c, d)`.
   - Alice wins if she can reach Bob's position before Bob reaches Alice's position.
   - If Alice is initially above Bob (`a < c`), she has a chance to win.
   - If Alice is initially on the same row or below Bob (`a >= c`), the game will end in a draw unless certain positions allow Alice to catch up in one move.

3. **Program Logic:**
   - If `a > c`, Alice cannot move up to Bob's row, so the game is a draw.
   - If `a < c`, Alice can potentially move towards Bob.
     - Compute `x = abs(a - c) // 2`: This is the maximum number of rows Alice can move towards Bob.
     - If `abs(a - c) % 2` is true (i.e., `a - c` is odd), Alice can move to a range of columns `[max(1, d - x), min(w, d + x)]` in the row `a + x`.
       - Check if Bob can move to any of these columns in his next move. If not, Alice wins.
     - If `abs(a - c) % 2` is false (i.e., `a - c` is even), Alice can move to a range of columns `[max(1, b - x), min(w, b + x)]` in the row `a + x`.
       - Check if Bob can move to any of these columns in his next move. If not, Bob wins.

4. **Program Implementation:**
   - The program correctly computes the ranges and checks if the players can move to those positions.
   - The ternary-like syntax `print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[condition])` and `print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[condition])` is used to print the result based on the conditions.

### Conclusion

The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the game's outcome based on the provided rules and observations. Therefore, the correctness of the program is as follows:

Correctness: **True**
