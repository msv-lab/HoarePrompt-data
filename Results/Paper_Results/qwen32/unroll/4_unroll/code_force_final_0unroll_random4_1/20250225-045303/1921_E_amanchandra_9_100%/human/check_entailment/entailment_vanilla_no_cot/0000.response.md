Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the given rules and conditions. Let's analyze the logic and identify the issues:

1. **Initial Condition Check**: The program first checks if `a > c` (Alice's row > Bob's row). If this is true, it immediately prints "Draw". This is incorrect because the game can still be won by either player even if Alice starts in a lower row than Bob.

2. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates `x = abs(a - c) // 2`, which represents half the distance between Alice and Bob's rows. This is used to determine the range of columns Bob or Alice can reach in `x` moves.

3. **Odd vs Even Distance**: The program then checks if the distance between Alice and Bob's rows is odd or even:
   - If the distance is odd, it calculates the range of columns Bob can reach in `x + 1` moves and checks if Alice's column is within this range.
   - If the distance is even, it calculates the range of columns Alice can reach in `x` moves and checks if Bob's column is within this range.
   
   The logic for determining the winner based on this range is flawed. The program does not correctly account for the optimal moves that each player can make to win or force a draw.

4. **Output**: The program uses tuple indexing to print either "Alice" or "Draw" or "Bob" based on the conditions, but the logic leading to these outputs is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
To determine the winner, we need to consider the following:
- If Alice can reach Bob's position before Bob can reach Alice's position, Alice wins.
- If Bob can reach Alice's position before Alice can reach Bob's position, Bob wins.
- If neither can reach the other's position, the game ends in a draw.

The correct logic involves checking the minimum number of moves each player needs to reach the other's position, considering the allowed moves (down, down-left, down-right for Alice, and up, up-left, up-right for Bob).

Given the complexity of the problem, a correct solution would involve more detailed analysis of the positions and possible moves, which the provided program does not correctly implement.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
