Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `h` and `w` are positive integers such that 1 <= `h` <= 10^6 and 1 <= `w` <= 10^9; `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `x_a`, `x_b` <= `h` and 1 <= `y_a`, `y_b` <= `w`; It is guaranteed that either `x_a` != `x_b` or `y_a` != `y_b`. The sum of `h` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to be an integer input by the user, while the other variables (`h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`) and their constraints remain unchanged.
