Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code and the logic it uses.

The code uses the following logic:
1. If Alice's row (`a`) is greater than Bob's row (`c`), it immediately prints "Draw".
2. If Alice's row is not greater than Bob's row, it calculates `x` as half the distance between Alice's and Bob's rows.
3. If the distance between Alice's and Bob's rows is odd, it calculates the range `[l, r]` where Bob can move to in the next turn and checks if Alice can move into this range in her next turn. If yes, it prints "Alice"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".
4. If the distance between Alice's and Bob's rows is even, it calculates the range `[l, r]` where Alice can move to in the next turn and checks if Bob can move into this range in his next turn. If yes, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".

However, there are several issues with this logic:
- The immediate "Draw" when `a > c` is incorrect. Alice can still win or force a draw depending on the column positions and the board dimensions.
- The calculations for `l` and `r` do not correctly account for the boundaries of the board.
- The conditions for determining the winner or a draw are not correctly implemented.

Let's consider a specific case where the code fails:
- Suppose the board is 3x3, Alice is at (1, 1), and Bob is at (3, 3).
- The code will incorrectly print "Draw" because `a < c`, but Alice can move to (2, 2) on her first turn, and then Bob will be forced to move to (2, 2) on his turn, resulting in Alice's win.

Thus, the program does not correctly determine the outcome of the game for all potential cases, making it incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
