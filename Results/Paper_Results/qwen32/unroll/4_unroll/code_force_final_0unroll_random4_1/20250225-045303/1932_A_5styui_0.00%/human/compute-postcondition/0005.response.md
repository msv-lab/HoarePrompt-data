Functionality: **The function reads an integer `a` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `d` (which is not used) and a string `b` of length `n` consisting of '.', '@', and '*'. It counts the number of '@' characters in the string `b` until it encounters a '*' character, then prints this count and resets the count for the next test case.**
