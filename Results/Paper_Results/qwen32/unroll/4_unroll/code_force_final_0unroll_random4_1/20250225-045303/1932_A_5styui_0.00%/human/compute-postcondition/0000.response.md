The code snippet `a = int(input())` assigns the integer value of the input to the variable `a`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `path` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their values remain as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `path` is a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '@', and '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.'; `a` is an input integer.**
