### Reasoning:

The provided Python program correctly calculates the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts given the two pricing options: buying single yogurts at `a` burles each or buying two yogurts at `b` burles.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Single Yogurt Pricing (`a * n`)**: This is straightforward. If Maxim buys each yogurt individually, the total cost is simply the number of yogurts (`n`) multiplied by the price of one yogurt (`a`).

2. **Promotional Pricing (`b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`)**: This accounts for buying yogurts in pairs at the promotional price `b`. The expression `b * n // 2` calculates the cost for the maximum number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought. If `n` is odd, there will be one yogurt left over, which is bought at the regular price `a`. This is represented by `a * n % 2`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles the case when `n` is 1. In this scenario, it simply prints `a` because buying a single yogurt cannot be done using the promotion.

4. **Iterating Over Test Cases**: The program iterates over the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case independently, which is consistent with the problem description.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions. It has been verified to handle the example cases provided in the problem description accurately.

**Correctness: True**
