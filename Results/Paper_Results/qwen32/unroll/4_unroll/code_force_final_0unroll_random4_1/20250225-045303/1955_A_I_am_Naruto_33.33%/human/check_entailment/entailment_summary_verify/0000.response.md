### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description and the function summary provided.

1. **Handling `n > 1`**:
   - The program calculates `ans1` as `a * n`, which is the cost if all yogurts are bought individually.
   - The program calculates `ans2` as `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`, which is the cost if yogurts are bought in pairs where possible, and any remaining yogurt is bought individually.
   - The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

2. **Handling `n == 1`**:
   - If `n` is 1, the program correctly handles this case by printing `a`, which is the cost of one yogurt.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary accurately describes the logic of the program. It mentions that the cost is determined by either `a * n` or `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`, whichever is smaller, unless `n` is 1, in which case the cost is simply `a`.

4. **Testing**:
   - Let's verify the test cases provided in the problem statement:
     - **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
       - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
       - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9`
       - Minimum cost: `9`
     - **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
       - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
       - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 18 + 5 = 23`
       - Minimum cost: `15`
     - **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
       - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
       - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 22 + 5 = 27`
       - Minimum cost: `15`
     - **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
       - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
       - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 22`
       - Minimum cost: `20`

The program produces the correct outputs for the given examples. The original assessment is accurate in stating that the program correctly handles all possible cases and calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts by considering both individual and promotional prices.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the function summary provided.

**Final: True**
