Let's carefully review the program and the annotated version to ensure the correctness of the original assessment.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective**: Determine the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy exactly `n` yogurts.
- **Pricing**:
  - One yogurt costs `a` burles.
  - Two yogurts cost `b` burles (promotion price).
- **Input**:
  - Number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- **Output**:
  - For each test case, print the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it calculates the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts using the provided prices `a` and `b`.

Here's the provided program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)
```

### Evaluation:
1. **Handling `n > 1`**:
   - `ans1` calculates the cost if all yogurts are bought individually: `a * n`.
   - `ans2` calculates the cost if yogurts are bought in pairs where possible:
     - `b * (n // 2)` accounts for the cost of buying `n // 2` pairs.
     - `a * (n % 2)` accounts for the cost of the remaining yogurt if `n` is odd.
   - The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

2. **Handling `n == 1`**:
   - If `n` is 1, the only option is to buy one yogurt for `a` burles.
   - The program correctly handles this case with `print(a)`.

### Testing:
Let's test the program with the provided example inputs:
```
4
2 5 9
3 5 9
3 5 11
4 5 11
```
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
  - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9`
  - Minimum cost: `9`
- **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 18 + 5 = 23`
  - Minimum cost: `15`
- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 22 + 5 = 27`
  - Minimum cost: `15`
- **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
  - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 22`
  - Minimum cost: `20`

The program produces the expected outputs for the given examples.

### Annotated Code:
```python
#State of the program right before the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)
        
    #State: After processing all t test cases, the program will have printed the minimum cost for each test case based on the given formulae. The variables t, n, a, b, ans1, and ans2 will no longer hold their initial values as they are updated in each iteration of the loop. The state of other variables not mentioned in the loop remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum cost based on the given criteria. The cost is determined by either `a * n` or `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`, whichever is smaller, unless `n` is 1, in which case the cost is simply `a`. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the calculated minimum cost for each one.
```

### Conclusion:
The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points and the logic used to determine the minimum cost. The program handles all edge cases correctly and produces the expected output for the provided examples.

### Final Evaluation:
**Final: True**

The original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.
