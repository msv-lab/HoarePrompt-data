You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and a, b, and c are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Let's examine the issues with the code and provide a counterexample.

### Issues with the Code:
1. **Logic for Matching Template**:
   - The code checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, and if so, it immediately prints "NO". This is correct because if `c` is exactly the same as `a` or `b`, there cannot be a template where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.
   - However, the logic for checking if there exists a valid template is flawed. The code checks if any character in `c` is not in `a` and `b`. This is not sufficient to determine if a valid template exists. The template can have uppercase letters that force `c` to not match while allowing `a` and `b` to match.

2. **Template Matching Logic**:
   - The code does not correctly implement the template matching logic as described in the problem statement. It does not consider the case where the template can have uppercase letters that enforce `c` to not match while `a` and `b` can still match.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
2
ab
ac
aa
```
- **Expected Output**: "YES"
  - Template "Aa" would work because:
    - 'a' in `a` matches 'A' in the template (since 'A' is uppercase, `a` can be anything except 'a', but in this case, it is 'a' which is allowed as long as `c` has a different character).
    - 'b' in `a` matches 'a' in the template (since 'a' is lowercase, it must be 'a').
    - 'a' in `b` matches 'A' in the template (since 'A' is uppercase, `a` can be anything except 'a', but in this case, it is 'a' which is allowed as long as `c` has a different character).
    - 'c' in `b` matches 'a' in the template (since 'a' is lowercase, it must be 'a').
    - 'a' in `c` does not match 'A' in the template (since 'A' is uppercase, it cannot be 'a').

- **Actual Output**: "NO"
  - The code incorrectly prints "NO" because it does not properly check for the existence of a valid template.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
