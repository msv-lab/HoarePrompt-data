To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the implications of the variables involved.

### Initial State Recap:
- `s1` is unchanged (we don't know its exact value, but it's mentioned for completeness).
- `pre` is unchanged (similarly, we don't know its exact value, but it's mentioned for completeness).
- `totalOne` is initialized to 0.
- `preOne` is initialized as an empty list.
- `suffZero` contains cumulative sums of indices of '<' characters in some string or list (we don't know the exact string or list, but we know it contains cumulative sums).
- `ans` contains computed values based on loop conditions (we don't know the exact loop conditions or computations, but we know it contains some computed values).

### Analysis:
The `print(*ans)` statement will print all elements of the `ans` list separated by spaces.

Since we don't have the exact loop conditions or computations that populate the `ans` list, we can't determine the exact numerical values that will be printed. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can say that `ans` contains some computed values that are the result of some operations performed within the loop.

### Conclusion:
Given the information provided, we can describe the output as the contents of the `ans` list, which are the results of some computations performed during the execution of the loop.

Output: **[contents of ans] (where ans contains computed values based on the loop conditions)**
