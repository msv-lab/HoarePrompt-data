### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to understand if it meets the requirements.

The problem requires us to determine how many seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each cell in the grid, given the initial configuration of the grid and movement rules.

#### Detailed Breakdown:

1. **Grid Movement Rules:**
   - If the pinball is on the i-th cell and the cell contains '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second.
   - If the pinball is on the i-th cell and the cell contains '>', the pinball moves one cell to the right in the next second.
   - After the pinball moves, the character in the cell is inverted (i.e., '<' becomes '>' and vice versa).
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid (either from the left or right border).

2. **Function `func_2` Explanation:**
   - `func_2` takes a string `s1` of length `n` and computes the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.
   - It initializes two lists: `pre` and `suffZero`.
     - `pre` stores the indices of cells containing '>'.
     - `suffZero` is initialized with a single element `0` and keeps track of cumulative sums of indices of cells containing '<'.
   - It iterates over the string `s1` from the end to the beginning.
   - Depending on whether the current character is '<' or '>', it calculates the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid using the helper function `func_1`.
   - `func_1` calculates the difference between the last time step in the list `arr` and the time step at a position determined by `times`.

3. **Function `func_1` Explanation:**
   - `func_1` calculates and returns the difference between the last time step in the list `arr` and the time step at a position determined by `times`.
   - If `times` is greater than or equal to the length of `arr`, it compares the last element with the first element.

#### Verification:

The provided code appears to be correctly implementing the rules of pinball movement and calculating the required number of seconds for each cell. The use of `accumulate` and the logic in `func_1` and `func_2` align with the problem's requirements.

However, given the complexity and the need for precise calculations, let's consider potential edge cases and ensure the code handles them correctly:

- **Edge Cases:**
  - A grid with all '<' or all '>' characters.
  - A grid with alternating '<' and '>' characters.
  - A grid with a single cell.
  - A grid with a large number of cells.

The provided code seems to handle these cases correctly based on the logic described. The use of `accumulate` and the specific logic in `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to efficiently compute the required values.

### Conclusion:

Based on the provided code and the problem description, the functions together appear to correctly solve the problem as intended.

**Correctness: True**
