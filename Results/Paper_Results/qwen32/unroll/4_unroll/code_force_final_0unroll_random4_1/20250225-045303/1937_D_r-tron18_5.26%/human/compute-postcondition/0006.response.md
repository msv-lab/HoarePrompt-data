To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's break down the operations step by step and understand the transformations applied to the variables.

### Initial State Recap:
- `s1`: A string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>'.
- `pre`: A list of 1-based indices where the character '>' appears in `s1`.
- `totalOne`: The number of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `preOne`: A list generated by accumulating `pre` with an initial value of 0.
- `suffZero`: A list with a single element `0`.
- `ans`: A list of length `n` with all elements initialized to `0`.

### Loop Execution:
The loop iterates from `i = n-1` to `i = 0` (inclusive). Depending on whether `s1[i]` is '>' or '<', different operations are performed on the variables.

#### Case 1: `s1[i] == '>'`
- `ol` is set to `totalOne` (number of '>' remaining).
- `zr` is set to `len(suffZero) - 1` (number of '<' encountered so far).
- Depending on whether `ol <= zr`, different calculations are done:
  - If `ol <= zr`:
    - `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.
    - `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.
    - `ans[i]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd`.
  - If `ol > zr`:
    - `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * suffZero[-1]`.
    - `oneInd` is calculated as `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`.
    - `fi` is calculated as `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`.
    - `ans[i]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`.
- `preOne.pop()` removes the last element from `preOne`.
- `totalOne` is decremented by 1.

#### Case 2: `s1[i] == '<'`
- `suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)` appends the cumulative sum of '<' indices.
- `ol` is set to `totalOne`.
- `zr` is set to `len(suffZero) - 1`.
- Depending on whether `zr <= ol`, different calculations are done:
  - If `zr <= ol`:
    - `zeroInd` is calculated as `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`.
    - `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.
    - `ans[i]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.
  - If `zr > ol`:
    - `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`.
    - `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * preOne[-1]`.
    - `ans[i]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd`.

### Final State:
- `s1` remains unchanged.
- `pre` remains unchanged.
- `totalOne` becomes 0 since all '>' characters are processed.
- `preOne` becomes an empty list since all elements are popped.
- `suffZero` contains cumulative sums of indices of '<' characters.
- `ans` contains the computed values based on the conditions described.

### Output State:
Output State: **`s1` is unchanged, `pre` is unchanged, `totalOne` is 0, `preOne` is [], `suffZero` contains cumulative sums of indices of '<' characters, `ans` contains computed values based on the loop conditions.**
