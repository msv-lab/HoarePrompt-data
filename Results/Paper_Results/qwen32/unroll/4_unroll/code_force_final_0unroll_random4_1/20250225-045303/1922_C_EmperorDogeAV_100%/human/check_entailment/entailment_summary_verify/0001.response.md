### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program and the function summary in the context of the problem description:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, the number of cities `n`, the positions of the cities `cities`, the number of queries `m`, and the queries themselves.

2. **Closest City Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the closest city for each city in the given list. However, the function summary and the implementation have issues:
     - The function summary incorrectly states that the function accepts a list of lists `cities`, whereas the actual implementation takes a single list of city positions.
     - The function calculates the distance to the previous and next city correctly but does not handle the comparison between the two distances properly.
     - The function should set the value in `prog_cities` to `1` if the next city is closer, and to `-1` if the previous city is closer. If the distances are equal, the problem guarantees that the closest city is unique, so this case should not occur.
     - The current implementation sets the value to the distance to the next city if it is not closer, which is incorrect.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are calculated based on the incorrect closest city distances. Since the distances are not correctly determined, the prefix sums will not correctly represent the minimum cost to travel between cities using the closest city strategy.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program determines whether to use the forward or backward prefix sums based on the order of the cities in the query.
   - It calculates the cost of traveling between the cities using the prefix sums. However, since the prefix sums are incorrect, the calculated costs will also be incorrect.

### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Closest City Calculation**: The function `func_1` does not correctly determine the closest city for each city.
- **Incorrect Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sums are based on incorrect closest city distances.
- **Incorrect Query Handling**: The calculated costs for queries are incorrect due to the incorrect prefix sums.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the closest city calculation and the subsequent prefix sum calculation, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
