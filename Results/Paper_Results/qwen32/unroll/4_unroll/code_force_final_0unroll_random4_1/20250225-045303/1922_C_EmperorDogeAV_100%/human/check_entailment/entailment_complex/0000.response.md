### Reasoning

Let's break down the program and see if it correctly solves the problem as described:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the list of city coordinates `cities`, and the number of queries `m`.

2. **Closest City Calculation:**
   - It calculates the closest city for each city using the `func_1` function, both in the forward and backward directions.
   - `forward_cities` is computed by considering the closest city in the forward direction.
   - `backward_cities` is computed by reversing the list and then using `func_1` again, which essentially calculates the closest city in the backward direction.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - `pref_sum_f` is a prefix sum array of `forward_cities`, which helps in quickly calculating the cost of traveling between cities using the closest city in the forward direction.
   - `pref_sum_b` is a prefix sum array of `backward_cities`, which helps in quickly calculating the cost of traveling between cities using the closest city in the backward direction.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program determines whether to use the forward or backward prefix sum array based on the relative positions of the cities.
   - It then calculates the cost using the appropriate prefix sum array.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function computes the closest city for each city (except the last one) in the given direction.
   - It checks whether the forward neighbor is closer than the backward neighbor and sets the value accordingly.

### Issues in the Program

- **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:**
  - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the closest city for each city. However, it incorrectly calculates the distance to the forward neighbor when the forward neighbor is not closer. Instead, it should always return `1` when the forward neighbor is closer, and `abs(forward - cities[i])` when the backward neighbor is closer.
  - The correct implementation should be:
    ```python
    def func_1(cities, n):
        prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
        for i in range(n - 1):
            back = -99999999999999999999
            forward = 999999999999999999
            if i > 0:
                back = cities[i - 1]
            if i < n - 1:
                forward = cities[i + 1]
            
            if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
                prog_cities[i] = 1
            else:
                prog_cities[i] = abs(cities[i] - back)
        return prog_cities
    ```
  - Note that the `forward` and `backward` distances should be compared correctly, and the correct distance should be stored in `prog_cities`.

- **Incorrect Prefix Sum Calculation:**
  - The prefix sums are calculated based on the incorrect logic in `func_1`. Therefore, the prefix sums will also be incorrect, leading to incorrect results for the queries.

### Conclusion

The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in the `func_1` function, which affects the prefix sum calculations and, consequently, the results of the queries.

**Correctness: False**
