Functionality: **The function accepts a list of lists `cities`, where each sublist contains integers representing the coordinates of cities in ascending order, and an integer `n` representing the number of cities in the sublist. It calculates, for each city in the sublist except the last one, whether the forward neighbor is closer or the distance to the forward neighbor if it is not closer. The function returns a list `prog_cities` of length `n - 1` where each element is either 1 (if the forward neighbor is closer) or the distance to the forward neighbor (if the forward neighbor is not closer).**
