cities is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers representing the coordinates of cities in ascending order, n is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of cities in the corresponding sublist of cities, and for each sublist in cities, the length of the sublist matches the corresponding integer in n. Each sublist in cities has at least 2 cities, and the coordinates of the cities are unique and in ascending order. The function go_through is expected to handle multiple test cases, where the total number of cities across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
