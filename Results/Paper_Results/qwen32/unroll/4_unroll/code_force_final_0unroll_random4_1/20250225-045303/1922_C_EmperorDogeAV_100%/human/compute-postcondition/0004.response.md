Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `cities`, a list of lists where each sublist contains integers representing the coordinates of cities in ascending order, and `n`, a list of integers where each integer represents the number of cities in the corresponding sublist of `cities`. For each test case, the function calculates the minimum travel cost between pairs of cities based on the given constraints and returns a list `prog_cities` for each test case. This list contains elements that are either 1 (indicating the forward neighbor is closer) or the distance to the forward neighbor (if the forward neighbor is not closer).**
