### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the logic used to determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it.

1. **Odd Dimensions:** 
   - If both dimensions `a` and `b` are odd, then cutting the rectangle will always result in two rectangles with at least one dimension being 1 (since we can only cut parallel to the sides, and cutting an odd number into two parts will always result in one part being even and the other being odd, or both being odd with one being 1). These two resulting rectangles cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle different from the original, because the only possible new rectangle would have dimensions involving 1, which would be the same as the original dimensions when rotated (e.g., 1x(odd) cannot form anything different from 1x(odd)). Therefore, if both `a` and `b` are odd, the answer is 'NO'.

2. **One Dimension is Double the Other:**
   - If one dimension is double the other, say `a = 2b`, then cutting the rectangle along the longer side will result in two rectangles of dimensions `b x b`. These two squares can only form a rectangle of dimensions `b x 2b`, which is the same as the original rectangle when rotated. Therefore, if one dimension is double the other, the answer is 'NO'.

3. **All Other Cases:**
   - For all other cases, it is possible to cut the rectangle in such a way that the resulting two rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle. For example, if `a` and `b` are both even, or if one is even and the other is odd, we can always cut the rectangle and rearrange the pieces to form a different rectangle.

The program correctly implements this logic:
- It checks if both `a` and `b` are odd. If so, it prints 'NO'.
- It checks if one dimension is double the other. If so, it prints 'NO'.
- For all other cases, it prints 'YES'.

The execution summary matches this reasoning and the logic is correctly implemented in the code.
