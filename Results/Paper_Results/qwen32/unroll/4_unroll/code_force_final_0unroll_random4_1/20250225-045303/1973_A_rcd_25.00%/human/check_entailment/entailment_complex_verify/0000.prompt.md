You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

    #State: the initial values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. For each test case, it determines and prints a value based on the scores. If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the maximum possible score that can be achieved by a player under the given constraints.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues:

The code attempts to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened based on the scores of the three players. However, there are specific scenarios where the code fails to provide the correct output.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
0 0 2
```
In this case, the scores are 0, 0, and 2. This means that one player must have won two games against the other two players, and no draws could have occurred. However, the code will output 0 for this case, which is incorrect.

Another problematic test case is:
```
1
1 1 4
```
Here, the scores are 1, 1, and 4. This is impossible because the maximum points a player can get is 6 (if they win all three games). The code will output 1 for this case, which is incorrect.

Let's look at the code logic again:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            (low, high) = (min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2))
            cur = low
            while high >= cur:
                if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                    print(p1 - cur + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    cur += 1
            else:
                print(p3)
```

The code checks if the sum of the scores is even, which is a good start. However, it does not correctly handle cases where the scores are not achievable with a valid set of games. For example, it does not check if the scores exceed the maximum possible points (6 points if a player wins all three games).

The logic for calculating the maximum number of draws is also flawed. The code does not correctly account for all possible combinations of wins and draws that could lead to the given scores.

To fix these issues, the code needs to include additional checks for the validity of the scores and a more robust method for calculating the maximum number of draws.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to these edge cases.
