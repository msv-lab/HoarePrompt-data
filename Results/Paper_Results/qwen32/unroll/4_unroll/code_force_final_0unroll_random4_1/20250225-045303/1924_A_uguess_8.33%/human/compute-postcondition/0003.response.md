Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s`. The integer `t` satisfies 1 <= t <= 10^5. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, and `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000. The string `s` has a length of `m` and consists only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The sum of `m` and the sum of `n` over all test cases do not exceed 10^6. The function returns a result for each test case based on the provided inputs.**
