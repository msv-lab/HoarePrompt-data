You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        cnt = 0
        cur = 0
        for ss in s:
            cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
            if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
                cur += 1 << cur_ss
            if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
                cnt += 1
                cur = 0
        if cnt >= n:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            tmp = ''
            ans = chr(ord('a') + k - 1) * cnt
            for i in range(k):
                if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                    tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
            ans += tmp
            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` contains at least `n` distinct combinations of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If it does, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a string of length `n` using the available characters, ensuring the maximum number of distinct combinations are included.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully examine the given problem and the provided solution to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to determine whether all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the string `s`. If not, we need to provide one such string that does not occur as a subsequence.

### Key Points:
- A string `a` is a subsequence of another string `b` if `a` can be obtained by deleting some characters from `b` without changing the order of the remaining characters.
- We need to check for all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` letters of the alphabet.

### Analysis of the Provided Solution:
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem by counting how many different subsets of the first `k` letters appear in `s` as subsequences. However, it does not correctly count all possible strings of length `n`. Instead, it counts how many different subsets of the first `k` letters appear in `s` as subsequences and then makes an incorrect assumption about the number of strings of length `n`.

#### Issues in the Solution:
1. **Counting Subsets Instead of Strings**: The solution counts how many different subsets of the first `k` letters appear in `s` as subsequences. It uses a bitmask to track which letters have been seen. However, this does not equate to counting all possible strings of length `n`.
2. **Incorrect Construction of Non-Subsequence String**: When the solution constructs a string that does not appear as a subsequence, it does so incorrectly. It uses the count of subsets and the bitmask to construct a string, but this approach does not guarantee that the constructed string is the shortest non-subsequence string of length `n`.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the provided solution is incorrect. It does not correctly determine whether all possible strings of length `n` appear as subsequences and it does not correctly construct a non-subsequence string when necessary.

### Correctness: **False**

To solve this problem correctly, a different approach would be needed, such as generating all possible strings of length `n` and checking each one against `s` to see if it is a subsequence. However, this approach would be computationally expensive for larger values of `n` and `k`.

Since the task is to evaluate the correctness of the provided solution, the final answer is:

Correctness: **False**
