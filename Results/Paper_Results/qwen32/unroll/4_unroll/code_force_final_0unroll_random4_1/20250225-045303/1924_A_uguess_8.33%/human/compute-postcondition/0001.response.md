For the provided task, the for loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0 since `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 up to, but not including, `t`. 

Given the state before the loop starts is `t` is an input integer, 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, we can see that `t` is already within a range that ensures the loop will execute at least once (since `t` is at least 1). The variable `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts as it is initialized by the `range` function in the loop head.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state of `t` or `i` for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer, 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `i` is not yet initialized (will be initialized by the loop head)**

Since the task specifies only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, and `t` is already in a valid state, no changes are necessary.
