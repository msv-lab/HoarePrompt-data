You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

    t = int(input())

        cnt = 0
        cur = 0
        for ss in s:
            cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
            if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
                cur += 1 << cur_ss
            if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
                cnt += 1
                cur = 0

            ans += tmp
            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
            print(ans)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Counting Full Sets of Characters**:
   - The code uses a bitmask `cur` to keep track of the characters seen so far. When `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` characters have been seen in the current subsequence.
   - The variable `cnt` is incremented each time a full set of `k` characters is seen, but it does not ensure that all possible permutations of length `n` have been seen as subsequences.

2. **Generating Missing Subsequence**:
   - When the program determines that not all subsequences are present, it attempts to generate a missing subsequence.
   - The logic for generating the missing subsequence is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that the remaining characters in `cur` can be used to form a valid missing subsequence.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider a simple counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
2 3 6
abcabc
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
ab
```

**Explanation:**
- The string `s` is `abcabc`.
- All possible strings of length `2` using `a`, `b`, and `c` are: `aa`, `ab`, `ac`, `ba`, `bb`, `bc`, `ca`, `cb`, `cc`.
- The string `s` does not contain the subsequences `aa`, `ac`, `ba`, `bb`, `bc`, `ca`, `cb`, `cc` as complete subsequences.
- The program should output `NO` and any one of the missing subsequences, such as `aa`.

**Actual Output:**
The provided program will likely output `YES` because it only checks if all characters have been seen at least once in the string, not if all possible subsequences of length `n` are present.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to check for all possible subsequences of length `n` and generate a correct missing subsequence when necessary. Therefore, the correctness is `False`.
