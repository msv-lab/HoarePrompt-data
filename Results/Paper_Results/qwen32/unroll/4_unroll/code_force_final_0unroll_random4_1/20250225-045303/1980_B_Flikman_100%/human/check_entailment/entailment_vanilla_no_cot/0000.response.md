Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine if the favorite cube will always be removed, never be removed, or may be either removed or left. The issue lies in the logic used to determine the output based on the `removed_count` and `favorite_count`.

### Explanation of the Issue:
- The program counts how many times the favorite cube's value appears in the top `k` sorted cubes (`removed_count`).
- It also counts how many times the favorite cube's value appears in the entire sorted list (`favorite_count`).

The output logic is incorrect:
- If `removed_count == favorite_count`, it prints 'YES'. However, this condition is only true if all cubes with the favorite value are among the first `k` cubes, which is not necessarily the case. For example, if there are 5 cubes with the favorite value and `k=4`, it could be that only 4 of those are in the first `k` cubes, but one is not, so the favorite cube might not always be removed.
- If `removed_count == 0`, it prints 'NO', which is correct because it means the favorite cube's value is not in the first `k` cubes.
- If `0 < removed_count < favorite_count`, it prints 'MAYBE', which is also correct because it means some cubes with the favorite value are in the first `k` cubes, but not all, so it could be removed or not.

### Correct Logic:
- To determine if the favorite cube will always be removed, `removed_count` should be at least 1, and there should be no cubes with the favorite value after the first `k` cubes.
- To determine if the favorite cube will never be removed, `removed_count` should be 0.
- Otherwise, it is 'MAYBE'.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, f, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        favorite_value = a[f - 1]
        sorted_a = sorted(a, reverse=True)
        removed_count = sorted_a[:k].count(favorite_value)
        if removed_count >= 1 and sorted_a[k:].count(favorite_value) == 0:
            print('YES')
        elif removed_count == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('MAYBE')

func()
```

This corrected version checks if the favorite cube's value appears in the first `k` cubes and ensures that it does not appear after the first `k` cubes if it is to be always removed.
