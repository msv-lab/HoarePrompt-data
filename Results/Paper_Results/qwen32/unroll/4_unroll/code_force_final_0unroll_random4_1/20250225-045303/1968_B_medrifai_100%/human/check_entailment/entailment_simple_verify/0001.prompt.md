You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:

    i = 0
    j = 0
    c = 0
    while j < m and i < n:
        new_j = func_1(a, b, i, j)
        if new_j != -1:
            j = new_j + 1
            i += 1
            c += 1
        else:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:
Let's break down the program to understand whether it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the lengths of the binary strings `a` and `b`, followed by the strings themselves.

2. **Initialization:**
   - For each test case, two pointers `i` and `j` are initialized to 0. `i` will track the position in string `a`, and `j` will track the position in string `b`.
   - A counter `c` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n` (end of string `a` is not reached) and `j < m` (end of string `b` is not reached).
   - Inside the loop, it calls a helper function `func_1(a, b, i, j)` to find the index of the character `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]`.

4. **Helper Function `func_1`:**
   - This function returns the index of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in `b[j:]`.
   - If found, it returns the index adjusted to the original string `b` by adding `j`.
   - If not found, it returns `-1`.

5. **Updating Pointers and Counter:**
   - If `func_1` does not return `-1`, it means the character `a[i]` was found in `b[j:]`.
   - `j` is updated to `new_j + 1` (the position right after the found character in `b`), and `i` is incremented by 1 to move to the next character in `a`.
   - The counter `c` is incremented by 1 to reflect the fact that one more character from `a` has been matched as a subsequence in `b`.
   - If `func_1` returns `-1`, it means no more characters from `a` can be matched as a subsequence in `b`, and the loop breaks.

6. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the value of `c` is printed, which represents the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

### Verification Against Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

- **First Example:**
  - `a = "10011"`, `b = "1110"`
  - `1` is found at index `0` in `b`.
  - `0` is found at index `2` in `b`.
  - The prefix `"10"` of `a` is a subsequence of `b`, but `"100"` is not.
  - Output: `2`

- **Second Example:**
  - `a = "100"`, `b = "110"`
  - `1` is found at index `0` in `b`.
  - `0` is found at index `2` in `b`.
  - The prefix `"10"` of `a` is a subsequence of `b`.
  - Output: `2`

- **Third Example:**
  - `a = "1"`, `b = "111"`
  - `1` is found at index `0` in `b`.
  - The prefix `"1"` of `a` is a subsequence of `b`.
  - Output: `1`

- **Fourth Example:**
  - `a = "1011"`, `b = "1111"`
  - `1` is found at index `0` in `b`.
  - `0` is not found in `b`.
  - The prefix `"1"` of `a` is a subsequence of `b`.
  - Output: `1`

- **Fifth Example:**
  - `a = "100"`, `b = "11010"`
  - `1` is found at index `0` in `b`.
  - `0` is found at index `2` in `b`.
  - `0` is found at index `4` in `b`.
  - The prefix `"100"` of `a` is a subsequence of `b`.
  - Output: `3`

- **Sixth Example:**
  - `a = "100"`, `b = "0"`
  - `1` is not found in `b`.
  - The prefix `""` (empty string) of `a` is a subsequence of `b`.
  - Output: `0`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the maximum possible number `k` such that the prefix of `a` of length `k` is a subsequence of `b` for all given examples.
