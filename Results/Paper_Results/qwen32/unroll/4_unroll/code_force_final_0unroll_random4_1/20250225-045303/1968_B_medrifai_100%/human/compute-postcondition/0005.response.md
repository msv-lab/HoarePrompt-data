Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `a` and `b`, which are binary strings, and `i` and `j`, which are non-negative integers representing the current indices in strings `a` and `b`, respectively. The function returns the position of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]` plus the index `j`. If `a[i]` is not found in `b[j:]`, the function returns -1.**
