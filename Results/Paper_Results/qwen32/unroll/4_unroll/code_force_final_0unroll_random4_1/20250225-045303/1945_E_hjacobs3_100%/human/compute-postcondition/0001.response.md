Output State: **array is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to n, and find is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n) that needs to be found in the permutation; n is the length of the array; l is 0; r is n.**

In this output state, the variables `l` and `r` have been initialized to `0` and `n` respectively, while the initial state of `array` and `find` remains unchanged.
