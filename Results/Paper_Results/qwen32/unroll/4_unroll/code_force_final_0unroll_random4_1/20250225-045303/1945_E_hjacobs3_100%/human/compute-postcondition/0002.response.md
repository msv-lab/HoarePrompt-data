The `while` loop condition is `r - l > 1`. To ensure that the loop executes at least once, the condition must be true right before the loop starts. This means `r - l` must be greater than 1.

Given the initial states:
- `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
- `find` is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n) that needs to be found in the permutation.
- `n` is the length of the array.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n`.

Let's analyze the condition `r - l > 1`:
- Initially, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n`.
- For the loop to execute, `r - l > 1` must be true.
- This translates to `n - 0 > 1` or simply `n > 1`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1. If `n` is 1, the condition `n - 0 > 1` would be false, and the loop would not execute.

State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `find` is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n), `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n`**
