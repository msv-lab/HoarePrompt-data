The code calculates the integer square root of `n` plus one and assigns it to the variable `root`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `ans` remain unchanged. The new variable `root` is introduced with a specific value based on the input `n`.

Output State: **The function `func_1` does not take any direct input arguments. Instead, it is expected to read input from standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), which is the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6). It is guaranteed that the sum of `n` and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^6. `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input. `ans` is assigned the value of `n`. `root` is assigned the value of `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.**
