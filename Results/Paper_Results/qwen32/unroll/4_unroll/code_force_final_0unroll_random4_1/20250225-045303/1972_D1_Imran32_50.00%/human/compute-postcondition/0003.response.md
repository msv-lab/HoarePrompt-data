To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which in this case is `for i in range(2, root + 1):`. The loop will execute if the range `(2, root + 1)` contains at least one value, meaning `root` must be at least 2.

Here are the steps to determine the necessary adjustments:

1. **Determine the value of `root`**: Since `root` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, `root` needs to be at least 2 for the loop to execute. This implies that `int(math.sqrt(n))` must be at least 1, which means `n` must be at least 1. However, since the problem states `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6`, the smallest possible value for `n` is already 1, which makes `root` equal to 2.

2. **Adjust the state accordingly**: The state needs to ensure that `n` is at least 1, which will make `root` at least 2, allowing the loop to execute. The variable `i` is initialized in the loop, so we do not need to adjust its state before the loop starts. The variables `ans`, `t`, and `m` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted specifically for the loop to execute.

Given the above reasoning, the adjusted state should ensure that `n` is at least 1, which is already guaranteed by the problem constraints. However, to be explicit, we can state:

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^6), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6), `ans` is assigned the value of `n`, `root` is assigned the value of `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, and `root` is at least 2**.

Since the problem guarantees that `n` is at least 1, the key point is that `root` will be at least 2, allowing the loop to execute. Therefore, the state can be simplified to:

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^6), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6), `ans` is assigned the value of `n`, `root` is assigned the value of `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`**

This state ensures that the loop can execute because `root` will be at least 2.
