Output State: **t is an integer provided by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100; c_1, c_2, ..., c_n are integers such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100 for each i from 1 to n. The loop has printed "k - 1" t times, where k is the second integer in each of the t input pairs.**
