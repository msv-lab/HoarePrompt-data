### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program to see if it correctly solves the problem described.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of problems) and `m` (number of rounds).
   - It then reads a string `s` of length `n` representing the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Counting Problem Difficulties:**
   - It uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed:**
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the number of additional problems needed.
   - It iterates over each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
     - If a difficulty level is not present in the `Counter` (i.e., `i not in hmp`), it means Vlad does not have any problems of that difficulty level. Therefore, he needs to create `m` problems of that difficulty level, so `ans += m`.
     - If a difficulty level is present but the count is less than `m` (i.e., `hmp[i] < m`), it means Vlad needs to create enough additional problems to reach `m` for that difficulty level. Therefore, `ans += m - hmp[i]`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all the difficulty levels for a test case, it prints the total number of additional problems needed (`ans`).

### Verification with Examples:

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `10 1 BGECDCBDED`
   - Count of difficulties: `B: 3, G: 2, E: 2, C: 1, D: 2`
   - Missing difficulties: `A, F`
   - Additional problems needed: `2` (one 'A' and one 'F')
   - Output: `2`

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `10 2 BGECDCBDED`
   - Count of difficulties: `B: 3, G: 2, E: 2, C: 1, D: 2`
   - Missing difficulties: `A, F`
   - Additional problems needed for each missing: `2`
   - Additional problems needed for each existing but insufficient: `B: 1, G: 0, E: 0, C: 1, D: 0`
   - Total additional problems needed: `2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6 - 1 (already have one B) = 5`
   - Output: `5`

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `9 1 BBCDEFFGG`
   - Count of difficulties: `B: 2, C: 1, D: 1, E: 1, F: 2, G: 2`
   - Missing difficulties: `A`
   - Additional problems needed: `1`
   - Output: `1`

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case based on the provided examples.

### Conclusion:

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

**Correctness: True**
