Reasoning:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to come up with for each test case. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`. For each test case, it reads two integers, `n` and `m`, and a string `s` of length `n`.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: It uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Missing Problems**:
   - It iterates through each possible difficulty level ('A' to 'G').
   - If a difficulty level is not present in the `Counter` (i.e., not in the existing problems), it adds `m` to the answer because all `m` rounds need at least one problem of that level.
   - If a difficulty level is present but its count is less than `m`, it adds the difference `(m - count)` to the answer to ensure that there are at least `m` problems of that level.

4. **Output**: For each test case, the program prints the calculated answer, which is the minimum number of new problems needed.

The execution summary indicates that the function processes the input correctly and calculates the required number of problems for each test case, aligning with the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
