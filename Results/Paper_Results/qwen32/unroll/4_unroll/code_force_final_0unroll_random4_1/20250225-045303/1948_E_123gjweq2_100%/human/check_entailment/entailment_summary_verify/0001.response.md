### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the function summaries.

1. **Variable Scope Issue**:
   - The variables `arr` and `cliquess` are defined within the scope of `func_1` but are used in `make_array`. Since they are not passed as arguments or returned, this will indeed lead to a `NameError` in Python. This is a critical issue that prevents the code from running correctly.

2. **Clique Assignment and Edge Condition**:
   - The program attempts to divide vertices into roughly equal-sized groups and assigns them to cliques using the `make_array` function. However, this approach does not guarantee that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` holds for all pairs of vertices within each clique.
   - The function summary provided does not indicate any mechanism to ensure that the edge condition is satisfied. It only describes how values are assigned to `arr` and `cliquess`, without any checks or adjustments to ensure the graph properties are met.

3. **Output Validity**:
   - The output format is correct in terms of structure (three lines per test case), but the values in `arr` and `cliquess` do not guarantee that the graph can be partitioned into valid cliques according to the problem constraints.

4. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary for `make_array` is accurate in describing how values are assigned to `arr` and `cliquess`, but it does not address the crucial aspect of ensuring that the edge condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` holds.

### Conclusion:

Given the critical issue with variable scope and the lack of checks to ensure the edge condition is met, the program does not correctly solve the problem. The original assessment is accurate in identifying these issues.

**Final: False**
