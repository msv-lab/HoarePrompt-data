Let's analyze the provided code and determine if it correctly solves the problem as described. We need to ensure that the code assigns distinct integers to each vertex, creates edges based on the given condition, and partitions the graph into the minimum number of cliques.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes an array `arr` of size `n` with zeros, which will hold the assigned integers for each vertex.
   - It also initializes an array `cliquess` of size `n` with zeros, which will indicate the clique number for each vertex.
   - It calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.

2. **Assigning Integers and Creating Cliques**:
   - The function `func_1` calls `make_array` for each clique index `i` from `0` to `cliques - 1`.
   - The `make_array` function is supposed to assign integers to vertices in the range from `left` to `right` and mark them as belonging to the same clique `clique`.

3. **Assigning Values**:
   - Inside `make_array`, the function calculates the number of elements to assign in the first half (`mid`) and the second half (`not_mid`).
   - It assigns values in the range from `small_element` to `big_element` to the vertices in the specified range.
   - It also assigns the clique number to each vertex.

4. **Output**:
   - The function `func_1` prints the assigned integers, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments.

### Issues in the Code:

1. **Global Variables**:
   - The variables `arr` and `cliquess` are used in `make_array` but are not passed as arguments or returned. This means they are treated as global variables, which is not a good practice and can lead to errors if the function is used in a different context.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `mid` and `not_mid`**:
   - The calculation of `mid` and `not_mid` seems incorrect. The intention is to assign values symmetrically, but the current logic does not ensure that the values are distinct and correctly partitioned.

3. **Edge Condition**:
   - The condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is not directly checked in the code. The code assumes a specific way of assigning values to vertices, but it does not guarantee that the resulting graph will be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The output format seems correct, but the values assigned to vertices and the clique assignments need to be verified.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified, the code does not guarantee that the graph will be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques and that the edge condition will be satisfied. Therefore, the code is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
