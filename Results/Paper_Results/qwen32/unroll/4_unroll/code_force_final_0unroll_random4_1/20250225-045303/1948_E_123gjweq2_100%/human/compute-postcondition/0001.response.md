Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr); `clique` is an integer representing the clique number to which the vertices in the range [left, right] will be assigned; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `big_element` is updated to be `right + 1`. All other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, and `small_element`) remain unchanged.
