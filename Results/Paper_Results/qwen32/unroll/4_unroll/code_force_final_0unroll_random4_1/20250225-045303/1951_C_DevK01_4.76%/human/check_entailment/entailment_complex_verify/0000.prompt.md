You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

Additionally, there is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 representing the price per ticket for each of the n days. The total number of days n across all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

    #State: t is the same as the input integer; n, m, k, M, and N are reset for each iteration and do not persist.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `n` integers representing ticket prices. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum cost to buy up to `k` tickets, given that `m` is the total amount of money available per ticket purchase and tickets can be bought in batches of up to `m` tickets per day.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The main issue is that it incorrectly calculates the cost of buying tickets based on a greedy approach that does not account for the optimal way to distribute the ticket purchases over the days to minimize the total cost.

Here is a specific counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5 2 5
1 2 3 4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
12
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- Day 1: Buy 2 tickets at a cost of 1*2 = 2. Prices become [3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
- Day 2: Buy 2 tickets at a cost of 3*2 = 6. Prices become [5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
- Day 3: Buy 1 ticket at a cost of 5*1 = 5.

Total cost = 2 + 6 + 5 = 13.

However, the optimal way is:
- Day 1: Buy 1 ticket at a cost of 1*1 = 1. Prices become [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
- Day 2: Buy 1 ticket at a cost of 2*1 = 2. Prices become [3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
- Day 3: Buy 1 ticket at a cost of 3*1 = 3. Prices become [4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
- Day 4: Buy 1 ticket at a cost of 4*1 = 4. Prices become [5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
- Day 5: Buy 1 ticket at a cost of 5*1 = 5.

Total cost = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.

But the optimal way is actually:
- Day 1: Buy 2 tickets at a cost of 1*2 = 2. Prices become [3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
- Day 2: Buy 1 ticket at a cost of 3*1 = 3. Prices become [4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
- Day 3: Buy 1 ticket at a cost of 4*1 = 4. Prices become [5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
- Day 4: Buy 1 ticket at a cost of 5*1 = 5.

Total cost = 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14.

The program provided does not consider this optimal distribution of ticket purchases, and therefore it does not always yield the minimum cost. Hence, the program is incorrect.
