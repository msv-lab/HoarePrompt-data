Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The main issue lies in the approach to calculating the cost of purchasing tickets. The program attempts to sort the prices and then purchase tickets in a way that is not optimal according to the problem constraints.

Here are some key points that indicate the program's incorrectness:

1. **Sorting and Purchasing Strategy**: The program sorts the prices and then tries to purchase tickets in a way that does not account for the increasing prices due to previous purchases. This means that even if the cheapest tickets are bought first, the subsequent prices will increase, potentially making it more expensive to buy the remaining tickets.

2. **Handling of Remaining Tickets**: The program incorrectly calculates the cost for the last set of tickets. It does not properly account for the increased prices due to previous purchases.

3. **General Approach**: The program does not use a dynamic programming or greedy approach that would correctly handle the increasing prices due to previous purchases. Instead, it relies on a simplified calculation that does not consider the full impact of the purchase constraints.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using a priority queue (min-heap) to always buy the cheapest available tickets while keeping track of the increased prices due to previous purchases. This ensures that the total cost is minimized.
