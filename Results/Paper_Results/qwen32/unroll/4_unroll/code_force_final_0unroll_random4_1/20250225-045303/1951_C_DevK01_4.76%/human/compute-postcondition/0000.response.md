The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer `t` typically represents the number of test cases in a problem where multiple test cases need to be processed. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `a`) are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer; `n` is either 3 Â· 10^5, `m` is either 10^9, `k` is either min(nm, 10^9); `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9.**
