### Reasoning:

The problem states that Alice wants to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color by repainting at most `k` parts. Let's break down the logic used in the program.

1. **Single Part Case (`n == 1`)**:
   - If `n == 1`, Bob can trivially repaint the single part to any color, making it impossible for Alice to prevent this. Thus, the output should be 'NO'.

2. **Single Color Case (`m == 1`)**:
   - If `m == 1`, Alice has only one color to paint all parts, so Bob can trivially repaint at most `k` parts to make them all the same color. Thus, the output should be 'NO'.

3. **General Case**:
   - If `n > k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k`, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that no single color appears more than `k` times. This ensures that Bob cannot repaint at most `k` parts to make all parts the same color. Here, `math.ceil(n / m)` represents the maximum number of parts that can be painted with the same color to ensure that no color dominates in a way that Bob can make all parts the same color with `k` repainting operations.
   
   - If `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, Alice cannot prevent Bob from repainting the ribbon to make all parts the same color. Thus, the output should be 'NO'.

The logic in the program correctly handles these cases by checking if `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO', otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color with at most `k` repainting operations.

Correctness: **True**
