To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case and how it affects the output.

The loop iterates `t` times, where each iteration processes a test case with three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. The logic inside the loop checks if `n` is less than or equal to `k` or if `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

Since the loop does not modify any variables outside its scope and only prints results, the output state is simply a series of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, each corresponding to the result of a test case.

Given that the loop processes each test case independently and only prints results, the output state can be described as a sequence of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, one for each test case.

Output State: **A sequence of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, one for each test case, corresponding to the result of the condition checks inside the loop.**
