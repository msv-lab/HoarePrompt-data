Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 ≤ `m`, `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 50) representing the number of parts of the ribbon, the number of colors available, and the maximum number of parts Bob can repaint, respectively. `t` is assigned the value of the integer input.**

In simple terms, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the integer input, representing the number of test cases. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
