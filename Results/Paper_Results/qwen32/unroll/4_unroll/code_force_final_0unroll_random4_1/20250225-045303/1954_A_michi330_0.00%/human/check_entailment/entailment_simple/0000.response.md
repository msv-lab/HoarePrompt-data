### Reasoning:

To determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color, we need to analyze the constraints and the logic in the provided program.

1. **Single Part Case (n = 1):**
   - If there is only one part, Bob can always repaint it regardless of the number of colors. Therefore, Alice cannot prevent Bob from making all parts the same color. The condition `n <= k` correctly handles this case by printing 'NO'.

2. **One Color Case (m = 1):**
   - If there is only one color, Alice has no choice but to paint all parts with that color. Bob can then repaint at most `k` parts, which will still result in all parts being the same color. Therefore, the condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` correctly handles this case by printing 'NO'. When `m = 1`, `math.ceil(n / m)` equals `n`, making `n - n` equal to `0`, which is less than any `k > 0`.

3. **General Case (n > 1 and m > 1):**
   - Alice can use multiple colors to paint the ribbon. The goal is to ensure that Bob cannot repaint at most `k` parts to make all parts the same color.
   - The key insight is that if Alice can distribute the colors such that no single color appears more than `n - k` times, Bob will not be able to repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.
   - The expression `math.ceil(n / m)` calculates the minimum number of parts that will have the most frequent color if the colors are distributed as evenly as possible.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it means that the most frequent color appears more than `n - k` times, allowing Bob to repaint `k` parts to make all parts the same color. Therefore, the program correctly prints 'NO' in this case.
   - Otherwise, the program prints 'YES', indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

**Correctness: True**
