Let's carefully analyze the problem, the provided program code, and the function summary to ensure the correctness of the program. 

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color by repainting at most `k` parts. Here are the key points:

1. **Bob's Capability**: Bob can repaint up to `k` parts. If Alice paints the ribbon such that no single color appears more than `n - k` times, Bob cannot make all parts the same color by repainting at most `k` parts.
2. **Alice's Strategy**: Alice needs to avoid painting the ribbon in such a way that any single color appears more than `n - k` times. This means she should aim for a distribution of colors where no color is used more than `n - k` times.
3. **Balanced Distribution**: The most balanced distribution of colors among `n` parts using `m` colors is such that each color is used as evenly as possible. The maximum number of parts that can be painted with the same color without violating the condition is `math.ceil(n / m)`.

### Program Analysis
The provided program checks the following conditions:
1. **Condition 1**: `n <= k`
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color, so Alice cannot prevent this. The program correctly prints 'NO' in this case.
2. **Condition 2**: `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it means that even with the most balanced distribution of colors, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color. The program correctly prints 'NO' in this case.
3. **Otherwise**: If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints 'YES', meaning Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

### Evaluation
Let's verify the logic with some examples:
- **Example 1**: `n = 1`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`
  - `n <= k` is true, so the program prints 'NO'. This is correct because Bob can repaint the single part.
- **Example 2**: `n = 5`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`
  - `n <= k` is false, but `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 5 = 0 < 1` is true, so the program prints 'NO'. This is correct because Bob can repaint one part to match the others.
- **Example 3**: `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 1`
  - `n <= k` is false, and `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2 >= 1`, so the program prints 'YES'. This is correct because Alice can paint the ribbon as `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, preventing Bob from making all parts the same color.
- **Example 4**: `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 2`
  - `n <= k` is false, and `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2 < 2` is false, but `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is true, so the program prints 'NO'. This is correct because Bob can repaint two parts to match the others.
- **Example 5**: `n = 5`, `m = 5`, `k = 3`
  - `n <= k` is false, and `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 1 = 4 >= 3`, so the program prints 'YES'. This is correct because Alice can paint the ribbon as `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, preventing Bob from making all parts the same color.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that prevents Bob from making all parts the same color. The conditions checked in the program accurately reflect the necessary and sufficient conditions derived from the problem statement.

**Final: True**
