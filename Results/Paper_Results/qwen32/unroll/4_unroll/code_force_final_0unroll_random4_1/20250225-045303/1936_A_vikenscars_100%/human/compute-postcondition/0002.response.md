To determine the output state after the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and the function `func_1`. The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. In each iteration, it calls `func_1` with the current `max_item_idx`, the same `max_item_idx`, and `i` twice. The result of `func_1` is compared with `<`. If the result is `<`, `max_item_idx` is updated to `i`.

However, the specific behavior of `func_1` is not provided in the problem statement. For the sake of this explanation, let's assume that `func_1(a, b, c, d)` returns `<` if `c` is less than `d` and `a` and `b` do not affect the comparison. This is a common interpretation for such problems when the function's behavior is not specified.

Given this assumption, the loop will update `max_item_idx` to the largest `i` for which `func_1` returns `<`. Since `func_1` returns `<` if `i` is greater than `max_item_idx` (initially 0), `max_item_idx` will be updated in each iteration until the end of the loop. Therefore, after the loop completes, `max_item_idx` will be `n-1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation sequence, where 2 <= n <= 10^4; `max_item_idx` is n-1**.
