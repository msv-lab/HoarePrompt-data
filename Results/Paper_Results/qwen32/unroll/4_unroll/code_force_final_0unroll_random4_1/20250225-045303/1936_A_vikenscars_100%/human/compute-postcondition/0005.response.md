To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, let's analyze the given code:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation sequence.
   - `max_item_idx` is initialized to `n-1`.
   - `pair_idx` is also initialized to `n-1`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs `n` times, with `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.
   - In each iteration:
     - `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`.
     - If `ans1` is `<`, then `pair_idx` is set to `i`.
     - If `ans1` is `=`, then `ans2` is the result of `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`.
       - If `ans2` is `>`, then `pair_idx` is set to `i`.

3. **Interpretation:**
   - The function `func_1` seems to be comparing elements in some way, but its exact behavior is not provided. However, we can infer the following:
     - If `ans1` is `<`, it suggests that the element at `max_item_idx` is less than the element at `i`, and thus `pair_idx` is updated to `i`.
     - If `ans1` is `=`, it suggests that the element at `max_item_idx` is equal to the element at `i`, and then another comparison is made between the elements at `pair_idx` and `i`. If `ans2` is `>`, it implies that the element at `pair_idx` is greater than the element at `i`, and `pair_idx` is updated to `i`.

4. **Final State:**
   - The loop iterates through all elements from `0` to `n-1`.
   - The `pair_idx` will be updated based on the conditions inside the loop.
   - The final value of `pair_idx` will be the index of the element that meets the conditions described above.

Given the nature of the loop and the provided logic, the final `pair_idx` is likely to be the index of the smallest element in the permutation sequence, as the loop seems to be searching for the smallest element by comparing elements and updating `pair_idx` accordingly.

Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation sequence, where 2 <= n <= 10^4; max_item_idx is n-1; pair_idx is the index of the smallest element in the permutation sequence.**
