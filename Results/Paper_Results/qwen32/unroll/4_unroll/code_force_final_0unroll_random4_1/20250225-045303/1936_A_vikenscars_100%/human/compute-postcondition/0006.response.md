To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and understand the values of the variables `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **n**: A positive integer representing the length of the permutation sequence, where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\).
2. **max_item_idx**: This is defined as \(n-1\).
3. **pair_idx**: This is the index of the smallest element in the permutation sequence.

### Analysis:
- **max_item_idx**: Given that `max_item_idx` is defined as \(n-1\), we can directly state that this value will always be \(n-1\).
- **pair_idx**: This is the index of the smallest element in the permutation sequence. Since we don't have the specific permutation sequence, we can only describe `pair_idx` as the index of the smallest element in the permutation sequence.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output a formatted string with the values of `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`.

Given the above analysis, the output will be:
Output: **! [n-1] [pair_idx] (where [n-1] is n-1 and [pair_idx] is the index of the smallest element in the permutation sequence)**
