Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The definition of a beautiful array is that you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element with its neighbors if they are the same.

The provided program attempts to solve this problem by iterating through the array and counting the lengths of contiguous segments of the same number. It then keeps track of the smallest segment length encountered. The idea is that removing all elements of the smallest segment will result in an array that is no longer beautiful.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It initializes `same` to 1 to count the length of the current segment of the same number and `num` to the first element of the array.
   - It initializes `minn` to infinity to keep track of the smallest segment length.
   - It iterates through the array using a while loop:
     - If the current element is the same as `num`, it increments `same`.
     - If the current element is different from `num`, it updates `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to the current element.
     - It increments `i` to move to the next element.
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time with the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
   - It checks if `minn` is still infinity or equal to the length of the array. If so, it prints -1, indicating that the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing any elements.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`, the size of the smallest segment.

The logic of the program is correct in theory: removing all elements of the smallest contiguous segment of the same number will indeed make the array non-beautiful, as it breaks the property that allows the array to be made uniform through the given operation.

However, the program has a small issue with the loop increment. The line `i += 1` is present both inside the `if` block and outside it, causing the loop to skip elements when `ar[i]` is different from `num`. This results in incorrect segment lengths being calculated.

To fix the program, the line `i += 1` should be moved outside the `if` block, ensuring that `i` is incremented only once per iteration of the loop.

Given the current implementation, the program will not always produce the correct output due to this error.

Correctness: **False**
