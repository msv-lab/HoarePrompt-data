The loop in the given code is controlled by the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute as many times as the integer value read from the input, which corresponds to the number of test cases `t`. 

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to adjust the state such that `int(input())` returns a value greater than 0. Since `t` is defined as an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, we need to make sure that `t` is at least 1.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the integer read from the input.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be at least 1.
3. The state before the loop should ensure that `int(input())` returns a value of at least 1.

Given these points, the state before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1. The other variables `n` and `a` are part of the loop body and do not need to be adjusted in the state before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
