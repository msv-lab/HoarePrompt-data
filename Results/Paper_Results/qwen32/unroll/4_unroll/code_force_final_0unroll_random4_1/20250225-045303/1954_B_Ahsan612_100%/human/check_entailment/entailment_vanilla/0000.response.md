Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a[i]` with `a[i-1]` if `a[i-1] == a[i+1]`.

### Key Points:
1. **Beautiful Array**: An array is beautiful if you can make all elements the same by the given operation.
2. **Operation**: You can choose an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) such that `a[i-1] = a[i+1]` and replace `a[i]` with `a[i-1]`.
3. **Objective**: Find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array no longer beautiful. If it's impossible, return -1.

### Program Analysis:
The given program aims to solve the problem by following these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
3. It then iterates through the array to find the smallest group of consecutive identical elements.
4. If the smallest group size is the entire array or if no such group is found, it outputs -1.
5. Otherwise, it outputs the size of the smallest group.

### Detailed Reasoning:
1. **Identifying Consecutive Groups**:
   - The program correctly identifies groups of consecutive identical elements by iterating through the array.
   - It keeps track of the size of each group and updates the minimum size found.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If the array consists of only one element, it is trivially beautiful, and removing any element (which is none) will not make it less beautiful, so it correctly returns -1.
   - If the entire array is a single group of identical elements, it correctly returns -1 because removing any number of elements will not make it non-beautiful.

3. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The core idea is to find the smallest group of consecutive identical elements because removing all but one element from this group will make the array non-beautiful.
   - This approach is sound because removing elements from any other group will not necessarily make the array non-beautiful, but removing from the smallest group will.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful or returns -1 if it's impossible.

**Correctness: True**
