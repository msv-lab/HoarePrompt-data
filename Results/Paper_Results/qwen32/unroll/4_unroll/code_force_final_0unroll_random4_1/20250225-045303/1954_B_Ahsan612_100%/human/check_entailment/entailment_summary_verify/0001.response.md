### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment to determine whether the program is correct or not.

#### Program Analysis:

The program aims to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. It does this by identifying the smallest segment of consecutive identical elements and removing all elements in that segment.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the code:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `same` is initialized to 1, representing the length of the current segment of identical elements.
   - `num` is initialized to the first element of the array.
   - `minn` is initialized to `inf` to find the smallest segment length.

2. **Loop through the array:**
   - The loop iterates through the array using a while loop.
   - If the current element (`ar[i]`) is the same as `num`, `same` is incremented.
   - If the current element is different from `num`, it updates `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to the current element.
   - The increment `i += 1` is present both inside and outside the `if` block, causing the loop to skip elements when `ar[i]` is different from `num`.

3. **Final update:**
   - After the loop, `minn` is updated one last time with the minimum of `minn` and `same`.

4. **Output:**
   - If `minn` is still `inf` or equal to the length of the array, it prints `-1`, indicating that the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing any elements.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`, the size of the smallest segment.

#### Original Assessment:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program has an issue with the loop increment. Specifically, the line `i += 1` inside the `if` block causes the loop to skip elements when `ar[i]` is different from `num`, leading to incorrect segment lengths.

#### Verification:

To verify the correctness of the program, we need to ensure that the segment lengths are calculated accurately. The issue with the loop increment should be fixed to ensure that `i` is incremented only once per iteration of the loop.

Here's the corrected version of the loop:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = float('inf')
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
                num = ar[i]
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        if minn == float('inf') or minn == len(ar):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
```

In the corrected version, the line `i += 1` is moved outside the `if` block, ensuring that `i` is incremented only once per iteration of the loop. This corrects the calculation of segment lengths.

#### Conclusion:

Given the original program has a critical error with the loop increment, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate. The corrected version of the program should be used to ensure the correct output.

**Final: False**
