You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly when it comes to efficiently placing the 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Calculation of Remaining Cells**:
   - The code calculates `remaining_cells` after placing the 2x2 icons as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. This calculation is correct in the sense that it determines how many 1x1 cells are left after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - However, the code does not account for the fact that the remaining cells might not form a complete 5x3 grid. For example, if you place a 2x2 icon in the top-left corner, you will have 11 cells left, but these cells are not necessarily contiguous and can be spread across multiple screens.

2. **Handling of Extra Space**:
   - The code calculates `extra_space` as `space_x - remaining_cells`. This is correct in the sense that it determines how many additional 1x1 cells need to be placed after the remaining cells from the 2x2 icons are filled.
   - However, the calculation of `extra_screen` is incorrect. The code checks if `space_x % 15 == 0` and then calculates `extra_screen` as `space_x // 15` or `extra_space // 15 + 1`. This is incorrect because it does not consider the remaining cells that could be used on the last screen with 2x2 icons.

3. **Example of Incorrectness**:
   - Consider the input `x = 11` and `y = 2`. The code will first place the 2x2 icons, which will occupy 8 cells and leave 7 cells on the first screen. The remaining 4 cells will be on the second screen. The remaining 11 cells need to be placed, but the code will incorrectly calculate the number of additional screens needed.
   - The correct approach would be to place the 2x2 icons first and then place the 1x1 icons in the remaining cells, considering the layout of the grid.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        screens = 0
        
        # Place 2x2 icons first
        screens += y // 2
        if y % 2 == 1:
            screens += 1
            x -= 3  # Place one 2x2 icon and 3 1x1 icons on the same screen
        
        # Place remaining 1x1 icons
        while x > 0:
            if x >= 15:
                screens += 1
                x -= 15
            elif x >= 11:
                screens += 1
                x -= 11
            elif x >= 7:
                screens += 1
                x -= 7
            elif x >= 3:
                screens += 1
                x -= 3
            elif x >= 1:
                screens += 1
                x -= 1
        
        result.append(screens)
    
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the 1x1 icons are placed efficiently after the 2x2 icons, considering the layout of the grid.
