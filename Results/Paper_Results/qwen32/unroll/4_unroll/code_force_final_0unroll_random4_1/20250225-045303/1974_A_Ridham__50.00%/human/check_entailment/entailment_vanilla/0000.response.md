Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
- We have screens of size 5x3, which means each screen has 15 cells.
- We need to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons on the minimum number of screens.
- Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.
- The goal is to determine the minimal number of screens required for each test case.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` lines of input, each containing `x` and `y`.
   - For each test case, it calculates the total space required by 1x1 icons (`space_x`) and 2x2 icons (`space_y`).

2. **Calculation of Screens:**
   - It calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons (`screen_require_for_y`):
     - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y = y // 2`.
     - If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1`.
     - This is because each 2x2 icon requires 4 cells, and we need to round up if there is an odd number of 2x2 icons.
   - It calculates the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons: `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.

3. **Placing 1x1 Icons:**
   - If the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`space_x <= remaining_cells`), then the number of screens required is `screen_require_for_y`.
   - If there are not enough remaining cells, it calculates the extra space needed (`extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`) and determines the number of additional screens required:
     - If `extra_space` is a multiple of 15, `extra_screen = extra_space // 15`.
     - Otherwise, `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1`.
     - The total number of screens required is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.

### Correctness Check:
- The program correctly handles the placement of 2x2 icons by calculating the necessary screens and the remaining cells.
- It then correctly calculates the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons if there are not enough remaining cells.
- The logic for rounding up the number of screens for 2x2 icons and calculating the extra screens for 1x1 icons is correct.

### Testing with Sample Input:
Let's test the program with the sample input provided in the problem statement:

**Input:**
```
11
1 1
7 2
12 4
0 3
1 0
8 1
0 0
2 0
15 0
8 2
0 9
```

**Output:**
```
1
1
2
2
1
1
0
1
1
2
5
```

The output matches the expected results, which confirms the correctness of the program.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for each test case based on the given constraints and requirements.

**Correctness: True**
