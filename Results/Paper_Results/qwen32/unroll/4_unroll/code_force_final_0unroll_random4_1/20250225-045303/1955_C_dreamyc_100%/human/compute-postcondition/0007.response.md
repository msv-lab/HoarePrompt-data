The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `t`, `k`, `nums`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `s_a`, and `s_b` are given, but they do not directly affect whether the loop will execute. The loop's execution solely depends on `n` being greater than 0 and `i` being initialized to 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15; `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`; `b` is `k // 2`; `ans` is 0; `s_a` is 0; `s_b` is 0; `i` is 0; `n` must be greater than 0**
