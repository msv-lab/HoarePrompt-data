Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the number of ships that would be sunk after the Kraken's attacks. However, the logic in the function `func_1` is incorrect.

The function `func_1` calculates `a` and `b` as the number of attacks on the first and last ships respectively, and then it tries to determine how many ships would be sunk by summing up their durability until the sum exceeds `a` or `b`. This approach is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the alternating attacks on the first and last ships.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the issues:

1. The variables `a` and `b` are calculated as `math.ceil(k / 2)` and `k // 2` respectively. This is incorrect because it assumes that the number of attacks on the first and last ships are exactly half of `k`, but in reality, the number of attacks on the first and last ships could be different if `k` is odd.
2. The logic of incrementing `ans` based on the cumulative sum of the first and last ship's durability is flawed. It does not correctly simulate the alternating attacks and the sinking of ships.
3. The function does not correctly simulate the removal of ships from the list once they sink, which affects the subsequent attacks.

A correct approach would involve simulating the attacks while keeping track of the ships that have sunk. Since `k` can be very large, a more efficient approach would be to use a priority queue or a similar data structure to keep track of the ships with the lowest durability and simulate the attacks until all ships are sunk or the number of attacks reaches `k`.

Given the issues in the provided code, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
