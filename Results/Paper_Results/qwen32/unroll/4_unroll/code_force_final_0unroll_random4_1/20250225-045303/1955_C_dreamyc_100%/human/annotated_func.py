#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15. nums is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (the number of integers in the list `nums`), `k` (an integer), and `nums` (a list of `n` integers). It returns the integer `n` if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in `nums`. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the count of iterations where the cumulative sum from the start or the end of the list `nums` is less than or equal to `k // 2` and `math.ceil(k / 2)` respectively.
