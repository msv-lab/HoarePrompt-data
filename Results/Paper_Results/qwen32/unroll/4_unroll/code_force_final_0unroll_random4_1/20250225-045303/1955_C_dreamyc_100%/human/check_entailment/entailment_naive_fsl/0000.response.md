Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attack pattern as described in the problem statement. It attempts to calculate the number of ships sunk by summing the durability from the front and back separately and comparing it to half of the total attacks. However, this approach does not accurately reflect the alternating attack pattern (first, last, first, last, etc.).

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
1
5 7
1 2 3 4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
1. Kraken attacks the first ship (durability becomes 0), a = [2, 3, 4, 5]
2. Kraken attacks the last ship (durability becomes 4), a = [2, 3, 4]
3. Kraken attacks the first ship (durability becomes 1), a = [3, 4]
4. Kraken attacks the last ship (durability becomes 3), a = [3]
5. Kraken attacks the first ship (durability becomes 2), a = []
6. Kraken attacks the last ship (no ships left, does nothing)
7. Kraken attacks the first ship (no ships left, does nothing)

So, 3 ships were sunk.

**Actual Output from the Program:**
The program will not produce the correct output for this test case because it does not simulate the alternating attack pattern accurately. The logic in `func_1` is flawed as it does not correctly account for the alternating nature of the attacks and the fact that ships are removed from the list as they sink.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
