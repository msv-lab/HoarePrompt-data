Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

The problem requires the following steps:
1. Read the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case, read two integers, `x` and `y`.
3. Output the minimum of `x` and `y`, followed by the maximum of `x` and `y`.

Now, let's analyze the provided code:

```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
```

The code does the following:
1. It reads the number of test cases and stores it in `x`.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers and stores them in `x` and `y`.
3. It checks if `x` is greater than `y`. If true, it prints `x` followed by `y`. If false, it prints `y` followed by `x`.

However, there is a logical error in the code. The condition `if x > y` is incorrect because it prints `x` first when `x` is greater than `y`, which is the opposite of what is required. The correct condition should be `if x > y` to print `y` first, followed by `x`, and `else` to print `x` followed by `y`.

The correct condition should be:
```python
if x > y:
    print(y, x)
else:
    print(x, y)
```

Thus, the provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly output the minimum and maximum values in the required order.

Correctness: **False**
