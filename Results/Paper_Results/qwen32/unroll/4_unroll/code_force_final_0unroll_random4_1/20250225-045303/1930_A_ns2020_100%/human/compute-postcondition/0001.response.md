The `while` loop in the provided code snippet is:

```python
while t:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute as long as `t` is a non-zero value. Given that `t` is assigned the value `int(input())` and the precondition for `t` is \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), this means that `t` will always be a positive integer within the specified range, and thus, the loop will always execute at least once.

Since `t` is guaranteed to be a positive integer (and therefore truthy in a boolean context), no adjustments are needed to ensure the first iteration of the loop can proceed. The state right before the loop is already sufficient to ensure that the loop will execute.

State: **`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The precondition for `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) is still valid. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the list `a` contains 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7.**
