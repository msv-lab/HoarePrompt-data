For the given task, we need to ensure that the `while` loop can execute at least once. The loop condition is `while n:`, which means the loop will execute as long as `n` is a non-zero value.

Given:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is calculated and printed based on a formula, but it does not affect the loop condition directly.
- The initial state of the coordinates of the squares is not affected by this code.

To ensure the first iteration of the loop can proceed, `n` must be a non-zero value. Since `n` is an input integer, we need to adjust the state such that `n` is explicitly set to a non-zero value.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`n` must be a non-zero integer**

This ensures that the `while n:` loop will execute at least once.
