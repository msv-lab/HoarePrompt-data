The code snippet assigns the value of `L[-1] - 2` to the variable `nums_left`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment.

Given the initial state, `L[-1]` is equal to `R[0]`, which is `N`. Therefore, `nums_left` becomes `N - 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N`, `M1`, `M2` are integers read from the input; for each test case, `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2` are integers such that 1 <= m_1, m_2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}` and `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}` are integers such that 1 <= p_i <= n and p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_{m_1}, and 1 <= s_i <= n and s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_{m_2}. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `R` is a list of integers read from the input; `L[-1]` is equal to `R[0]`; `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is `N`. At least one of the following is true: `M1` is not greater than 1, `M2` is not greater than 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`. `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1`. `cur` is `M1 - 2`. Additionally, `M1` is greater than 1; `nums_left` is `N - 2`.**
