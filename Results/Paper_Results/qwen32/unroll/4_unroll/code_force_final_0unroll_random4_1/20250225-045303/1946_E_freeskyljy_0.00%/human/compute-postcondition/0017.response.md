The `while` loop in the provided code is:

```python
while i > 1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will execute as long as the variable `i` is greater than 1. Given the state right before the loop:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `N`, `M1`, `M2` are integers read from the input.
- For each test case, `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2` are integers such that 1 <= m_1, m_2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
- `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}` and `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}` are integers such that 1 <= p_i <= n and p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_{m_1}, and 1 <= s_i <= n and s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_{m_2}.
- The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
- `L` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `R` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `L[-1]` is equal to `R[0]`.
- `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is `N`.
- At least one of the following is true: `M1` is not greater than 1, `M2` is not greater than 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`.
- `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1`.
- `cur` is `M1 - 2`.
- `M1` is greater than 1.
- `nums_left` is `N - 2`.
- `i` is `N - 1`.

The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is greater than 1. Right before the loop, `i` is `N - 1`. Since `N` is at least 2 (because `M1` is greater than 1 and `nums_left` is `N - 2`, which must be a non-negative integer), `i` will indeed be greater than 1.

Therefore, no adjustment to the state is necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N`, `M1`, `M2` are integers read from the input; for each test case, `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2` are integers such that 1 <= m_1, m_2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}` and `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}` are integers such that 1 <= p_i <= n and p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_{m_1}, and 1 <= s_i <= n and s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_{m_2}. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `R` is a list of integers read from the input; `L[-1]` is equal to `R[0]`; `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is `N`. At least one of the following is true: `M1` is not greater than 1, `M2` is not greater than 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`. `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1`. `cur` is `M1 - 2`. `M1` is greater than 1; `nums_left` is `N - 2`; `i` is `N - 1`**
