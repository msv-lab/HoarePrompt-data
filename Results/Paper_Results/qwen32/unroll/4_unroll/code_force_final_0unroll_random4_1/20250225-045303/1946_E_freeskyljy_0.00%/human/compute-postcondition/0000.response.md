The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `N`, `M1`, and `M2`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2` are integers with specific constraints. The variables `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}` and `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}` are also defined with constraints, but they are not affected by this code snippet.

After executing the code snippet, the values of `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are set to the integers read from the input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N`, `M1`, `M2` are integers read from the input; for each test case, `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2` are integers such that 1 <= m_1, m_2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}` and `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}` are integers such that 1 <= p_i <= n and p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_{m_1}, and 1 <= s_i <= n and s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_{m_2}. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
