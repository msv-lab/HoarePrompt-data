You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        flag = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of binary strings, each representing a test case, and outputs the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in each string. If the string is non-decreasing (i.e., it does not have a '0' followed by a '1'), it adds one to the count of transitions before outputting the result.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires determining the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) that a binary string must be cut into, such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

### Key Observations:
1. If the string is already sorted, the answer is 1, as no cuts are needed.
2. If the string is not sorted, the number of cuts needed corresponds to the number of transitions from '1' to '0' plus one. This is because each such transition indicates a boundary where the string needs to be cut to allow rearrangement into a sorted order.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case as follows:
1. It initializes `count` to 0, which will keep track of the number of transitions from '1' to '0'.
2. It initializes `flag` to 0, which will be used to check if there is at least one '0' after a '1'.
3. It iterates through the string, comparing each character with the next one.
   - If the current character is different from the next character, it increments `count`.
   - If the current character is '1' and the next character is '0', it sets `flag` to 1.
4. After the loop, if `flag` is 0 (indicating the string is sorted), it prints `count + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `count`.

### Correctness Verification:
- The program correctly counts the number of transitions from '1' to '0' using `count`.
- The `flag` is used to check if there is at least one '0' after a '1'. However, this check is unnecessary because:
  - If `count` is 0, the string is already sorted, and `count + 1` correctly returns 1.
  - If `count` is greater than 0, the string is not sorted, and `count` correctly represents the number of cuts needed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string. The `flag` variable is redundant but does not affect the correctness of the program.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
