Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not properly implement the logic to determine if it is possible to change the radii of the disks according to the problem's requirements. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the calculation of new radii that would ensure the sum of all radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency and non-overlapping conditions.

The main issues in the code are:
1. The `dfs` function is not defined within the scope of `func_1`, leading to a `NameError`.
2. The `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` variables are not accessible within the `dfs` function.
3. The logic to determine if a valid change in radii is possible is flawed. The current implementation uses a depth-first search to explore connected components of tangent disks but does not correctly calculate or check the feasibility of the new radii.

To fix the program, you would need to:
- Ensure that the `dfs` function is properly defined and has access to the necessary variables.
- Implement logic to calculate new radii that maintain tangency and non-overlapping conditions while strictly decreasing the sum of the radii.
- Check if such a configuration is possible and print "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the program that implements the required logic:

```python
def can_decrease_radii(n, disks):
    from collections import defaultdict

    # Build the graph of tangent disks
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            dx = disks[i][0] - disks[j][0]
            dy = disks[i][1] - disks[j][1]
            if (disks[i][2] + disks[j][2]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
                graph[i].append(j)
                graph[j].append(i)

    # Check if we can assign new radii
    def dfs(node, parent, radius_sum, radius_count):
        nonlocal possible
        if possible is False:
            return
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor == parent:
                continue
            if visited[neighbor]:
                if abs(radius_sum - radii[neighbor]) != radii[node] + radii[neighbor]:
                    possible = False
                    return
            else:
                visited[neighbor] = True
                radii[neighbor] = radii[node] + radii[neighbor] - abs(radius_sum - radii[neighbor])
                dfs(neighbor, node, radius_sum - radii[neighbor], radius_count + 1)

    visited = [False] * n
    radii = [disk[2] for disk in disks]
    possible = True

    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            visited[i] = True
            dfs(i, -1, radii[i], 1)
            if not possible:
                break

    # Check if we can strictly decrease the sum of radii
    if possible:
        new_radii_sum = sum(radii) - n
        if new_radii_sum < sum(disk[2] for disk in disks):
            return "YES"
    return "NO"

# Read input
n = int(input())
disks = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Output the result
print(can_decrease_radii(n, disks))
```

This corrected version constructs a graph of tangent disks, performs a depth-first search to check the feasibility of new radii, and verifies if the sum of the new radii is strictly less than the original sum.
