### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective**: Determine if the radii of disks can be changed such that:
  - Disks that are tangent remain tangent.
  - No two disks overlap.
  - The sum of all radii strictly decreases.
- **Constraints**: 
  - Centers of disks remain fixed.
  - New radii can be arbitrary positive real numbers.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Global Variables**: 
   - The `dfs` function uses global variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes`. This is generally not a good practice but is acceptable in this context as the function is not intended to be reused outside of `func_1`.

2. **DFS Logic**:
   - The DFS is used to explore connected components of disks that are tangent to each other.
   - The condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` correctly identifies tangent disks.
   - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to track the sum of radii in a way that helps determine if the sum can be decreased.

3. **Coefficient Calculation**:
   - `coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`
   - `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]`
   - This logic is intended to ensure that the sum of radii can be adjusted while maintaining tangency.

4. **Output Logic**:
   - The program prints "YES" if `c1 != 0` for any connected component of disks.
   - This is based on the assumption that a non-zero `c1` indicates that the sum of radii can be adjusted in a way that strictly decreases the total sum while maintaining tangency.

#### Evaluation Using Annotations:
- **State Before DFS**:
  - `n` is the number of disks.
  - `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of coordinates and radii.
  - `visited` is initialized to `False`.
  - `coef0` and `coef1` are initialized to `None`.
  - `nodes` is an empty list.

- **State After DFS**:
  - `visited` is updated to `True` for all disks in the connected component.
  - `coef0` and `coef1` are updated with specific values.
  - `nodes` contains the indices of disks in the connected component.
  - `c0` and `c1` are sums of `coef0` and `coef1` respectively.

- **Output Decision**:
  - `ok` is set to `True` if any connected component has a non-zero `c1`.
  - The program prints "YES" if `ok` is `True`, otherwise "NO".

#### Counterexample Analysis:
The provided counterexample:
```
4
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
3 0 1
```
- **Explanation**: The disks are in a line and tangent to each other. The sum of radii is 4. To strictly decrease the sum while maintaining tangency, the radii would need to be adjusted such that the new sum is less than 4 and tangency is preserved. However, since all disks are tangent and have the same radius, any adjustment that maintains tangency would not strictly decrease the sum.

- **Program Output**: The program outputs "YES" because `c1` is non-zero for the connected component. This is incorrect because the sum of radii cannot be strictly decreased while maintaining tangency.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program's logic for determining if the sum of radii can be strictly decreased while maintaining tangency is flawed. The provided counterexample demonstrates a case where the program incorrectly outputs "YES".

### Final: **False**
