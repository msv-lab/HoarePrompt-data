You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, x, y, and r are lists of length n, where each element of x and y is an integer such that -10^9 <= x_i, y_i <= 10^9, and each element of r is an integer such that 1 <= r_i <= 10^9. visited, coef0, and coef1 are lists of length n initialized with None. nodes is an initially empty list.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef0 = [None] * n
    coef1 = [None] * n
    nodes = []
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `x` is a list of length `n` with elements as integers from the input; `y` is a list of length `n` with elements as integers from the input; `r` is a list of length `n` with elements as integers from the input; `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements as `False`; `coef0` is a list of length `n` with all elements as `None`; `coef1` is a list of length `n` with all elements as `None`; `nodes` is an empty list.
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef0[i] = 0
            coef1[i] = 1
            nodes = []
            dfs(i)
            c0 = 0
            c1 = 0
            for j in nodes:
                c0 += coef0[j]
                c1 += coef1[j]
            ok = ok or c1 != 0
        
    #State: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `x` is a list of length `n` with elements as integers from the input; `y` is a list of length `n` with elements as integers from the input; `r` is a list of length `n` with elements as integers from the input; `visited` is a list of length `n` with elements as `True` for all indices that were part of any DFS traversal; `coef0` is a list of length `n` with elements as integers assigned based on DFS traversal; `coef1` is a list of length `n` with elements as integers assigned based on DFS traversal; `nodes` is an empty list; `ok` is `True` if any DFS traversal resulted in a non-zero `c1`.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 1000; `x` is a list of length `n` with elements as integers from the input; `y` is a list of length `n` with elements as integers from the input; `r` is a list of length `n` with elements as integers from the input; `visited` is a list of length `n` with elements as `True` for all indices that were part of any DFS traversal; `coef0` is a list of length `n` with elements as integers assigned based on DFS traversal; `coef1` is a list of length `n` with elements as integers assigned based on DFS traversal; `nodes` is an empty list; `ok` is `True` if at least one DFS traversal resulted in a non-zero `c1`, otherwise `ok` is `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. It processes three lists `x`, `y`, and `r`, each of length `n` (where `1 <= n <= 1000`), with `x` and `y` containing integers within the range `-10^9` to `10^9`, and `r` containing integers within the range `1` to `10^9`. Additionally, it uses three lists `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1`, each of length `n` and initially set to `None`. It also uses a list `nodes` that is initially empty. The function returns the list `nodes` after processing the input lists.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
