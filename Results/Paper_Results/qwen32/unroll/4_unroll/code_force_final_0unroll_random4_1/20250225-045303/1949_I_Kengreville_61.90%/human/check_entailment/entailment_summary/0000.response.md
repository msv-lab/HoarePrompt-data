### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it is possible to adjust the radii of disks such that:

1. Disks that were tangent remain tangent.
2. No two disks overlap.
3. The total sum of the radii strictly decreases.

The provided code uses a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the graph of tangent disks. The key idea is to check if there is a way to assign coefficients to the disks such that the sum of the coefficients for the tangent disks is non-zero. This would imply that we can adjust the radii in a way that meets the problem's requirements.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the code works:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of disks `n` and their respective coordinates and radii into lists `x`, `y`, and `r`.

2. **DFS Initialization:**
   - `visited` is a list to keep track of which disks have been visited.
   - `coef0` and `coef1` are lists used to store coefficients for each disk.
   - `nodes` is a list used to store the indices of disks in the current DFS traversal.

3. **DFS Execution:**
   - For each disk `i`, if it hasn't been visited, the code initializes `coef0[i]` to 0 and `coef1[i]` to 1, and starts a DFS traversal from disk `i`.
   - The `dfs` function checks all disks `j` that are tangent to the current disk `i` (i.e., the distance between the centers of disks `i` and `j` is equal to the sum of their radii).
   - If a tangent disk `j` has not been visited, it is marked as visited, added to the `nodes` list, and its coefficients are updated based on the radii and positions of disks `i` and `j`.
   - The DFS continues recursively for all tangent disks.

4. **Coefficient Sum Check:**
   - After a DFS traversal, the code calculates the sum of `coef0` and `coef1` for all disks in the current traversal.
   - If the sum of `coef1` (denoted as `c1`) is non-zero for any DFS traversal, it means that it is possible to adjust the radii as required, and the function prints 'YES'.
   - If no such non-zero sum is found after all DFS traversals, the function prints 'NO'.

### Conclusion:

The code correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to adjust the radii of the disks according to the problem's requirements. The use of DFS to explore the graph of tangent disks and the calculation of coefficients to check for a non-zero sum is a valid approach to solve the problem.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
