Postcondition: **`i` is an integer representing the index of a disk, `x` is a list of integers representing the x-coordinates of the disks, `y` is a list of integers representing the y-coordinates of the disks, `r` is a list of integers representing the radii of the disks, `visited` is a list of booleans indicating whether a disk has been visited, `nodes` is a list that will store the indices of the disks being processed, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of coefficients used in the calculations, and `n` is the total number of disks. If `visited[i]` is False, then `visited[j]` is set to True for all disks `j` that are touching disk `i` and haven't been visited, `nodes` includes `i` and all disks `j` that are touching `i` and haven't been visited, and `coef0` and `coef1` are updated for all disks `j` that are touching `i` and haven't been visited. If `visited[i]` is True, no changes are made to `visited`, `nodes`, `coef0`, or `coef1`.**
