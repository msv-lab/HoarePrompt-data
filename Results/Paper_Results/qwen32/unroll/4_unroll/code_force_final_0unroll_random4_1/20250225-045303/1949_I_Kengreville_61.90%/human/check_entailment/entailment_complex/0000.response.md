### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in the functions `func_1` and `dfs` correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Problem Understanding:
The problem requires us to determine if we can adjust the radii of the disks such that:
1. Disks that were tangent remain tangent.
2. No two disks overlap.
3. The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

#### Key Observations:
- Two disks are tangent if the distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii.
- To maintain tangency and prevent overlap, the new radii must maintain the same tangency conditions.
- To ensure the sum of radii strictly decreases, at least one disk must have a smaller radius.

#### Approach Analysis:
- The program uses a DFS (Depth-First Search) approach to explore connected components of disks that are tangent to each other.
- For each connected component, it calculates coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) which are used to determine if it's possible to adjust the radii.

#### Detailed Breakdown:
1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads `n`, `x`, `y`, and `r` correctly.
   - It initializes `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` lists appropriately.

2. **DFS Function**:
   - The `dfs` function is called for each unvisited disk.
   - It marks the current disk as visited and adds it to the `nodes` list.
   - It then iterates through all disks to find those that are tangent to the current disk and haven't been visited.
   - For each tangent disk, it updates the coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) based on the current disk's radius and the distance between centers.

3. **Coefficient Calculation**:
   - The coefficients are calculated to ensure that the tangency conditions are maintained.
   - Specifically, `coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]` imply that the new radii must be adjusted in a way that maintains the tangency condition.

4. **Sum of Coefficients**:
   - After processing each connected component, the program checks if the sum of `coef1` (`c1`) is non-zero.
   - A non-zero `c1` indicates that it is possible to adjust the radii such that the sum of radii strictly decreases.

5. **Output Decision**:
   - If any connected component results in a non-zero `c1`, the program outputs "YES".
   - Otherwise, it outputs "NO".

#### Verification:
- The logic of maintaining tangency and preventing overlap is correctly implemented through the DFS and coefficient calculations.
- The condition for strictly decreasing the sum of radii is checked by ensuring `c1` is non-zero.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.
