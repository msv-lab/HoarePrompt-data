Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any input arguments. Instead, it reads multiple test cases from standard input (stdin). Each test case consists of two integers, `n` and `m`, representing the lengths of two binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively, followed by the binary strings `a` and `b` themselves. The function processes these test cases but does not return any value.**
