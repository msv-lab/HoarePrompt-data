The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is the number of iterations. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**
