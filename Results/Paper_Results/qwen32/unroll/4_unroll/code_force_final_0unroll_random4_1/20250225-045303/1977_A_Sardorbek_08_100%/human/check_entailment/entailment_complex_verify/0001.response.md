Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to determine whether the original assessment is correct.

### Problem Recap:
- Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move.
- We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- The number of cubes `m` can only be achieved if:
  - The difference between `n` (total moves) and `m` (target cubes) is even. This is because each pair of moves (add then remove or remove then add) leaves the number of cubes unchanged.
  - If `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because we can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
  - If `n` equals `m`, it's possible if all moves are additions, hence the answer would be "Yes".

### Program Analysis:
The program logic is as follows:
1. **If `b == c`:** The program correctly prints 'YES'. This is because if the number of moves `n` equals the number of cubes `m`, it's possible to build the tower by adding one cube in each move.
2. **If `b < c`:** The program correctly prints 'NO'. This is because if the number of moves `n` is less than the number of cubes `m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes as we can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
3. **If `b % 2 == c % 2`:** The program correctly prints 'Yes'. This is because if the parity (even or odd nature) of the number of moves `n` and the number of cubes `m` is the same, it's possible to reach `m` cubes by a combination of adding and removing cubes.
4. **Otherwise:** The program correctly prints 'No'. This covers the case where the parity of `n` and `m` is different, meaning it's not possible to reach `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Annotations:
The annotations state:
- The function reads an integer `a` representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c`.
- It then prints 'YES' if `b` equals `c`, 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`, 'YES' if both `b` and `c` have the same parity, and 'NO' otherwise.

### Evaluation:
1. **Case `b == c`:**
   - The program correctly prints 'YES'. This is accurate as explained.
2. **Case `b < c`:**
   - The program correctly prints 'NO'. This is accurate as explained.
3. **Case `b % 2 == c % 2`:**
   - The program correctly prints 'YES'. This is accurate as explained.
4. **Case `b % 2 != c % 2`:**
   - The program correctly prints 'NO'. This is accurate as explained.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program handles all cases as described in the problem statement and the annotations align with the expected behavior.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
