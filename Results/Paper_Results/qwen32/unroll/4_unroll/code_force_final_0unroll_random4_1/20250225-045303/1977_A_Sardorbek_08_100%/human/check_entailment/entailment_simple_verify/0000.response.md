### Reasoning:
Let's break down the program and the original assessment to determine the correctness.

1. **Correct Cases:**
   - If `b == c`, the program correctly prints "YES" because Nikita can simply add one cube per move.
   - If `b < c`, the program correctly prints "NO" because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves.

2. **Incorrect Case:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the logic: if `b % 2 == c % 2`, the program prints "Yes". This condition is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves. For example, if `b = 5` and `c = 1`, the condition `b % 2 == c % 2` is true (both are odd), but it's impossible to end up with 1 cube after 5 moves.

3. **Counterexample:**
   - Input: `1 5 1`
   - Expected Output: "NO"
   - Actual Output: "Yes"
   - This counterexample shows that the program fails for the given input, confirming the original assessment.

The logic `b % 2 == c % 2` is not correct because it fails to consider the parity of the difference between `b` and `c`. To determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves, the difference `b - m` must be even, as each move either adds or removes one cube, thus changing the parity of the number of cubes.

The correct condition should be:
- If `b >= c` and `(b - c) % 2 == 0`, then it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle all cases correctly and fails for certain inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
