The code snippet initializes an empty list named `pos`. This action does not affect the values of `removals`, `negatives`, or `elements`, which remain as specified in the initial state. The only change is that `pos` is now an empty list.

Output State: **removals and negatives are non-negative integers, and elements is a list of integers; pos is an empty list.**
