The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variables `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` do not affect the execution of the loop directly but represent the state within each iteration.

For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing, but they should be in a valid state as per the problem description (0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30).

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `p_1` is 0, `p_2` is 0, `p_3` is 0** (or any valid state where 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, but we initialize them to 0 for the loop to start executing without additional assumptions).
