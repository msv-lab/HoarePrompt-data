To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to analyze the provided code and understand how it processes each test case. The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, representing the scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. **Check if the sum of the scores is odd**:
   - If `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0`, the sum of the scores is odd, and the function prints `-1` and skips to the next iteration.

2. **Check if the highest score is at least the sum of the other two scores**:
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the function prints `p1 + p2` and moves to the next iteration.

3. **Adjust scores to find a valid combination**:
   - If the above conditions are not met, the function enters a `while` loop where it tries to find values `x` and `y` such that `p1 - x <= p2 - y` and `y >= x`.
   - If such values are found, it prints `p1 - x + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such values are found after the loop, it prints `p3`.

Since the output for each test case is printed directly and does not affect the state of the variables outside the loop, the state of the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` after the loop finishes is the same as their state before the loop started. The only variables that change are `x` and `y` within the `while` loop, but they are local to each iteration and do not affect the overall state.

Therefore, the output state of the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remains unchanged from the initial state after all iterations of the loop.

Given that the problem asks for the output state in the format provided, and since the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not modified outside of their local scope within each iteration, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **Each test case contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` (0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order.**
