You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `a` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c`. It then prints 'YES' if `b` equals `c`, 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`, and checks if both `a` and `b` are even to print 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine if it is possible for Nikita to have a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. There are several issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Even and Odd Moves**:
   - The condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2` is incorrect. The variable `a` here refers to the number of test cases, not the number of moves `n`. This condition should be `elif b % 2 == c % 2` to check if `n` and `m` have the same parity (both even or both odd).

2. **Handling the Case When `b == c`**:
   - The condition `if b == c: print('YES')` is correct. If the number of moves `n` is equal to the number of cubes `m`, it is possible to build the tower by adding one cube per move.

3. **Handling the Case When `b < c`**:
   - The condition `elif b < c: print('NO')` is also correct. If the number of moves `n` is less than the number of cubes `m`, it is not possible to build the tower because Nikita can only add one cube per move.

4. **Handling the Case When `b > c`**:
   - The condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2: print('Yes')` is incorrect for the reason mentioned above. It should be `elif b % 2 == c % 2: print('Yes')`. This is because if `n` and `m` have the same parity, it is possible to reach `m` cubes from 0 cubes in `n` moves by adding and removing cubes appropriately.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

In this corrected version, the condition `elif b % 2 == c % 2: print('YES')` ensures that the parity of `n` and `m` is checked correctly, which is necessary for determining if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
