To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to analyze the loop's behavior and the variables involved. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Loop Iteration**: The loop runs `a` times, where `a` is an input integer.
2. **Input Values**: For each iteration, the loop reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input.
3. **Condition Checks**:
   - If `b == c`, the loop prints 'YES'.
   - If `b < c`, the loop prints 'NO'.
   - If `a % 2 == b % 2`, the loop prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, the loop prints 'No'.

The loop does not modify the initial variables `t`, `n`, and `m`. It only processes the input values `b` and `c` for each iteration.

**Output State**: The output state consists of the printed results for each iteration of the loop, and the values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **the output state you calculate.**

Since the specific values of `b` and `c` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact printed results. However, we can describe the state after the loop finishes in terms of the unchanged variables and the printed results.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, and `a` is an input integer. The loop has printed results for each of its `a` iterations based on the conditions provided.**
