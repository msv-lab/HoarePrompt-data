Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
- Nikita can either add or remove exactly 1 cube in each move.
- The task is to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves starting from 0 cubes.

### Key Observations:
1. **Parity of Moves and Cubes**:
   - Adding or removing a cube changes the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of cubes.
   - Therefore, after an even number of moves, the number of cubes must have the same parity as the initial number of cubes (which is 0, an even number).
   - Similarly, after an odd number of moves, the number of cubes must have the opposite parity.

2. **Conditions**:
   - If `n` (number of moves) is odd, `m` (number of cubes) must be odd.
   - If `n` is even, `m` must be even.
   - If `m > n`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves because the maximum number of cubes you can have is `n` (if you add a cube in every move).

### Analysis of the Program:
Let's examine the provided code:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

1. **Reading Input**:
   - `a` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `b` is `n` (number of moves) and `c` is `m` (desired number of cubes).

2. **Logic**:
   - `if b == c:` This handles the case where the number of moves equals the number of cubes. This is a special case where it's always possible to have exactly `m` cubes if `n == m` (by adding a cube in every move).
   - `elif b < c:` This correctly identifies the case where it's impossible to have more cubes than moves, so it prints "NO".
   - `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` This is incorrect. The variable `a` is the number of test cases, not the number of moves for the current test case. It should be `elif b % 2 == c % 2:` to check if the parity of moves and cubes match.
   - `else:` This handles the case where the parity doesn't match, printing "No".

### Corrected Logic:
The correct logic should be:
- If `b == c`, print "YES".
- If `b < c`, print "NO".
- If `b % 2 == c % 2`, print "YES" (because the parity matches).
- Otherwise, print "NO".

### Conclusion:
The given program has an error in the third condition (`elif a % 2 == b % 2`). It should be `elif b % 2 == c % 2`.

Therefore, **Correctness: False**.
