Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to ensure the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Understanding and Program Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - `r` is a list to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, initialize:
     - `cx` as a set to store values for type 3 constraints.
     - `ax` to a large number (1000000000 + 7) to track the maximum value for type 2 constraints.
     - `bx` to -1 to track the minimum value for type 1 constraints.

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint:
     - If the constraint is type 1 (\( k \geq x \)), update `bx` to be the maximum of `bx` and `x`.
     - If the constraint is type 2 (\( k \leq x \)), update `ax` to be the minimum of `ax` and `x`.
     - If the constraint is type 3 (\( k \neq x \)), add `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Counting Valid \( k \)**:
   - If `bx` (minimum value from type 1 constraints) is greater than `ax` (maximum value from type 2 constraints), it is impossible to satisfy the constraints, so append 0 to `r`.
   - Otherwise, count how many values in the range `[bx, ax]` are not in `cx`:
     - Initialize `tmp` to 0.
     - For each value in `cx`, if it is within the range `[bx, ax]`, increment `tmp`.
     - Append `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` to `r`, which represents the number of integers in `[bx, ax]` that are not in `cx`.

4. **Output**:
   - Print the results for all test cases.

### Correctness Validation

The logic for processing the constraints and counting the valid integers \( k \) seems correct based on the provided function summary. Let's break down the key steps:

- **Initialization and Constraint Processing**:
  - `bx` is updated to the maximum value from type 1 constraints, ensuring that \( k \) must be at least this value.
  - `ax` is updated to the minimum value from type 2 constraints, ensuring that \( k \) must be at most this value.
  - `cx` collects all values that \( k \) must not be equal to.

- **Counting Valid \( k \)**:
  - If `bx > ax`, it means there are no integers \( k \) that can satisfy both the minimum and maximum bounds simultaneously, so the result is 0.
  - Otherwise, the program calculates the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts the count of integers in `cx` that fall within this range. This is done correctly by iterating over `cx` and checking if each value is within `[bx, ax]`.

### Testing with Example Input

Let's verify the program with the provided example input:

```plaintext

2 10

3 500000000
1 100000000
3 10000
3 900000001
```

The expected output is:

```plaintext
7
0
90
0
0
800000000
```

Let's walk through the first test case:
- Constraints: \( k \geq 3 \), \( k \leq 10 \), \( k \neq 1 \), \( k \neq 5 \)
- `bx = 3`, `ax = 10`, `cx = {1, 5}`
- Valid \( k \) values: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
- Number of valid \( k \) values: 7

The program correctly computes this result.

### Conclusion

The program handles all the constraints correctly and computes the number of valid integers \( k \) efficiently. The logic and implementation are accurate based on the problem description and the provided function summary.

Final: **True**
