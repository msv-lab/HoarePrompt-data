The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints. The following n lines each contain two integers a and x (a ∈ {1, 2, 3}, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) representing the type and value of the constraint. There is at least one constraint of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x) and at least one constraint of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x). No two constraints are the same (all pairs (a, x) are distinct).
