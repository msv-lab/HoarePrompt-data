You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints. The following n lines each contain two integers a and x (a ∈ {1, 2, 3}, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) representing the type and value of the constraint. There is at least one constraint of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x) and at least one constraint of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x). No two constraints are the same (all pairs (a, x) are distinct).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        cx = set()
        
        ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
        
        bx = -1
        
        for _ in range(n):
            a, x = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        
        if bx > ax:
            r.append(0)
        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
        
    #State: `r` is a list containing the results for each test case.
    print(*r, sep='\n')
    #This is printed: Each element of the list `r` will be printed on a new line.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) indicating the number of constraints. The following `n` lines each contain two integers `a` and `x` (where `a` is either 1 or 2, and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), representing constraints on a value `k`. Specifically, if `a` is 1, it means `k` must be greater than or equal to `x`; if `a` is 2, it means `k` must be less than or equal to `x`. The function returns the number of integers `k` that satisfy all the constraints for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
