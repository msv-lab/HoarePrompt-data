Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in handling the constraints. Specifically, the program checks if `bx > ax` to determine if there are no valid `k` values, which is correct. However, the calculation of the number of valid `k` values is incorrect. 

The issue lies in the loop where it calculates `tmp`, which counts how many elements in the set `cx` (the "not equal to" constraints) fall within the range `[bx, ax]`. The program then subtracts `tmp` from `ax - bx + 1` to get the number of valid `k` values. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly account for the range of valid `k` values when there are no "not equal to" constraints that fall within the range.

Here's a corrected version of the loop:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        cx = set()
        ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
        bx = -1
        for _ in range(n):
            (a, x) = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        if bx > ax:
            r.append(0)
        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            r.append(max(0, ax - bx + 1 - tmp))
    print(*r, sep='\n')
```

The change is the addition of `max(0, ...)` around the expression `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` to ensure that the result is not negative, which can happen if `tmp` is greater than `ax - bx + 1`. However, a more efficient and correct approach would be to use a set operation to find the valid `k` values directly:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        cx = set()
        ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
        bx = -1
        for _ in range(n):
            (a, x) = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        if bx > ax:
            r.append(0)
        else:
            valid_k = set(range(bx, ax + 1)) - cx
            r.append(len(valid_k))
    print(*r, sep='\n')
```

This version creates a set of all integers in the range `[bx, ax]` and then removes the integers that are in the set `cx` (the "not equal to" constraints). The length of the resulting set is the number of valid `k` values.
