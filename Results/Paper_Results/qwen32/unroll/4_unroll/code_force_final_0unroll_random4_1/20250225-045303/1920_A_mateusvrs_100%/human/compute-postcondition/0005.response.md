Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) indicating the number of constraints. The following `n` lines each contain two integers `a` and `x` (where `a` is either 1 or 2, and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), representing constraints on a value `k`. Specifically, if `a` is 1, it means `k` must be greater than or equal to `x`; if `a` is 2, it means `k` must be less than or equal to `x`. The function returns the number of integers `k` that satisfy all the constraints for each test case.**
