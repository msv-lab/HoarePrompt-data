Reasoning:  
The program correctly processes the input to determine the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints for each test case. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Initialization**: For each test case, the program initializes `cx` as a set to store values that `k` cannot be (type 3 constraints), `ax` as a large number (1000000000 + 7) representing the maximum possible value `k` can take (type 2 constraints), and `bx` as -1 representing the minimum possible value `k` can take (type 1 constraints).

2. **Processing Constraints**: For each constraint in the test case:
   - If the constraint is of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x), it updates `bx` to be the maximum of its current value and `x`.
   - If the constraint is of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x), it updates `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and `x`.
   - If the constraint is of type 3 (k must not be equal to x), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Checking Feasibility**: After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, it means there are no integers `k` that can satisfy both the minimum and maximum constraints simultaneously, and it appends 0 to the result list `r`.

4. **Counting Valid k Values**: If `bx` is not greater than `ax`, the program calculates the total number of integers between `bx` and `ax` inclusive (`ax - bx + 1`) and subtracts the count of integers in `cx` that fall within this range. This gives the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints.

5. **Output**: After processing all test cases, the program prints the results for each test case.

The logic and implementation of the program align correctly with the problem description, and the execution summary supports that the program behaves as expected based on the given input-output examples.

Correctness: **True**
