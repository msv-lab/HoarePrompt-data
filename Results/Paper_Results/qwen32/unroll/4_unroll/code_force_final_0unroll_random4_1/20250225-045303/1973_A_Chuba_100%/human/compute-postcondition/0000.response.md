Output State: **`t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of an integer input, which denotes the number of test cases. The conditions and values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the provided code snippet.
