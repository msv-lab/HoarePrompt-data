To determine the output state, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case. The loop iterates `t` times, processing one test case per iteration. Each test case consists of three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`, where `0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30`. Here’s a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Check if the sum of scores is odd**:
   - If the sum of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` is odd, the loop prints `-1` for that test case.
2. **Calculate the result if the sum is even**:
   - If the sum is even, the result is calculated using the formula `(p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - max(0, p_3 - p_0 - p_1)) // 2`.
   - The term `max(0, p_3 - p_0 - p_1)` ensures that the result is non-negative.

After processing all `t` test cases, the output state will contain the results for each test case in the order they were processed.

Given that the loop modifies no variables outside its scope and only prints results, the output state can be described as a series of printed results for each test case.

Output State: **The output state consists of `t` lines, each containing either `-1` if the sum of the scores for that test case is odd, or the calculated result if the sum is even.**
