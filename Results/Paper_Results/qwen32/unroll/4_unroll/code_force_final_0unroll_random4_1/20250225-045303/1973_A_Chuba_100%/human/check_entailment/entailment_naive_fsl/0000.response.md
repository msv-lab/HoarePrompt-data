Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem statement to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective:** Determine the maximum number of draws in a series of chess games among three players, given their final scores.
- **Constraints:** 
  - Scores are provided in non-decreasing order: \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).
  - Each game results in either:
    - 2 points for the winner and 0 for the loser.
    - 1 point each for a draw.
  - Output the maximum number of draws, or -1 if the scores are impossible.

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)
```

### Verification Steps:
1. **Check the Sum of Scores:**
   - The total points from all games must be even because each game awards a total of 2 points.
   - If the sum of scores is odd, it is impossible to achieve those scores, and the program correctly outputs `-1`.

2. **Calculate the Maximum Number of Draws:**
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
     \]
   - Let's analyze this formula for different cases.

### Detailed Case Analysis:
- **Case 1: No Games Played (0 0 0)**
  - Sum of scores is 0, which is even.
  - \(\max(0, 0 - 0 - 0) = 0\)
  - \(\text{result} = \frac{0 - 0}{2} = 0\)
  - Correct output: `0`.

- **Case 2: One Draw (0 1 1)**
  - Sum of scores is 2, which is even.
  - \(\max(0, 1 - 0 - 1) = 0\)
  - \(\text{result} = \frac{2 - 0}{2} = 1\)
  - Correct output: `1`.

- **Case 3: Impossible Scores (1 1 1)**
  - Sum of scores is 3, which is odd.
  - Correct output: `-1`.

- **Case 4: Two Draws (1 1 2)**
  - Sum of scores is 4, which is even.
  - \(\max(0, 2 - 1 - 1) = 0\)
  - \(\text{result} = \frac{4 - 0}{2} = 2\)
  - Correct output: `2`.

- **Case 5: Impossible Scores (3 3 3)**
  - Sum of scores is 9, which is odd.
  - Correct output: `-1`.

- **Case 6: Six Draws (3 4 5)**
  - Sum of scores is 12, which is even.
  - \(\max(0, 5 - 3 - 4) = 0\)
  - \(\text{result} = \frac{12 - 0}{2} = 6\)
  - Correct output: `6`.

- **Case 7: Two Draws (1 1 10)**
  - Sum of scores is 12, which is even.
  - \(\max(0, 10 - 1 - 1) = 8\)
  - \(\text{result} = \frac{12 - 8}{2} = 2\)
  - Correct output: `2`.

### Conclusion:
After verifying the program against multiple cases, it appears to correctly handle the conditions specified in the problem description. The formula used correctly calculates the maximum number of draws or determines if the scores are impossible.

**Correctness: True**.

The program correctly handles the given problem description for all potential cases that we have verified.
