Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Problem Analysis
We need to determine the maximum number of draws in a series of chess games between three players, given their final scores. The key points are:
- Each game results in 2 points being awarded (either 2 to the winner, 1 to each in case of a draw).
- The scores are provided in non-decreasing order (p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3).
- We need to find the maximum number of draws or determine if the scores are inconsistent.

### Program Analysis
The program follows these steps:
1. **Input Parsing**: It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the scores of the three players.
2. **Score Validation**: It checks if the total score (sum of p1, p2, and p3) is even. If the total score is odd, it prints `-1` because an odd total score is impossible since each game awards an even number of points.
3. **Draw Calculation**: If the total score is even, it calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
   \]
   This formula is derived from the need to maximize the number of draws while ensuring the scores are possible. Let's break it down:
   - The term \( \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]) \) ensures that we do not assign more points to the highest scoring player than can be explained by wins against the other two players.
   - The total score minus this term gives the total points that can be attributed to draws and wins in a balanced way.
   - Dividing by 2 gives the number of draws since each draw awards 2 points.

### Example Verification
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Input**: `0 0 0`
   - Total score = 0 (even)
   - Draws = (0 + 0 + 0 - max(0, 0 - 0 - 0)) // 2 = 0
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **Input**: `0 1 1`
   - Total score = 2 (even)
   - Draws = (0 + 1 + 1 - max(0, 1 - 0 - 1)) // 2 = 1
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Input**: `1 1 1`
   - Total score = 3 (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

4. **Input**: `1 1 2`
   - Total score = 4 (even)
   - Draws = (1 + 1 + 2 - max(0, 2 - 1 - 1)) // 2 = 2
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Input**: `3 3 3`
   - Total score = 9 (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

6. **Input**: `3 4 5`
   - Total score = 12 (even)
   - Draws = (3 + 4 + 5 - max(0, 5 - 3 - 4)) // 2 = 6
   - Output: `6` (Correct)

7. **Input**: `1 1 10`
   - Total score = 12 (even)
   - Draws = (1 + 1 + 10 - max(0, 10 - 1 - 1)) // 2 = 2
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles all the provided examples and adheres to the logic required to find the maximum number of draws or determine if the scores are inconsistent.

**Correctness: True**
