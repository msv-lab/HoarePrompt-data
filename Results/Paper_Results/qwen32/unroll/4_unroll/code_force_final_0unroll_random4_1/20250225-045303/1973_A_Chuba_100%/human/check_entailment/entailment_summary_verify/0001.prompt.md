You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three sorted scores. For each test case, it checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the function outputs `-1`. If the sum is even, it calculates and outputs a specific result based on the scores.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's break down the problem and the logic used in the code step by step.

### Problem Breakdown

The problem involves determining the maximum number of draws in a series of chess games among three players given their final scores. The constraints and the rules of the game are:
- Each game results in either a win (2 points to the winner, 0 to the loser) or a draw (1 point to each player).
- The total points awarded in each game are either 2 (for a win/loss) or 2 (for a draw).
- The scores of the players are provided in non-decreasing order: \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).
- We need to determine if the scores are possible and, if so, find the maximum number of draws.

### Key Observations

1. **Total Points Parity**: Since each game awards a total of 2 points, the sum of all players' points must be even. If the sum is odd, it's impossible to achieve these scores, and the output should be -1.
2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: To maximize the number of draws, we should minimize the number of win/loss games. The formula used in the code attempts to calculate this:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
   \]
   This formula tries to ensure that the highest score \( p_3 \) does not exceed the combined scores of the other two players by more than necessary, thus minimizing the number of win/loss games.

### Code Analysis

Let's analyze the code logic:
- The code first reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the scores \( p_1, p_2, p_3 \).
- It checks if the sum of the scores is even. If not, it prints -1.
- If the sum is even, it calculates the maximum number of draws using the above formula and prints the result.

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the code with the provided examples:

1. **Input**: `0 0 0`
   - Sum is 0 (even).
   - No games were played, so the maximum number of draws is 0.
   - **Expected Output**: `0`
   - **Actual Output**: `0`

2. **Input**: `0 1 1`
   - Sum is 2 (even).
   - One draw between the second and third player.
   - **Expected Output**: `1`
   - **Actual Output**: `1`

3. **Input**: `1 1 1`
   - Sum is 3 (odd).
   - Impossible to achieve these scores.
   - **Expected Output**: `-1`
   - **Actual Output**: `-1`

4. **Input**: `1 1 2`
   - Sum is 4 (even).
   - Two draws between the players.
   - **Expected Output**: `2`
   - **Actual Output**: `2`

5. **Input**: `3 3 3`
   - Sum is 9 (odd).
   - Impossible to achieve these scores.
   - **Expected Output**: `-1`
   - **Actual Output**: `-1`

6. **Input**: `3 4 5`
   - Sum is 12 (even).
   - Six draws between the players.
   - **Expected Output**: `6`
   - **Actual Output**: `6`

7. **Input**: `1 1 10`
   - Sum is 12 (even).
   - Two draws between the players.
   - **Expected Output**: `2`
   - **Actual Output**: `2`

The code correctly handles all the provided examples and follows the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or if the scores are impossible. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:
