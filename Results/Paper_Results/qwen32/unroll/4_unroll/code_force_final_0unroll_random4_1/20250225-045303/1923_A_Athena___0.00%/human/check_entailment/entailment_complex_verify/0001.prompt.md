You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        print(a)
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and the second line contains n integers a_i where each a_i is either 0 or 1. There is at least one 1 in each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = 0
        
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        
        print(a)
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: `t` is unchanged, `n`, `a`, and `res` are the final values from the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of a list of `n` binary integers (0s and 1s) with at least one 1. For each test case, it removes leading and trailing 0s from the list, prints the modified list, and then counts and prints the number of 0s remaining in the list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to move the chips such that they form a single contiguous block without any free cells between them. The operations allowed are moving a chip to the closest free cell to its left. The task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to achieve this.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the number of cells `n` and the list `a` representing the cells.
   - It removes any leading and trailing zeros (free cells) from the list `a`.
   - It then counts the number of zeros in the remaining list `a` and prints this count as the result.

### Flaws in the Program:
1. **Misunderstanding of the Problem**: The program simply counts the number of zeros in the non-empty segment of the list, which does not necessarily give the minimum number of operations required to form a contiguous block of chips.
2. **Incorrect Logic**: The number of operations required is not just the count of zeros in the middle of the chip block. It is the sum of distances each chip needs to move to form a contiguous block.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Identify the positions of all chips.
2. Determine the optimal position for the block of chips to be placed (which is the median position of the chips).
3. Calculate the total number of moves required to move all chips to this optimal position.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to form a single contiguous block of chips. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
