Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_i` where each `a_i` is either 0 or 1. There is at least one 1 in each test case.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the input integer, which is between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The other variables (`n` and `a_i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
