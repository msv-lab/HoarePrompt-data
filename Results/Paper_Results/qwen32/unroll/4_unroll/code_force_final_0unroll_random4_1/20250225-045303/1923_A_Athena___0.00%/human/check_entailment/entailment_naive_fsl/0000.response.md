Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips without any free cells between them. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. The program removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a`. This is not the correct approach because it changes the relative positions of the chips and the free cells, which affects the number of operations needed.

2. The program simply counts the number of zeros in the modified list `a` and prints this count as the result. This is incorrect because the number of operations required depends on the distance between chips and the closest free cells to their left, not just the number of zeros.

3. The program does not account for the fact that chips can be moved to any free cell to the left, and the goal is to minimize the total number of moves.

Here's an example where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
```
1
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Explanation of the expected output:
- The chip at position 7 can be moved to position 5, resulting in the configuration `0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0`, which requires only 1 move.
- The program, however, would count the number of zeros in the modified list `[1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]` and output `2`, which is incorrect.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should calculate the total number of moves required by considering the distance each chip needs to be moved to form a contiguous block. This involves iterating through the list and calculating the cost of moving each chip to the leftmost possible position while maintaining the order of the chips.
