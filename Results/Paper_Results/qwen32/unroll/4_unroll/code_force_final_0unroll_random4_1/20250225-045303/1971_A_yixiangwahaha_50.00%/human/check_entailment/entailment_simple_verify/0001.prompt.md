You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9

- Program: 
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, x and y are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 9.
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
        
    #State: `t` is a string representing the input value, `x` is a list of 10 integers, `y` is a list of 10 integers.
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
        
    #State: `t` is a string representing the input value, `x` is a list of 10 integers, `y` is a list of 10 integers.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step against the problem description:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`, from the input. However, it doesn't use `t` for anything, which means it assumes there are always 10 test cases. This is incorrect because the problem states that the number of test cases can vary between 1 and 100.

2. It initializes two empty lists, `x` and `y`, to store the values of the two integers for each test case.

3. It then reads the next 10 lines of input, splits each line into two parts, converts them to integers, and appends them to the `x` and `y` lists respectively. This part of the code is correct in terms of functionality but incorrect because it assumes there are always 10 test cases.

4. The program then iterates 10 times, comparing the corresponding elements in `x` and `y` lists, and prints the minimum and maximum of each pair. This logic is correct.

However, the assumption that there are always 10 test cases is a critical flaw. The program should use the value of `t` to determine how many times to read input and how many times to iterate over the lists.

Correctness: **False**
