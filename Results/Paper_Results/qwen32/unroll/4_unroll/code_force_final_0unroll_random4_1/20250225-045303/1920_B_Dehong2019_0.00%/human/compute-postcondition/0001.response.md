Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, k, and x are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n. The array a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

In this state, `t` has been assigned the value of the input integer, while all other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
