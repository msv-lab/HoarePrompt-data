Reasoning:  
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine whether the shape in the grid is a triangle or a square. The code only counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1' and checks if the first two counts are equal. This is not sufficient to determine the shape of the figure in the grid.

Here are the issues with the provided code:
1. It only checks if the first two rows with '1's have the same number of '1's, which is not a reliable way to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle.
2. It does not account for the specific patterns required for a square or a triangle (e.g., the number of '1's in each row should form a specific sequence for a triangle).
3. It does not handle the case of upside-down triangles.
4. It does not print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required in the problem statement.

Therefore, the provided code is incorrect for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
