The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an `n x n` grid of strings consisting of '0's and '1's. It then counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1'. If the counts of '1's in the first two rows are equal, it prints the list of counts. The function does not return any specific value; it only prints output for certain test cases.
