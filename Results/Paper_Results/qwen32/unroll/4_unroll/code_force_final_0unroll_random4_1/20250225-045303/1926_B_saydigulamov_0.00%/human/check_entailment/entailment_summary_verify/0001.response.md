### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description:
The task is to determine if a given binary grid of size \( n \times n \) contains a triangle or a square formed by '1's. The shapes are defined as follows:
- **Triangle**: Consists of \( k \) (where \( k > 1 \)) consecutive rows where the \( i \)-th row has \( 2 \cdot i - 1 \) consecutive '1's, centered in the column. Upside-down triangles are also valid.
- **Square**: Consists of \( k \) (where \( k > 1 \)) consecutive rows where each row has \( k \) consecutive '1's, positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an `n x n` grid of strings consisting of '0's and '1's.
- It counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1' and appends these counts to the list `k`.
- If the counts of '1's in the first two rows are equal, it prints the list `k`.

#### Original Assessment:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape formed by the '1's in the grid is a triangle or a square. The logic is flawed because:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program only appends the count of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1' to the list `k`. This is insufficient to determine the shape.
2. **Shape Determination**: The program checks if the first two elements of `k` are equal and prints the list `k` if they are. This is incorrect for determining whether the shape is a square or a triangle. Specifically:
   - For a square, all rows containing '1's should have the same number of '1's, and this number should be equal to the distance of the leftmost '1' from the left edge of the grid.
   - For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row should follow the pattern of an arithmetic sequence starting from 1 and increasing by 2 for each subsequent row (or decreasing if it's an upside-down triangle).
3. **Output**: The program does not print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required. Instead, it prints the list `k` when the first two elements are equal, which is not a valid output for the problem.

#### Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly determine the shape of the grid. Here are the reasons:

1. **Input Parsing and Counting**: The program correctly counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1'. However, this count is not sufficient to determine the shape of the grid.
2. **Logic for Shape Determination**: The program checks if the first two counts are equal and prints the list `k` if they are. This logic is incorrect because:
   - For a square, all counts should be equal, and each count should match the distance of the leftmost '1' from the left edge of the grid.
   - For a triangle, the counts should follow a specific arithmetic sequence (either increasing or decreasing by 2).
3. **Output**: The program does not produce the required output ("SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE"). Instead, it prints the list `k` under certain conditions, which is not valid.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
