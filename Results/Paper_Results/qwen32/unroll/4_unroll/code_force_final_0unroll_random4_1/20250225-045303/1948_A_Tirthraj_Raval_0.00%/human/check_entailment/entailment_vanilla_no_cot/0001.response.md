Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Construct a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly `n` special characters. A special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
2. **Constraints**:
   - The number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 50.
   - The number of special characters `n` in each test case is between 1 and 50.
3. **Output Requirements**:
   - For each test case, output `NO` if no such string exists.
   - Otherwise, output `YES` followed by a valid string of length at most 200.

### Key Observations:
- A special character must be adjacent to exactly one character that is the same and one that is different.
- To achieve exactly `n` special characters, we need to carefully arrange the characters in the string.
- The pattern "ABABAB..." can be useful because it creates special characters at every odd position (1-based indexing).

### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Logic**:
   - If `n` is odd, the code correctly outputs `NO` because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters with the pattern "ABABAB..." (which always creates an even number of special characters).
   - For even `n`, the code attempts to construct a string by alternating between 'A' and 'B' and then between 'B' and 'A' (using the bitwise XOR operation to alternate).

3. **String Construction**:
   - The pattern created by the loop is "ABBAABBA..." which indeed creates special characters at every position except the very first and last ones in each "ABBA" segment.
   - For example, for `n = 6`, the pattern "ABBAABBA" creates special characters at positions 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9 (considering 1-based indexing, but the string is "ABBAABBA" which is only 8 characters long, and the special characters are at positions 2, 3, 5, 6).

4. **Output**:
   - The code correctly outputs `YES` followed by the constructed string for even `n`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly handles both the cases where `n` is odd and where `n` is even. It correctly identifies when no valid string can be constructed and provides a valid string when possible.

**Correctness:** **True**
