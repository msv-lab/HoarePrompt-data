### Reasoning:

The problem requires generating a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly `n` special characters. A special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The program provided handles this by checking if `n` is odd or even.

1. **If `n` is odd:**
   - The program correctly outputs "NO" because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character must be flanked by different characters (one match and one non-match).

2. **If `n` is even:**
   - The program outputs "YES" and constructs a string of alternating 'A's and 'B's. This construction ensures that every character in the string (except the first and last) will be a special character because each will match one neighbor and not the other. This results in exactly `n` special characters as required.

3. **Execution States:**
   - The program seems to be correctly handling the cases as described in the example. For `n = 6`, it outputs "YES" followed by "AAABAACC", which indeed has 6 special characters. For `n = 1`, it outputs "NO", which is correct since it's impossible to have 1 special character in a string with the given conditions. For `n = 2`, it outputs "YES" followed by "MM", which is correct because "MM" has 2 special characters.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles both odd and even cases as per the problem requirements and the provided examples.

**Correctness: True**
