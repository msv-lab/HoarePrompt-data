### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to maximize the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using Type 1 and Type 2 operations.
- Type 1: Assign a permutation to a row.
- Type 2: Assign a permutation to a column.
- The goal is to achieve the maximum possible sum with no more than \( 2n \) operations.
- The maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix is given by the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \).

#### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it:
1. Reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
2. Computes the maximum sum using the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \).
3. Outputs the maximum sum and the number of operations (which is \( 2n \)).
4. For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \):
   - Performs a Type 1 operation setting row \( i \) to the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
   - Performs a Type 2 operation setting column \( i \) to the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

#### Verification:
1. **Max Sum Calculation**:
   - The formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \) is correct for the maximum sum achievable with the given operations. This formula represents the sum of the first \( n \) triangular numbers, which is the maximum sum when each row and column is filled with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

2. **Operations**:
   - For each row \( i \), the program sets the row to \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \) using a Type 1 operation.
   - For each column \( i \), the program sets the column to \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \) using a Type 2 operation.
   - This strategy ensures that the matrix is filled with the highest possible numbers, thereby maximizing the sum.
   - The number of operations \( 2n \) is within the allowed limit.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **\( n = 1 \)**: The matrix is \( 1 \times 1 \). The maximum sum is 1, and the operation is to set the single element to 1.
   - **\( n = 2 \)**: The matrix is \( 2 \times 2 \). The maximum sum is 7, and the operations are as described in the example.

#### Annotations:
The annotations confirm the programâ€™s behavior:
- The maximum sum and the number of operations are correctly printed.
- The operations (Type 1 and Type 2) are correctly described and executed for each row and column.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and provides a valid sequence of operations to achieve this sum for any \( n \). It handles all edge cases and adheres to the problem constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
