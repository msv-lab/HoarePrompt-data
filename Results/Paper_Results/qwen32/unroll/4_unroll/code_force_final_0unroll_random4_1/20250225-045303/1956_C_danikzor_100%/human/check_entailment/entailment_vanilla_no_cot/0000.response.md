Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not achieve the maximum possible sum of the matrix elements. The program fills each row and column with a decreasing sequence from `n` to `1` using both Type 1 and Type 2 operations. However, this approach does not result in the highest possible sum.

To maximize the sum, we should use each number from 1 to n exactly once in each row and each column, which can be achieved by filling the matrix with a Latin square. A simple and effective way to do this is to fill the matrix with the identity permutation for the first row, then shift the permutation for each subsequent row. This way, each number from 1 to n will appear exactly once in each row and each column, resulting in the maximum possible sum.

For example, for n=2, the optimal matrix would be:
```
1 2
2 1
```
And for n=3:
```
1 2 3
2 3 1
3 1 2
```

The sum of the matrix can be calculated as n * (n * (n + 1) / 2), which is the sum of the first n natural numbers repeated n times.

The correct program should look something like this:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    total_sum = n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)
    print(total_sum, n)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *[(j + i - 1) % n + 1 for j in range(1, n + 1)])
```

This program uses exactly n operations (one for each row) to create a Latin square, achieving the maximum possible sum.
