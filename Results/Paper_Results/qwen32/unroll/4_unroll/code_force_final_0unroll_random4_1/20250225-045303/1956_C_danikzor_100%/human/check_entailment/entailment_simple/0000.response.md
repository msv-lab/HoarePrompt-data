Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:

The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an n x n matrix using at most 2n operations. The operations allowed are:
1. Choose a row and fill it with a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.
2. Choose a column and fill it with a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.

The maximum possible sum can be derived from filling the matrix with the highest possible values in a way that maximizes the sum of all elements. The maximum sum for an n x n matrix filled with the numbers 1 to n in a way that maximizes the sum is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{n \times (n + 1) \times (4 \times n - 1)}{6} \]

### Program Analysis:

The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`. It then prints the maximum sum and the number of operations (which is `2 * n`).

The operations performed are:
1. For each row `i` from 1 to n, it performs a Type 1 operation (filling the row with the permutation `n, n-1, ..., 1`).
2. For each column `i` from 1 to n, it performs a Type 2 operation (filling the column with the permutation `n, n-1, ..., 1`).

### Correctness Verification:

1. **Maximum Sum Calculation**:
   - The formula used for the maximum sum is correct: \(\frac{n \times (n + 1) \times (4 \times n - 1)}{6}\).
   - This formula is derived from the sum of the first n natural numbers and their arrangement in a way that maximizes the sum in the matrix. It is the sum of the first n natural numbers taken 3 times with appropriate coefficients.

2. **Number of Operations**:
   - The program performs `2 * n` operations, which is within the allowed limit.

3. **Operations**:
   - The operations performed are filling each row and each column with the permutation `n, n-1, ..., 1`. This ensures that the highest possible numbers are placed in the matrix, maximizing the sum.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and performs the operations as required by the problem statement. The operations ensure that the matrix is filled in a way that maximizes the sum of all its elements.

Thus, the program is correct.

Reasoning: The program correctly calculates the maximum sum using the given formula and performs the required operations to fill the matrix with the highest possible values, ensuring the maximum sum is achieved.
Correctness: **True**
