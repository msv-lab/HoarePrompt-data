To ensure that the for loop executes, we need to focus on the variables specified in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `n`**: This is the input integer that defines the range of the loop. The loop will iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive). For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1.
2. **Variable `i`**: This is the loop variable, which is initialized to 1 at the start of the first iteration. Before the loop starts, `i` does not need to be defined because it is set by the `range` function in the loop head.

### State Adjustment:
- The state of `n` must ensure that the loop can execute. This means `n` must be at least 1.
- The variable `i` does not need to be defined before the loop starts because it is initialized by the `range` function.

### Final State:
Given the above analysis, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least 1. The variable `i` does not need to be defined.

State: **`n` must be at least 1**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once if `n` is 1 or greater.
