To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop for each set of input values `n`, `a`, and `b`. The loop processes `t` sets of these values and prints a result based on the conditions specified.

Here's a breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. **Condition `b <= a`**: If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the output is `n * a`. This means the loop prints `n` multiplied by `a` for each such case.

2. **Condition `b - a >= n`**: If the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the output is calculated using the formula `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`. This formula calculates the sum of `n` terms of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time until `n` terms are summed.

3. **Else Condition**: If neither of the above conditions is true, the output is calculated using the formula `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`. This formula calculates the sum of a partial arithmetic series starting from `a` and increasing by 1 up to `b`, and then adds `a * n` to account for the remaining terms.

After processing all `t` sets of values, the output state will be a series of `t` lines, each containing the result of the corresponding input set.

Given that the initial state describes `t` sets of inputs, the output state will be `t` lines of outputs, each determined by the conditions above.

Output State: **t lines, each containing the result of the corresponding input set based on the given conditions.**
