You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific integer value based on the conditions involving `n`, `a`, and `b`. The final state of the program is that it outputs `t` lines, each corresponding to the result of the respective test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Bob sells `n` buns. The first `k` buns are sold at a modified price `(b - i + 1)` coins, and the remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins. We need to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by choosing the optimal `k`.

### Program Analysis:
The program has three cases:
1. **Case 1: `b <= a`**
   - If the modified price is less than or equal to the usual price, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a`.
   - **Output:** `n * a`
2. **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**
   - If the difference between the modified price and the usual price is greater than or equal to the number of buns, Bob should sell all buns at the modified price.
   - **Output:** Sum of the series from `b` to `b - n + 1`.
     - This is equivalent to the formula: \(\frac{(2b - n + 1) \cdot n}{2}\)
3. **Case 3: `b - a < n`**
   - If the difference is less than the number of buns, Bob should sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining buns at the usual price.
   - **Output:** Sum of the series from `b` to `a + 1` plus the remaining buns at the usual price.
     - This is equivalent to the formula: \(\frac{(b - a) \cdot (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \cdot n\)

### Issues in the Program:
The third case in the program is incorrect. The formula for the third case does not correctly compute the maximum profit. Let's break it down:

- **Correct Formula for Case 3:**
  - Bob should sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price.
  - The sum of the series from `b` to `a + 1` is \(\frac{(b + a) \cdot (b - a + 1)}{2}\).
  - The remaining buns are sold at the usual price: `a * (n - (b - a))`.
  - **Correct Output:** \(\frac{(b + a) \cdot (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \cdot (n - (b - a))\).

### Example to Demonstrate the Issue:
Let's consider the test case:
- `n = 10, a = 10, b = 15`
- According to the problem, the optimal `k` would be 5 (i.e., sell first 5 buns at modified price and remaining 5 at usual price).
- Expected profit: \( (15 + 14 + 13 + 12 + 11) + (5 \cdot 10) = 65 + 50 = 115 \)
- Program output: \(\frac{(15 - 10) \cdot (15 - 10 + 1)}{2} + 10 \cdot 10 = \frac{5 \cdot 6}{2} + 100 = 15 + 100 = 115 \) (this is coincidentally correct for this case, but the formula is incorrect in general)

### Correct Case 3 Formula:
The correct formula for the third case should be:
```python
k = b - a
profit = (b + a) * k // 2 + a * (n - k)
```

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all cases correctly, specifically the third case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
