The code snippet `T = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `T`. This integer represents the number of test cases, `t`, which was previously described as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The values of `n`, `k`, and the list `a` are not affected by this line of code as they are related to the individual test cases which have not yet been processed.

Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15 for each test case; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each test case.**
