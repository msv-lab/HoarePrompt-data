The code initializes a list named `prime` with `True` for each index from 0 to `num`, inclusive. The value of `num` remains unchanged and is still an integer greater than or equal to 2.

Output State: **`num` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `prime` is a list of `True` values with length `num + 1`.**
