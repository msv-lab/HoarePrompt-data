The only variable in the loop head is `p`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `p`. If `p` is less than or equal to `num`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `p` is 2, and `num` is an integer greater than or equal to 2. Since `p` is 2 and `num` is at least 2, the condition `p <= num` is satisfied, and the loop can execute without any further adjustments.

State: **`num` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `prime` is a list of `True` values with length `num + 1` except `prime[0]` and `prime[1]` are `False`; `Highest_Prime` is a list of `0` values with length `num + 1`; `Lowest_Prime` is a list of `0` values with length `num + 1`; `p` is 2**
