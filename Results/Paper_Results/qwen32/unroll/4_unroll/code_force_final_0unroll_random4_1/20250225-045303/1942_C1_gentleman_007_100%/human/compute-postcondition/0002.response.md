The code snippet initializes a new list `Lowest_Prime` with `num + 1` elements, all set to `0`. The initial states of `num`, `prime`, and `Highest_Prime` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `prime` is a list of `True` values with length `num + 1`; `Highest_Prime` is a list of `0` values with length `num + 1`; `Lowest_Prime` is a list of `0` values with length `num + 1`.**
