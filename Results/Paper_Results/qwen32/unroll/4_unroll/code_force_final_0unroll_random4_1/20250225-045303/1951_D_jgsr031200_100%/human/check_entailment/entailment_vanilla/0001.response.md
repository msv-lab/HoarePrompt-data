Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

Bob wants to set up stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using at most `n` coins. Alice buys greedily, meaning she buys as many jewels as possible from the first stall, then proceeds to the next stall.

**Key Points:**
1. Alice buys greedily, so the prices must be set such that she buys exactly `k` jewels.
2. The number of stalls can be at most 60.
3. The price per jewel in each stall is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\).

### Program Analysis

The provided program seems to have a few issues based on the problem requirements:

1. **Function `func_1` Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine if it's possible to set up the stalls and what the prices should be.
   - The function starts by checking if `n` equals `k`. If true, it prints "YES" and sets up one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel. This is correct.
   - If `n` is less than `k`, it prints "NO", which is also correct.
   - The function then initializes a list `costs` with two values: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - It calculates how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall and adjusts `n` and `h` accordingly.
   - If `h` (total jewels bought) is less than `k`, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the prices.

2. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The logic for setting up the stalls and prices is not correct. The program only uses two stalls and does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - The program does not consider the possibility of using up to 60 stalls with different prices to achieve exactly `k` jewels.
   - The program does not handle all cases correctly, especially when `k` is large or when `n` is not enough to buy `k` jewels at a single price.

### Correct Solution Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to ensure that we can set up to 60 stalls with appropriate prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One way to achieve this is by using a binary representation of `k` to determine the number of stalls and their prices.

For example, if `k` is 8, we can use the binary representation `1000` (which is 2^3) and set up stalls with prices that allow Alice to buy exactly 8 jewels. Specifically, we can set up stalls with prices that are powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, etc.) and ensure that the sum of the jewels bought from these stalls equals `k`.

### Conclusion

Given the issues in the provided program, it does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
