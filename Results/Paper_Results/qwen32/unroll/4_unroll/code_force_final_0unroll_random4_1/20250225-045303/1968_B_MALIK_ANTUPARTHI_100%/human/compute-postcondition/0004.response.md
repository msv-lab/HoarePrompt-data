Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c`, and two binary strings `d` and `e` of lengths `b` and an unspecified length, respectively. It then processes these inputs to determine a value `k` and prints this value for each test case.**
