Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The approach taken in the code does not consider all possible ways to make the array elements equal using the allowed operation. The code only checks the longest prefix and suffix of the array that are the same and calculates the cost based on that, which is not sufficient for all cases.

To solve the problem, we need to consider all possible values that the array elements can be set to and calculate the minimum cost to make all elements equal to that value. This involves checking segments of the array that can be set to the same value and calculating the cost of those segments.

Here's a correct approach to solve the problem:

1. For each unique element in the array, determine the minimum cost to make all elements equal to that element.
2. To calculate the cost for a specific value, iterate through the array and count the number of segments that need to be changed to that value.
3. The cost of changing a segment is the length of the segment.
4. Track the minimum cost across all possible values.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Dictionary to store the ranges of each value in the array
        value_ranges = {}
        for i, val in enumerate(a):
            if val not in value_ranges:
                value_ranges[val] = []
            if not value_ranges[val] or value_ranges[val][-1][1] != i - 1:
                value_ranges[val].append([i, i])
            else:
                value_ranges[val][-1][1] = i
        
        min_cost = n
        for val in value_ranges:
            cost = 0
            for start, end in value_ranges[val]:
                cost += end - start + 1
            min_cost = min(min_cost, n - cost)
        
        print(min_cost)

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal by considering all possible target values and their respective segment costs.
