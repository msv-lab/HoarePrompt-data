To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all iterations, we need to understand what the loop does in each iteration.

The loop processes each test case independently. For each test case:
1. It reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers.
2. It initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the list, respectively.
3. It counts the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the left (`st`) and from the right (`end`).
4. It calculates the answer `ans` as the length of the list minus the maximum of `st` and `end`.
5. If the first and last elements of the list are equal, it recalculates `ans` as the length of the list minus the sum of `st` and `end`, ensuring it's not negative.
6. It prints the answer.

After all test cases are processed, the variables `n`, `a`, `le`, `l`, `r`, `st`, `end`, and `ans` will reflect the state of the last test case processed. However, since we are only interested in the output state after all iterations, we focus on what gets printed for each test case.

The output state will be a series of integers, each representing the result of the calculation for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `le`, `l`, `r`, `st`, `end`, and `ans` will be in their final states after the last iteration, but the primary output is the series of printed results.

Output State: **a series of integers, each representing the result of the calculation for each test case.**
