### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations. The two types of operations are:
1. Type 1: Choose a row and fill it with a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).
2. Type 2: Choose a column and fill it with a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

The optimal strategy to maximize the sum is to fill each row and each column with the permutation [1, 2, 3, ..., \( n \)]. This ensures that every element in the matrix is filled with the maximum possible value it can take, which is \( n \).

#### Program Analysis:
The program does the following:
1. For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
2. It initializes a matrix `mat` where each row is filled with the permutation [1, 2, 3, ..., \( n \)]. However, this matrix is not used further in the program.
3. It calculates the sum `res` using the formula `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for \( i \) from 0 to \( n-1 \).
4. It prints the calculated sum `res` and the number of operations (which is \( 2 * n \)).
5. It then prints the operations: for each row and column, it prints the operation of filling it with the permutation [1, 2, 3, ..., \( n \)].

#### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**: The formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` does not correctly calculate the sum of the matrix. The correct sum of the matrix when each row and column is filled with [1, 2, 3, ..., \( n \)] is \( n \times \left(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\right) \).
2. **Output Format**: The operations are printed correctly, but the sum is not.

### Correctness:
Given the issues with the sum calculation, the program is incorrect.

### Correct Implementation:
To correct the program, we need to change the sum calculation to `n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        # Correct sum calculation
        res = n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)
        print(res, n << 1)
        for i in range(n, 0, -1):
            print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
            print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))

func()
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is correct in identifying the issue with the sum calculation. The program is indeed incorrect due to this mistake.

**Final: False**
