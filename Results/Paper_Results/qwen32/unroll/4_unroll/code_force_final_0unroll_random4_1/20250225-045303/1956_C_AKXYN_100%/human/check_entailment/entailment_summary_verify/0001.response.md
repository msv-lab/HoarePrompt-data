### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical issue with the program: the incorrect calculation of the sum of the matrix elements. Let's break down the problem and the code in detail to confirm the correctness of the assessment.

### Problem Recap:
The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an `n x n` matrix using no more than `2n` operations. The optimal strategy is to fill each row and each column with the permutation `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`. This ensures that every element in the matrix is filled with the maximum possible value it can take.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Matrix Filling**:
   - The program initializes a matrix `mat` where each row is filled with the permutation `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
   - This part of the logic is correct as it ensures that each row and column will be filled with the maximum possible values.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum `res` is calculated using the formula `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`.
   - This formula is incorrect for calculating the sum of the matrix. The correct sum of the matrix when each row and column is filled with `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` is `n * (n * (n + 1) / 2)`. This is because each number from 1 to n appears exactly `n` times in the matrix (once per row and once per column).

3. **Operations Output**:
   - The program prints `2n` operations, where each operation fills a row and a column with the permutation `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
   - This part of the logic is correct as it ensures that each row and column is filled with the maximum possible values using no more than `2n` operations.

### Correct Sum Calculation:
The correct sum of the matrix when each row and column is filled with `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` is:
\[ \text{Sum} = n \times \left(\frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2}\right) \]
This formula correctly calculates the sum of all elements in the matrix.

### Correct Implementation:
The corrected version of the program should use the correct sum calculation:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        # Correct sum calculation
        res = n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)
        print(res, n << 1)
        for i in range(n, 0, -1):
            print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
            print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect due to the incorrect formula used for calculating the sum of the matrix elements. The correct sum should be `n * (n * (n + 1) / 2)`, not `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
