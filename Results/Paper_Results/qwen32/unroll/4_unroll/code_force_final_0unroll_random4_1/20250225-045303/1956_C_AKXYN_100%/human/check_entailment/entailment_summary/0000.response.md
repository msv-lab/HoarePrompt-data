### Reasoning:

Let's dissect the program and the problem to determine if the given program is correct.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an `n x n` matrix by performing a series of operations. The operations involve setting the elements of a row or column to a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`. The aim is to find a strategy that maximizes the sum of the matrix elements, and the operations should not exceed `2n`.

#### Program Analysis:
The program follows these steps for each test case:
1. **Matrix Initialization**: It initializes the matrix with rows filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
2. **Sum Calculation**: It calculates the sum `res` using the formula:
   \[
   \text{res} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \cdot (2i + 1)
   \]
   This formula can be expanded and simplified to:
   \[
   \text{res} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (2i^2 + 3i + 1)
   \]
   This sum can be further simplified using summation formulas for \(i^2\) and \(i\):
   \[
   \text{res} = 2 \cdot \frac{(n-1)n(2n-1)}{6} + 3 \cdot \frac{(n-1)n}{2} + n
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   \text{res} = \frac{n(n^2 + 5n + 6)}{3}
   \]
3. **Output Operations**: It prints the maximum sum and the number of operations (`n << 1` which is `2n`). It then prints `2n` operations, where each operation sets a row and a column to the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

#### Verification:
- **Sum Calculation**: The sum formula derived from the program matches the expected maximum sum for the matrix configuration.
- **Operations**: The program outputs `2n` operations, which is within the allowed limit. Each operation sets a row and a column to `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This strategy ensures that each element in the matrix is set to its maximum possible value given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and outputs the required operations within the constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
