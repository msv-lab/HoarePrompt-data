You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The problem involves reducing the number of cards in a hand by repeatedly exchanging `k` cards of the same number for `k-1` cards. The goal is to find the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the operations optimally.

### Key Points
1. **Exchange Operation**: You can exchange `k` cards of the same number for `k-1` cards. This operation can be performed any number of times.
2. **Objective**: Minimize the number of cards left in the hand.
3. **Constraints**: The number of cards `n` and the exchange number `k` are given, along with the numbers on the cards.

### Strategy
To minimize the number of cards, we need to focus on the most frequent card numbers. If there is a card number that appears at least `k` times, we can repeatedly exchange `k` of those cards for `k-1` cards, reducing the count of that card number by `1` each time. This process can continue until the count of that card number is less than `k`.

### Correctness Analysis
The given program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - Reading `n` (number of cards) and `k` (exchange number).
   - Reading the list of card numbers.
   - Counting the occurrences of each unique card number.
   - Checking if the maximum count of any card number is at least `k`.
   - If yes, it prints `k-1` (indicating that we can reduce the number of cards to `k-1` by exchanging the most frequent card number).
   - If no, it prints `n` (indicating that no exchange can be made, so the number of cards remains the same).

### Issues in the Program
The program's logic has a flaw. It only checks if the maximum count of any card number is at least `k` and then assumes that the minimum number of cards left will be `k-1` if true. However, this is not always correct.

For example, consider the test case:
```
6 3
10 20 30 10 20 40
```
The maximum count of any card number is `2` (for `10`, `20`, and `40`), which is less than `k=3`. Thus, no exchange can be made, and the number of cards remains `6`. The program correctly outputs `6` for this case.

However, consider another test case:
```
10 4
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
The maximum count of any card number is `10`, which is greater than `k=4`. The program outputs `k-1=3`, which is incorrect. The correct answer is `3` because we can perform the following exchanges:
- Exchange `4` ones for `3` ones (remaining: `7` ones).
- Exchange `4` ones for `3` ones (remaining: `6` ones).
- Exchange `4` ones for `3` ones (remaining: `5` ones).
- Exchange `4` ones for `3` ones (remaining: `4` ones).
- Exchange `4` ones for `3` ones (remaining: `3` ones).

Thus, the final number of cards left is `3`, not `k-1`.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when the maximum count of any card number is greater than `k`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
