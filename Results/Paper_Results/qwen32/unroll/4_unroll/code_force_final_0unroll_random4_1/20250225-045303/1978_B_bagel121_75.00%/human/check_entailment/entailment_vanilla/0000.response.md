Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

Bob has `n` buns to sell. He can choose to sell the first `k` buns at a modified price, where the price of the `i`-th bun in this group is `(b - i + 1)` coins. The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each. The goal is to determine the maximum profit Bob can make by choosing the optimal `k`.

### Key Observations

1. **If `a >= b`**: Selling all buns at the usual price `a` is always better or equal to any modified price, because the modified price cannot be higher than `a`.
2. **If `a < b`**: We need to find the optimal `k` that maximizes profit. 
    - The price of the first bun in the modified price group is `b`, the second is `b-1`, and so on.
    - The sum of the first `k` terms of this decreasing sequence is `k * (b + (b - k + 1)) / 2`.
    - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at `a` coins each, contributing `(n - k) * a` to the profit.
    - The optimal `k` is the maximum value such that the modified price is still higher than the usual price `a`, i.e., `k <= b - a + 1`.

### Code Analysis

Let's break down the code to see if it correctly implements the above logic:

1. **Reading Input**:
    - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Decision Making**:
    - **If `a >= b`**: The code correctly prints `n * a` because selling all buns at the usual price is optimal.
    - **If `a < b`**: The code calculates `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n)`, which is the correct logic to determine the maximum number of buns to sell at the modified price.
    - **Calculating Profit**:
        - The profit from the first `k` buns is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
        - The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.
        - The total profit is the sum of these two values.

3. **Output**:
    - The code prints the total profit for each test case.

### Conclusion

The code correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by choosing the optimal `k`. It handles both cases (`a >= b` and `a < b`) appropriately and calculates the profit accurately.

**Correctness: True**
