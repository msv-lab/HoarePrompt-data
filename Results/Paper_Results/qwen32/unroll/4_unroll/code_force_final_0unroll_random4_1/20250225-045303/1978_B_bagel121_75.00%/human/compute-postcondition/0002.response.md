Output State: **For each of the `t` lines, the result of the calculation based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` is printed. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the result is `n * a`. Otherwise, the result is calculated as the sum of the maximum possible sequence of `k` numbers ending at `b` and the remaining numbers multiplied by `a`.**
