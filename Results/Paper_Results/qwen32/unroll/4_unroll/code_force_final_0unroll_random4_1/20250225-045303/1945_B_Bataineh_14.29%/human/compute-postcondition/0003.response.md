The function `func` accepts a parameter `t` which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, the function receives three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `m`, each satisfying 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18. The function returns the result of some computation based on these inputs for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it receives three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. It returns the result of a computation for each test case based on these inputs.**
