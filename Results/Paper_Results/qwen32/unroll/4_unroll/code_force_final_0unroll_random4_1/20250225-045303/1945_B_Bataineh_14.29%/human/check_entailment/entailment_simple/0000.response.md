Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic in the program is flawed, particularly in the condition `if m < a or m < b:` and the corresponding output `print(2)`. This condition and its output do not align with the problem description. 

To solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time. This involves calculating the number of fireworks launched by each installation within a certain time frame and considering their visibility duration.

The program should compute the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to find the smallest time interval where the launch patterns of both installations repeat. Within this interval, we calculate how many fireworks from each installation are visible at any given time and determine the maximum overlap.

The current program incorrectly assumes that if `m` is less than `a` or `b`, the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is 2, which is not always true. Instead, it should calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the LCM period and consider their visibility overlap.

Therefore, the provided code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
