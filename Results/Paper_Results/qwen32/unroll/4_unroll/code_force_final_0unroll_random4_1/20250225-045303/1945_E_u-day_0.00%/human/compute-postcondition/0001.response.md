The code snippet provided assigns the result of `func_2()` to the variable `arr`. The initial state specifies that `arr` was a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`. After the code executes, `arr` will now hold the value returned by `func_2()`, which could be a different permutation or a completely different list of integers depending on the implementation of `func_2()`.

The values of `n`, `k`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, and `st` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is -1, `low` is 0, `high` is n-1, `st` is a set used to store midpoints visited during the binary search.**
