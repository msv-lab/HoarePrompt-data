The code snippet `n, k = func_1()` implies that the function `func_1()` returns two values, which are then assigned to the variables `n` and `k`. Given the initial state, `n` and `k` were already defined, but their values were not specified. After the execution of this code, `n` and `k` will hold the values returned by `func_1()`. The other variables (`arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, and `st`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `pos` is -1, `low` is 0, `high` is n-1, `st` is a set used to store midpoints visited during the binary search.**
