t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers n and m such that 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5. The second line contains n integers a_i such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The third line contains m integers b_i such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
