You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        y = a + b
        print(min(x, y))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        
        y = a + b
        
        print(min(x, y))
        
    #State: [output values for each test case]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three sorted scores (in non-decreasing order) for three players. For each test case, it checks if the sum of the scores is even. If the sum is odd, it outputs -1. If the sum is even, it calculates half of the total score and compares it with the sum of the first two scores, outputting the smaller of the two values.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to verify if it correctly handles all possible valid and invalid inputs as per the problem description. Let's analyze the program step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - Each test case contains three integers `p1`, `p2`, `p3` such that `0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30`.
   - The total number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 500.

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - For each test case, the output should be the maximum number of draws that could have happened, or `-1` if the scores are inconsistent with any valid set of games and results.

3. **Game Score Logic**:
   - Each game results in a total of 2 points being distributed between the two players (either 2-0 for a win, or 1-1 for a draw).
   - Therefore, the sum of the scores `p1 + p2 + p3` must be even because each game contributes an even number of points.

4. **Maximizing Draws**:
   - Draws contribute 1 point each to both players, thus maximizing draws is equivalent to minimizing the number of games that end in a win.
   - The maximum number of draws is limited by the total number of games played (`(p1 + p2 + p3) // 2`), and also by the sum of the two lower scores (`p1 + p2`).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows these steps:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the scores `p1`, `p2`, `p3`.
- It checks if the sum of the scores is even. If not, it prints `-1`.
- If the sum is even, it calculates `x = (p1 + p2 + p3) // 2` and `y = p1 + p2`.
- It prints the minimum of `x` and `y`.

### Verification:
Let's verify the correctness of the program by considering the logic:
- The check for the sum of scores being even ensures that the scores are consistent with the game rules.
- The calculation of `x` represents the total number of games played.
- The calculation of `y` represents the maximum number of draws possible if all games involving the two players with the lower scores were draws.
- The minimum of `x` and `y` correctly gives the maximum number of draws possible.

### Edge Cases:
- **No games played**: `0 0 0` should return `0`.
- **Single draw**: `0 1 1` should return `1`.
- **Invalid scores**: `1 1 1` should return `-1`.
- **Multiple draws**: `3 4 5` should return `6`.

The provided program handles all these cases correctly. Let's verify it with the example inputs:

### Example Verification:
1. **Input**: `0 0 0`
   - Sum is even (`0`), `x = 0`, `y = 0`, output: `0` (correct).

2. **Input**: `0 1 1`
   - Sum is even (`2`), `x = 1`, `y = 1`, output: `1` (correct).

3. **Input**: `1 1 1`
   - Sum is odd (`3`), output: `-1` (correct).

4. **Input**: `3 4 5`
   - Sum is even (`12`), `x = 6`, `y = 4`, output: `4` (correct).

5. **Input**: `1 1 10`
   - Sum is odd (`12`), `x = 6`, `y = 2`, output: `2` (correct).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given examples and edge cases. Therefore, the program meets the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**.
