### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided program and verify if it correctly determines the maximum number of draws or if it returns `-1` when the scores are inconsistent.

1. **Sum of Scores Check**:
   - The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is even. This is because each game results in an even number of points being distributed (either 2 points to the winner, 0 to the loser, or 1 point to each in case of a draw). Therefore, the total points after all games must be even.
   - If the sum of scores is odd, the program correctly outputs `-1` because it's impossible to achieve such a total score with valid games.

2. **Calculating Maximum Draws**:
   - When the sum of scores is even, the program calculates `x = (a + b + c) // 2`. This represents the total number of games played, as each game contributes 2 points.
   - The program then calculates `y = a + b`, which represents the total points accumulated by the two players with the lower scores.
   - The maximum number of draws can be determined by considering that each draw contributes 1 point to each player involved. To maximize draws, we need to consider the scenario where the points are distributed in such a way that the sum of points from draws is maximized.
   - The program outputs `min(x, y)`, which is a reasonable approach to determine the maximum number of draws. Here's why:
     - `x` is the total number of games, and each game can contribute at most 1 point to the total score through a draw.
     - `y` is the sum of the points of the two players with the lower scores, which gives an upper bound on the points that could have come from draws. If `y` is smaller than `x`, it means that the points accumulated by the two lower-scoring players are insufficient to account for `x` games if all games were draws. Hence, the maximum number of draws is limited by `y`.
     - If `y` is greater than or equal to `x`, then the total number of games can be fully accounted for by draws, and `x` is the maximum number of draws.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or to identify inconsistent scores. It checks the parity of the total score, and if valid, calculates the maximum possible draws based on the given constraints.

**Correctness: True**
