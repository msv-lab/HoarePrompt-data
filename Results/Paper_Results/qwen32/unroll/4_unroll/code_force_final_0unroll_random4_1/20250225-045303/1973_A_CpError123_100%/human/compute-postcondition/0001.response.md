To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means the only variable we can adjust is `t`.

For the loop to execute at least once, the value of `t` must be at least 1. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` do not affect whether the loop will execute, as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `t` is at least 1. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` can remain as they are, since they are not relevant to the execution of the loop.

State: **`p_1` is an integer (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ 30), `p_2` is an integer (p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ 30), `p_3` is an integer (p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30), `t` must be greater than 0**
