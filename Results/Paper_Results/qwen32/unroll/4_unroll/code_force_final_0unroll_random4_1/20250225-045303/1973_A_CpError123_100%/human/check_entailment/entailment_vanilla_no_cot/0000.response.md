Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened based on the given scores. Here's a detailed explanation of the issues:

1. **Condition for Valid Scores**:
   - The total points `(a + b + c)` must be even because each game contributes either 2 points (if one player wins) or 2 points (if the game is a draw). The program correctly checks this condition and returns `-1` if the sum is odd.
   
2. **Calculation of Draws**:
   - The program calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`, which represents the total number of games played (since each game contributes 2 points).
   - It then calculates `y` as `a + b`, which is the sum of the points of the two players with the lowest and middle scores.
   - The program then prints `min(x, y)`, which is not necessarily the correct maximum number of draws.

3. **Logic for Maximum Draws**:
   - To find the maximum number of draws, we need to consider the constraints and possible scenarios carefully.
   - The correct approach involves ensuring that the points can be distributed among the players in a way that respects the rules of the game. This includes checking if the points can be achieved with a combination of wins and draws.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        total_games = (a + b + c) // 2
        if a + b < c:
            print(-1)
            continue
        max_draws = min(a + b - c, total_games - (c - a))
        print(max_draws)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Check Total Points**: Ensure the total points are even.
- **Check Feasibility**: Ensure that the sum of the points of the two players with the lowest and middle scores is at least as much as the points of the player with the highest score (`a + b >= c`). This is necessary because the highest scoring player cannot have more points than the sum of the points of the other two players.
- **Calculate Maximum Draws**: The maximum number of draws is the minimum of:
  - `a + b - c`: The excess points of the two lower-scoring players over the highest-scoring player.
  - `total_games - (c - a)`: The remaining games after accounting for the necessary wins for the highest-scoring player to reach their score.

This corrected logic ensures that the program correctly computes the maximum number of draws or determines if the scores are invalid.
