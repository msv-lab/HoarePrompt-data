Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

                kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
                kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
                continue
            else:
                (x, y) = (min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i])))

                    vt = 1
                    if a[i] > b[i]:

                        kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
                    else:
                        kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                        kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
                else:
                    kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                    kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        print(kq1)
        print(kq2)





# Execution Summary:
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y` represented as strings with the same number of digits (1 to 9). For each test case, it constructs two new strings by comparing corresponding digits of `x` and `y`. If the digits are the same, they are added to both new strings. If the digits differ, the smaller digit is added to one string and the larger digit to the other, with a rule to ensure the first differing position is handled differently. The function prints two strings for each test case.
