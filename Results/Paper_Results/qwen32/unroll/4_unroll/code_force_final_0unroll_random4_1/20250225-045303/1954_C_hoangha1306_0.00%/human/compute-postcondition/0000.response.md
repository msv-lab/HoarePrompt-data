Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. For each test case, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= `x` < 10^100 and 1 <= `y` < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9. Additionally, `x` and `y` have the same number of digits.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to the integer value obtained from the input. The conditions and constraints for `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they are described for each test case that will follow.
