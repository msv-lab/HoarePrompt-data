To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. The loop head in the given code is `for num in arr:`. This means we need to ensure that `arr` is in a state that allows the loop to execute.

### Analysis:
1. **`arr`**: This is the list of integers that the loop will iterate over. For the loop to execute at least once, `arr` must contain at least one integer.
2. **`num`**: This variable will take on the value of each element in `arr` during each iteration of the loop. We don't need to adjust `num` before the loop starts because it is assigned a value within the loop.
3. **`k`**: This variable is mentioned in the state description but is not part of the loop head. Therefore, we do not need to adjust `k` for the loop to execute.
4. **`frequency_table`**: This variable is mentioned in the state description but is not part of the loop head. Therefore, we do not need to adjust `frequency_table` for the loop to execute.
5. **`n`**: This variable represents the length of `arr`. While `n` is mentioned in the state description, it is not part of the loop head. However, the condition that `n` is at least 1 is relevant for ensuring the loop executes. Therefore, we need to ensure `arr` has at least one element.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes, `arr` must contain at least one integer. The other variables (`k`, `frequency_table`, and `n`) do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Answer:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number written on a card, and `arr` must have at least one integer.**
