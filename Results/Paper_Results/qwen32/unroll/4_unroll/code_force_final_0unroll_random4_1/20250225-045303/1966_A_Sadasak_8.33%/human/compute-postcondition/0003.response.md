Output State: **The program returns `frequency_table`, which is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `arr`, and each value is the minimum of the count of that integer in `arr` and `k`.**

In simpler terms, the output is a dictionary that shows how many times each unique number from the list `arr` appears, but the count is capped at `k`.
