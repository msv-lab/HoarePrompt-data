Reasoning:

The given Python program is supposed to determine the minimum number of cards that can remain after performing the described operations. However, the current implementation of the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of cards. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function `func_1` Purpose**: The function `func_1` is meant to create a frequency table where each key is a unique number from the list `arr` and each value is the minimum of the count of that number in `arr` and `k`. However, the purpose of this frequency table in the context of the problem is unclear and it does not directly help in calculating the minimum number of cards.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cards**:
   - The logic in the main part of the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of cards. Specifically, the conditions `if k > n:`, `elif k == n:`, and the handling of the `frequency_table` values do not correctly reflect the problem requirements.
   - The problem requires understanding that for each unique card number, you can reduce the count of that card by `k-1` each time you perform the operation (i.e., you can reduce the count to `count % (k-1)` if `count % (k-1) != 0` or `k-1` if `count % (k-1) == 0` and `count >= k`).
   - The minimum number of cards left is the sum of these reduced counts for all unique card numbers.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Frequency Table**:
   - The program checks if `k` is in the values of `frequency_table` and prints `k-1` if true, which is not a correct way to determine the minimum number of cards.
   - The program does not correctly use the frequency table to compute the minimum number of cards left.

Given the above issues, the current implementation is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
