Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the allowed operations. Here are the issues with the code:

1. **Frequency Table Handling**: The function `func_1` is supposed to count the frequency of each card number, but it incorrectly limits the frequency count to `k`. This is not necessary and does not help in calculating the minimum number of cards.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cards**: The main logic in the program to determine the minimum number of cards is flawed. It incorrectly checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table and prints `k-1` if true, otherwise it prints `n`. This does not align with the problem's requirements.

3. **Handling of Operations**: The program does not correctly simulate the operations described in the problem. It should iteratively reduce the counts of the most frequent cards by `k` and add `k-1` new cards, but this logic is not implemented.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Count the frequency of each card number.
- Use a greedy approach to repeatedly reduce the count of the most frequent cards by `k` and add `k-1` new cards until no more operations can be performed.
- Calculate the remaining number of cards.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    from collections import Counter
    freq = Counter(nums)
    
    # Sort frequencies in descending order
    freq_values = sorted(freq.values(), reverse=True)
    
    # Perform operations
    remaining_cards = n
    for count in freq_values:
        while count >= k:
            count -= k
            remaining_cards -= k
            remaining_cards += k - 1
    
    print(remaining_cards)
```

This corrected program uses a `Counter` to count the frequency of each card number, sorts these frequencies in descending order, and then iteratively applies the operations to minimize the number of cards.
