### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning based on the provided annotations and the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to minimize the number of cards by repeatedly exchanging `k` cards of the same number for `k-1` cards of any number.
- The goal is to determine the minimum number of cards left after any number of such operations.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Base Cases**:
   - If `k > n`, no operations can be performed, so the result is `n`.
   - If `k == n`, one operation can be performed to reduce the count by 1, so the result is `k - 1`.

2. **General Case**:
   - Count the frequency of each card number.
   - Determine if any card number's frequency can be reduced by performing operations.
   - The minimum number of cards left is the sum of the remainders when each card number's frequency is divided by `k`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k > n` by printing `n`.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k == n` by printing `k - 1`.

3. **General Case**:
   - The function `func_1` computes the frequency of each card number, but it incorrectly caps the frequency at `k`. This is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.
   - The program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table. This check is not sufficient to determine if an operation can be performed. Instead, we need to check the remainders of the frequencies when divided by `k`.

#### Issues in the Program:
- The function `func_1` incorrectly caps the frequency at `k`. This is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.
- The check `if k in freq.values()` is not sufficient to determine if an operation can be performed. We need to check if any frequency is a multiple of `k` or can be reduced to a multiple of `k` by performing operations.

#### Correct Implementation:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Count the frequency of each card number.
- Determine the minimum number of cards left by performing operations to reduce the count of each card number to the smallest non-negative value that is not a multiple of `k`.

#### Evaluation Using Annotations:
- The annotations confirm that `func_1` caps the frequency at `k`, which is incorrect.
- The annotations show that the program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table, which is not a valid check for determining the minimum number of cards left.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is `False`.

**Final: False**
