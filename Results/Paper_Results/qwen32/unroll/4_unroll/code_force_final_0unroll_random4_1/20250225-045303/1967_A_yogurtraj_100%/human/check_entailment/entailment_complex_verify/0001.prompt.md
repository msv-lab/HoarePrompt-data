You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

    #State: A series of printed values, each corresponding to the result of a test case, based on the provided inputs and the logic of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n`, a non-negative integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates and prints a specific value based on these inputs, which represents a result derived from the sorted list and the value of `k`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to maximize the score by rearranging cards such that the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that form a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]` is maximized. The score is calculated based on how many such permutations can be formed after potentially buying up to `k` additional cards.

### Key Points:
1. **Initial Setup**: We have `n` types of cards, each with a count `a_i` for `i` from `1` to `n`.
2. **Buying Cards**: We can buy up to `k` cards, which can be of any type.
3. **Maximizing Score**: The goal is to maximize the number of permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]` in any contiguous subarray of length `n` after rearranging the cards.

### Program Analysis:
The program sorts the list `a` of card counts and iteratively attempts to equalize the counts of the cards by using the available `k` cards. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Sorting**: The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. This helps in determining the minimum number of cards needed to make the counts equal.
2. **Iterative Adjustment**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted list to find the point where it can no longer equalize the counts using the remaining `k` cards.
   - For each step, it checks if the difference in counts between consecutive elements can be filled with the remaining `k` cards.
   - If it can, it updates `k` and continues.
   - If it cannot, it calculates the new count `r` after using as many `k` cards as possible to equalize the counts up to that point.
3. **Final Calculation**:
   - If there are still `k` cards left after the loop, it uses them to increase the count of the last type of card.
   - It then calculates the score based on the final counts.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Handling Large Inputs**: The program uses integer division and modulo operations which are efficient. However, the handling of large numbers (`up to 10^12`) in the list `a` and the variable `k` should be handled correctly.
2. **Correctness of Formula**: The formula used to calculate the score `((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)` seems correct for the given problem constraints, but it's crucial to ensure that all edge cases are covered.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program should handle cases where `k` is zero, where `n` is one, and where all `a_i` are equal.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program, it appears to correctly implement the logic to maximize the score by equalizing the counts of the cards using the available `k` cards. The program handles the sorting and iterative adjustment correctly and calculates the score based on the final counts. 

Therefore, the program seems to be correct for the given problem description and constraints.
