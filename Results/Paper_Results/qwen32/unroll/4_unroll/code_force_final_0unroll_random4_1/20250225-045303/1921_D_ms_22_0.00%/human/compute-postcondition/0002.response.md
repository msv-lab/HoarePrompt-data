The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. Since `t` is within this range, it already satisfies the condition `t > 0`, and no adjustment is needed.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a_i` is a list of n integers where each a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and `b_i` is a list of m integers where each b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
