You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

Input

    5
    
    11
    
    0 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 1 1 4
    
    10
    
    0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
    
    8
    
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Output

    abracadabra
    codeforces
    a
    aaaaaaaa
    dijkstra

- Program:
def func():
    a = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    b = [0] * 26
    for t in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        r = ''
        for i in s:
            x = b.index(i)
            r += a[x]
            b[x] += 1
        print(r)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `s` of `n` integers. It then constructs and prints a string `r` of length `n` where each character corresponds to the position of the integers in `s` in a cyclic order starting from 'a' to 'z'. The function ensures that the string `r` is valid according to the given trace for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the problem description. Specifically, the code uses a fixed list `b` initialized to `[0] * 26` to keep track of how many times each letter has been used. However, this list is not reset between test cases, leading to incorrect results for subsequent test cases.

Here is a specific example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the following input:
```
2
3
0 0 0
3
0 0 0
```

The expected output for this input could be:
```
aaa
aaa
```
or any other valid string with the same trace, such as:
```
abc
abc
```

However, with the provided code, the second test case will not produce the correct result because the list `b` will not be reset to `[0] * 26` after the first test case. Instead, it will start from the state left by the first test case, leading to incorrect character assignments.

To fix this issue, the list `b` should be reset to `[0] * 26` at the beginning of each test case. Here is the corrected version of the code:
```python
def func():
    a = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    for t in range(int(input())):
        b = [0] * 26  # Reset the list for each test case
        n = int(input())
        s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        r = ''
        for i in s:
            x = b.index(i)
            r += a[x]
            b[x] += 1
        print(r)

func()
```

This ensures that each test case is handled independently, and the list `b` is correctly initialized for each one.
