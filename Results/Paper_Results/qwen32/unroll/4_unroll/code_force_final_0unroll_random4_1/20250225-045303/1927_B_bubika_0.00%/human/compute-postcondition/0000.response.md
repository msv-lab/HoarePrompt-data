The provided code snippet `a = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` assigns a string containing the lowercase English alphabet to the variable `a`. This assignment does not affect the initial state of `t`, `n`, or the list `a` (which was previously described as a list of integers). Since `a` is now being redefined as a string, the previous description of `a` as a list of integers is no longer valid.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.**
