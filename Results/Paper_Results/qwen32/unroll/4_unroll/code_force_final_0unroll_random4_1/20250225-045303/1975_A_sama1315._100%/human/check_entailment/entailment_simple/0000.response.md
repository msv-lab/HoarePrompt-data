### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into a prefix and a suffix, and these two parts are swapped.

The provided solution attempts to solve this problem by checking if any rotation of the array (achieved by concatenating the array with itself) matches the sorted version of the array. Here's how the solution works:

1. **Concatenation**: The array is concatenated with itself, which means that any possible rotation of the array can be found as a contiguous subarray within this concatenated array.
2. **Checking Rotations**: The solution then checks every possible subarray of length `n` (the original array length) within the concatenated array to see if it matches the sorted version of the original array.
3. **Return Result**: If a match is found, it means the array can be rotated to become sorted, and the function returns "Yes". If no match is found after checking all possible rotations, the function returns "No".

### Analysis:

- **Correctness**: The approach is correct because any valid rotation of the array can be found as a contiguous subarray in the concatenated array. By checking all possible subarrays of length `n`, the solution ensures that it considers every possible rotation.
- **Efficiency**: The solution is efficient given the constraints. The array length `n` is at most 50, so checking all rotations (which is `O(n^2)`) is feasible.

### Conclusion:

The provided solution correctly determines if the array can be sorted by performing the allowed operations. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
