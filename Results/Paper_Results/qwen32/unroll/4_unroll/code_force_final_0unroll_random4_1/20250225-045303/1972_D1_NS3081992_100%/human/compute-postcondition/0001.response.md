The code assigns the value `1` to the variable `i`. The values of `n` and `m`, which are the values returned by `func_7()`, remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `i` is 1.**
