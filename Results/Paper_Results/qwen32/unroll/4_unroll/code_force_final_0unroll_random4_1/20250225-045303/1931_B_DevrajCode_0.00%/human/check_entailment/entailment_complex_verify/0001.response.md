### Reasoning:

Upon analyzing the problem description, the provided program, and the annotated version, let's carefully examine the correctness of the program.

1. **Function Call Error:**
   - The program attempts to call `func_1(n, a)` before the function is defined. This will result in a `NameError` because `func_1` is not defined at the point of the function call.
   - To fix this, the function definition should come before the function call.

2. **Input Parsing Error:**
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a single list. This means that it does not correctly separate the input for different test cases.
   - The correct approach is to read the number of test cases first, then process each test case individually.

3. **Logic for Redistributing Water:**
   - The logic within `func_1` is correct. The program calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`target = total_water // n`).
   - It then iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a running total of the difference between the actual amount of water and the target amount for each container.
   - If at any point the running total becomes negative, it means there is not enough water in the previous containers to meet the target for the current container, and the function returns "No".
   - If the loop completes without the running total ever being negative, it returns "Yes", indicating that it is possible to equalize the water in all containers.

### Correctness:

Given the issues mentioned above, the program as written will not function correctly due to the `NameError` and incorrect input parsing. However, if these issues are fixed, the logic for determining whether it is possible to equalize the water in all containers is correct.

### Final Evaluation:

If the function definition is moved before the function call and the input parsing is corrected to handle multiple test cases, the logic would be correct. However, as it stands, the program is incorrect due to the syntax and input handling issues.

**Final: False**

### Revised Correctness:
If the syntax and input parsing issues are fixed, the logic is correct, and the answer would be **True**. But as it stands, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
