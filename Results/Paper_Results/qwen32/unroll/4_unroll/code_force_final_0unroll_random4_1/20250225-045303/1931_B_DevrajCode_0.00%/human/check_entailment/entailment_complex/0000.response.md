### Reasoning:
The provided code aims to determine if it is possible to redistribute water among the containers such that each container has the same amount of water. The logic of the code is based on the following steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Water and Target Water per Container**:
   - The total amount of water is calculated using `total_water = sum(a)`.
   - Since it's guaranteed that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, the target amount of water each container should have is `target = total_water // n`.

2. **Check Redistribution Feasibility**:
   - The code iterates through each container, and for each container, it calculates the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount.
   - It maintains a running balance (`container`) which accumulates the excess or deficit of water as it processes each container.
   - If at any point the running balance (`container`) becomes negative, it implies that the water cannot be redistributed such that no container has a negative amount of water at any point, and the function returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without the balance going negative, the function returns 'Yes', indicating that the water can be redistributed evenly.

### Analysis of the Code:
- The code correctly checks if the total water can be evenly distributed among the containers by ensuring the sum of water is divisible by `n`.
- The logic to check if the water can be redistributed without any container having a negative amount of water is flawed. The balance (`container`) should not go negative, but the provided explanation and the logic are correct in this regard.
- The provided example test cases in the problem statement are correctly handled by the code.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic to determine if the water can be evenly redistributed among the containers without any container having a negative amount of water at any point during the redistribution.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
