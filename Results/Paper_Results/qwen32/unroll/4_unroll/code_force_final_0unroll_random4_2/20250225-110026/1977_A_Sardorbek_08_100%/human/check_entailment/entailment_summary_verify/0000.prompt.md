You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`. It determines if it is possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes using `n` moves and prints "YES", "NO", "Yes", or "No" based on the conditions specified. The input parameters `n` and `m` remain unchanged after processing each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move.
- The goal is to determine if after `n` moves, the tower can have exactly `m` cubes.
- For each test case, output "Yes" if it's possible, otherwise "No".

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)  # This line does not affect the logic
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

#### Logic Analysis:
1. **Case 1: `b == c`**
   - If `b` (number of moves) equals `c` (desired number of cubes), the answer is "YES".
   - This is correct because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube per move.

2. **Case 2: `b < c`**
   - If the number of moves is less than the number of cubes, the answer is "NO".
   - This is correct because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves if each move can only add or remove one cube.

3. **Case 3: `b % 2 == c % 2`**
   - If the number of moves and the number of cubes have the same parity (both even or both odd), the answer is "Yes".
   - This is correct because:
     - If `b` is even, `c` can be achieved by alternating add and remove operations.
     - If `b` is odd, `c` can be achieved if it is possible to end up with the desired number of cubes after an odd number of operations.

4. **Case 4: `else`**
   - If the above conditions are not met, the answer is "No".
   - This is correct because if `b` is even and `c` is odd (or vice versa), it's impossible to end up with `c` cubes after `b` moves.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all possible cases as per the problem description. It checks if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, if the number of moves is less than the number of cubes, and if the parities of the number of moves and the number of cubes match.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly determines the possibility of achieving `m` cubes after `n` moves by considering the parity of `n` and `m` and the condition where `n` is less than `m`. There are no edge cases that the program fails to handle according to the problem description.
