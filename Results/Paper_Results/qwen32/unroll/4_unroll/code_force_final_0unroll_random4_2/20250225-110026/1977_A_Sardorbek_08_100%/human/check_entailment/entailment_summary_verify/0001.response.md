Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective:** Determine if after `n` moves, the tower can have exactly `m` cubes.
- **Operations Allowed:** 
  - Add exactly 1 cube.
  - Remove exactly 1 cube.
- **Initial State:** The tower starts with 0 cubes.
- **Constraints:** `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100`.

### Key Observations:
- **Parity Consideration:** Since each move changes the number of cubes by exactly 1, the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of cubes will change with each move.
  - If you start with 0 cubes (even), after an even number of moves, you will still have an even number of cubes.
  - After an odd number of moves, you will have an odd number of cubes.
- **Sufficient Condition:** 
  - If `n` (number of moves) and `m` (number of cubes desired) have the same parity (both odd or both even), it is possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.
  - If `n` and `m` have different parities, it is impossible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Program Analysis:
Let's examine the provided code to see if it correctly implements the above logic.

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)  # This line is unnecessary and does nothing.
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Step-by-Step Evaluation:
1. **First Condition (`b == c`):**
   - **Correctness:** If `n` (b) is equal to `m` (c), it is always possible to achieve `m` cubes by adding a cube `m` times. This condition is correct.
   - **Output:** 'YES' (case insensitive).

2. **Second Condition (`b < c`):**
   - **Correctness:** If `n` (b) is less than `m` (c), it is impossible to achieve `m` cubes since you can only add or remove one cube at a time, and you cannot add more cubes than the number of moves. This condition is correct.
   - **Output:** 'NO' (case insensitive).

3. **Third Condition (`b % 2 == c % 2`):**
   - **Correctness:** If `n` and `m` have the same parity (both odd or both even), it is possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. This condition is correct.
   - **Output:** 'Yes' (case insensitive).

4. **Else Condition:**
   - **Correctness:** If `n` and `m` have different parities, it is impossible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. This condition is correct.
   - **Output:** 'No' (case insensitive).

### Function Summary Analysis:
The function summary states that the function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`, and determines if it is possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes using `n` moves. The summary also notes that the input parameters `n` and `m` remain unchanged after processing each test case. This aligns with the program's behavior.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the parity of `n` and `m`. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
