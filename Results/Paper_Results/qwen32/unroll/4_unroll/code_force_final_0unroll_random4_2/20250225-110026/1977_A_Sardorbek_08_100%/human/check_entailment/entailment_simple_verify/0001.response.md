### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program using the provided annotations and the original assessment.

#### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective:** Determine if after `n` moves, the tower can have exactly `m` cubes.
- **Operations Allowed:**
  - Add exactly 1 cube.
  - Remove exactly 1 cube.
- **Initial State:** The tower starts with 0 cubes.
- **Constraints:** `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100`.

#### Key Observations:
- **Parity Consideration:** Since each move changes the number of cubes by exactly 1, the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of cubes will change with each move.
  - If you start with 0 cubes (even), after an even number of moves, you will still have an even number of cubes.
  - After an odd number of moves, you will have an odd number of cubes.
- **Sufficient Condition:**
  - If `n` (number of moves) and `m` (number of cubes desired) have the same parity (both odd or both even), it is possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.
  - If `n` and `m` have different parities, it is impossible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.

#### Program Analysis:

Let's examine the provided code to see if it correctly implements the above logic.

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)  # This line is unnecessary and does nothing.
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Step-by-Step Evaluation:
1. **First Condition (`b == c`):**
   - **Correctness:** If `n` (b) is equal to `m` (c), it is always possible to achieve `m` cubes by adding a cube `m` times. This condition is correct.
   - **Output:** 'YES' (case insensitive).

2. **Second Condition (`b < c`):**
   - **Correctness:** If `n` (b) is less than `m` (c), it is impossible to achieve `m` cubes since you can only add or remove one cube at a time, and you cannot add more cubes than the number of moves. This condition is correct.
   - **Output:** 'NO' (case insensitive).

3. **Third Condition (`b % 2 == c % 2`):**
   - **Correctness:** If `n` and `m` have the same parity (both odd or both even), it is possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. This condition is correct.
   - **Output:** 'Yes' (case insensitive).

4. **Else Condition:**
   - **Correctness:** If `n` and `m` have different parities, it is impossible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. This condition is correct.
   - **Output:** 'No' (case insensitive).

### Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points, and they do not indicate any issues with the logic or the flow of the program. The annotations confirm that the program correctly processes each test case and prints the appropriate result based on the conditions.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the parity of `n` and `m`. The annotations support the correctness of the program.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
