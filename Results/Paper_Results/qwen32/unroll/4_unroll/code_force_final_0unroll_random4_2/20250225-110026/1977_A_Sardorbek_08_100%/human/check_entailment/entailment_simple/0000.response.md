### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze its logic based on the problem statement. The problem requires us to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove exactly one cube.

Here's the breakdown of the logic in the program:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` (number of moves) and `m` (desired number of cubes).

2. **Logic to Determine Possibility:**
   - If `b == c` (i.e., `n == m`), the program prints 'YES'. This is correct because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube in each move.
   - If `b < c` (i.e., `n < m`), the program prints 'NO'. This is correct because it is impossible to end up with more cubes than the number of moves if each move can only add or remove one cube.
   - If `b % 2 == c % 2` (i.e., `n % 2 == m % 2`), the program prints 'Yes'. This is correct because if both `n` and `m` have the same parity (both even or both odd), it is possible to reach `m` cubes by adding and removing cubes appropriately. For example, if `n` is odd and `m` is odd, Nikita can end up with `m` cubes by making `m` additions and `(n - m)` removals (or vice versa, ensuring the total number of moves is `n`).
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints 'No'. This is correct because if `n` and `m` have different parities, it is impossible to reach `m` cubes because the net effect of `n` moves (each Â±1) will always result in a number of cubes with the same parity as `n`.

Given the above analysis, the logic in the program correctly determines whether it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
