To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic and compare it with the problem description.

The problem states that for each test case, we need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove one cube.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's logic:

1. **If `b == c`**: This checks if the number of moves `b` is equal to the number of cubes `c`. If true, it prints 'YES'. This is correct because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube in each move to end up with `m` cubes.

2. **If `b < c`**: This checks if the number of moves is less than the number of cubes. If true, it prints 'NO'. This is correct because if there are fewer moves than cubes, it's impossible to end up with `m` cubes.

3. **If `b % 2 == c % 2`**: This checks if the parity (even or odd nature) of `b` and `c` is the same. If true, it prints 'Yes'. This is correct because if the number of moves and the number of cubes have the same parity, it's possible to end up with `m` cubes. For example, if both are even, Nikita can add and remove cubes in pairs to achieve the desired number of cubes, and similarly, if both are odd, Nikita can start with one cube and then add and remove in pairs.

4. **Otherwise**: If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'No'. This is correct because if the number of moves is greater than the number of cubes and they have different parities, it's impossible to end up with exactly `m` cubes.

The provided program correctly handles all the cases as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
