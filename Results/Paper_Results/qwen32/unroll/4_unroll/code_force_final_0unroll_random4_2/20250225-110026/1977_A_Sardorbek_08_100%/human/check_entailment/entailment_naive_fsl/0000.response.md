Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move.
- The goal is to determine if after `n` moves, the tower can have exactly `m` cubes.
- For each test case, output "Yes" if it's possible, otherwise "No".

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)  # This line does not affect the logic
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

#### Logic Analysis:
1. **Case 1: `b == c`**
   - If `b` (number of moves) equals `c` (desired number of cubes), the answer is "YES".
   - This is correct because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube per move.

2. **Case 2: `b < c`**
   - If the number of moves is less than the number of cubes, the answer is "NO".
   - This is correct because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves if each move can only add or remove one cube.

3. **Case 3: `b % 2 == c % 2`**
   - If the number of moves and the number of cubes have the same parity (both even or both odd), the answer is "Yes".
   - This is correct because:
     - If `b` is even, `c` can be achieved by alternating add and remove operations.
     - If `b` is odd, `c` can be achieved if it is possible to end up with the desired number of cubes after an odd number of operations.

4. **Case 4: `else`**
   - If the above conditions are not met, the answer is "No".
   - This is correct because if `b` is even and `c` is odd (or vice versa), it's impossible to end up with `c` cubes after `b` moves.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all possible cases as per the problem description. It checks if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, if the number of moves is less than the number of cubes, and if the parities of the number of moves and the number of cubes match.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly determines the possibility of achieving `m` cubes after `n` moves by considering the parity of `n` and `m` and the condition where `n` is less than `m`. There are no edge cases that the program fails to handle according to the problem description.
