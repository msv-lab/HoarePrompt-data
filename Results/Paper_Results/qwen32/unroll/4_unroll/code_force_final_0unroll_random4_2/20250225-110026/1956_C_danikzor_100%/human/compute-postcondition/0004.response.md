Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It handles multiple test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of an n × n matrix filled with zeroes. The function processes these test cases and returns the resulting matrices. For each test case, it returns an n × n matrix filled with zeroes.**
