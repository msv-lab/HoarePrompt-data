### Reasoning:

The given problem requires us to maximize the sum of an n Ã— n matrix using a specific set of operations. The operations involve filling rows and columns with permutations of integers from 1 to n. The goal is to achieve the maximum possible sum with no more than 2n operations.

The provided program calculates the maximum sum of the matrix as `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` and outputs a sequence of operations to achieve this sum.

Let's analyze the program's logic:

1. **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
   - The formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` is the sum of the first n squares multiplied by 2 (since each number from 1 to n appears in both rows and columns).
   - This formula correctly calculates the maximum possible sum for the matrix when each row and each column contains a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.

2. **Operations:**
   - For each row `i` from 1 to n, the program performs two operations:
     - Type 1 operation: Fill the i-th row with the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 2, 1]`.
     - Type 2 operation: Fill the i-th column with the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 2, 1]`.
   - This sequence of operations ensures that each row and each column contains a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, thus achieving the maximum possible sum.

3. **Number of Operations:**
   - The program performs exactly 2n operations (2 operations for each row/column), which is within the allowed limit of no more than 2n operations.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly calculates the maximum sum and provides a valid sequence of operations to achieve this sum.

### Correctness: **True**
