To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to carefully examine the loop and understand its behavior for a given `n`.

The provided loop looks like this:

```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
    print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

### Explanation:

1. **Loop Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

2. **Print Statements:**
   - For each `i`, the loop prints two lines:
     - The first line starts with `1`, followed by `i`, and then the numbers from `n` down to `1`.
     - The second line starts with `2`, followed by `i`, and then the numbers from `n` down to `1`.

### Example for `n = 3`:

- **Iteration 1 (i = 1):**
  - First print: `1 1 3 2 1`
  - Second print: `2 1 3 2 1`

- **Iteration 2 (i = 2):**
  - First print: `1 2 3 2 1`
  - Second print: `2 2 3 2 1`

- **Iteration 3 (i = 3):**
  - First print: `1 3 3 2 1`
  - Second print: `2 3 3 2 1`

### Output State:

The loop prints `2 * n` lines, with each line containing `n + 2` integers. The output state is simply the sequence of these printed lines.

### General Output State:

For a given `n`, the output state will consist of `2 * n` lines, where each line is either:
- `1 i n (n-1) ... 2 1`
- `2 i n (n-1) ... 2 1`

This pattern repeats for each `i` from 1 to `n`.

### Final Output State:

Output State: **The output consists of 2 * n lines, with each line being either "1 i n (n-1) ... 2 1" or "2 i n (n-1) ... 2 1" for i ranging from 1 to n.**
