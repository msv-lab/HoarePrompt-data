Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. The first line of input has been read and converted to an integer, and the remaining input (including the test cases) is still to be processed.**

In natural language: The variable `t` now holds the number of test cases, which is an integer between 1 and 10,000. The first line of input has been consumed, and the subsequent lines (which include the test cases) are still waiting to be read and processed.
