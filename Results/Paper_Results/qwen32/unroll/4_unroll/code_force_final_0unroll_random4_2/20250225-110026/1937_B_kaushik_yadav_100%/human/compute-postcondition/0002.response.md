In the provided for loop, the loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `t` is at least 1, as the loop will not execute if `t` is 0.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts needs to ensure that `t` is greater than or equal to 1. The variable `_` does not need to be adjusted since it is initialized by the loop itself.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4**
