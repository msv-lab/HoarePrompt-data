The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it prints `1` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, otherwise it prints `n - 1`. The function does not modify the input values `n` and `k` but outputs a result for each test case based on the comparison between `k` and `n - 1`.
