Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob. Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Alice's Strategy**: Alice wants to maximize the sum by removing at most `k` elements. The current implementation does not consider the optimal removal of elements to maximize the sum.

2. **Bob's Strategy**: Bob wants to minimize the sum by multiplying at most `x` elements by -1. The current implementation does not correctly simulate Bob's optimal strategy after Alice has removed her elements.

The correct approach should be:

1. **Alice's Turn**: Alice should remove the `k` smallest elements from the array to maximize the sum.
2. **Bob's Turn**: Bob should flip the `x` smallest elements (after Alice's removal) to minimize the sum.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Alice removes k smallest elements
        a.sort()
        a = a[k:]
        
        # Bob flips x smallest elements
        a.sort()
        for i in range(min(x, len(a))):
            a[i] = -a[i]
        
        print(sum(a))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally according to their objectives.
