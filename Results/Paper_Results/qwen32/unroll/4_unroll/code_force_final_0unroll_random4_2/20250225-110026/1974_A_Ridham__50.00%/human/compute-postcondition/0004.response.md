The `print` statement in the given code snippet is designed to print each element of the `result` list on a new line. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what happens:

1. **Understanding the `result` list**: The `result` list contains integers, each representing the number of screens required for a corresponding pair of `x` and `y` values. However, the exact values of `x` and `y` pairs and the calculations leading to the `result` list are not provided in the initial state.

2. **`map(str, result)`**: This part of the code converts each integer in the `result` list to a string. This is necessary because the `join` method works with strings.

3. **`'\n'.join(...)`**: This joins all the string representations of the integers in the `result` list, inserting a newline character between each element. This means that each integer from the `result` list will be printed on a separate line.

4. **`print(...)`**: This outputs the final string to the console.

Since the exact values of the `result` list are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical output. However, we can describe the output format based on the provided information.

Output: **Each integer from the `result` list printed on a new line (where `result` is a list of integers representing the number of screens required for each pair of x and y processed in the loop)**
