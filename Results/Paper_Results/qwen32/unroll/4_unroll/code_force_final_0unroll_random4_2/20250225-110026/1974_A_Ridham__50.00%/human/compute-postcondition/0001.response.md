The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `result`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `x`, `y`, or `n`. Therefore, the output state will retain the initial conditions for `t`, `x`, `y`, and `n` while introducing the new variable `result` as an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is an input integer, `result` is an empty list.**
