You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100; `a` is an input integer. The loop has printed 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' for each of the `a` iterations based on the conditions specified.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. **Incorrect Condition Handling**:
   - The program checks if `b == c` and prints 'YES'. This is correct.
   - The program checks if `b < c` and prints 'NO'. This is also correct.
   - The program then checks if `a % 2 == b % 2` and prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on this condition. Here, `a` is the number of test cases, not the number of moves or cubes. The correct condition should be based on `b` (number of moves) and `c` (number of cubes).

2. **Parity Check**:
   - The condition `a % 2 == b % 2` is incorrect. The correct condition should be `b % 2 == c % 2`. This is because the difference between the number of moves (`b`) and the number of cubes (`c`) must be even for it to be possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because each move either adds or removes one cube, so the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of moves and cubes must match.

### Correct Condition:
The correct condition to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves is:
- If `b` (number of moves) is even, `c` (number of cubes) must also be even.
- If `b` (number of moves) is odd, `c` (number of cubes) must also be odd.
- Additionally, `c` (number of cubes) must be within the range `0` to `b` (inclusive), because the maximum number of cubes you can have after `b` moves is `b` (if you add a cube in every move).

### Example of Incorrect Output:
Consider the input:
```
3
3 3
2 4
5 3
```
The correct output should be:
```
Yes
No
Yes
```
However, the given program will produce incorrect results for the third test case (`5 3`), because it incorrectly checks the parity of `a` (number of test cases) instead of `b` (number of moves).

### Corrected Code:
Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected code checks the correct conditions and should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.
