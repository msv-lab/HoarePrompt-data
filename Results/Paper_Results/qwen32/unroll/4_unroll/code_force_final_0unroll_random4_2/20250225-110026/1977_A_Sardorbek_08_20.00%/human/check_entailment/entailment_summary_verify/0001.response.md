### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Nikita can either add or remove exactly 1 cube per move.
- The goal is to determine if it's possible to have a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- Key points:
  - If `n` is even, `m` must be even.
  - If `n` is odd, `m` must be odd.
  - `m` cannot exceed `n`.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program contains the following logic:
1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the values of `n` (`b`) and `m` (`c`) for each test case.
2. **Condition Checks**:
   - `if b == c:`: This condition checks if the number of moves equals the number of cubes. This is not sufficient to determine the possibility of having `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - `elif b < c:`: This correctly handles the case where the number of moves is less than the number of cubes, as it's impossible to have more cubes than moves.
   - `elif a % 2 == b % 2:`: This condition is incorrect. It checks the parity of the number of test cases `a` and the number of moves `b`, which is irrelevant. It should be checking the parity of `n` and `m`.
   - `else:`: This handles all other cases but is structured incorrectly due to the incorrect third condition.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary describes the conditions in the program, but it incorrectly states that the third condition checks the parity of `b` and `c`. The summary is misleading because the actual code checks the parity of the number of test cases `a` and the number of moves `b`.

#### Correct Conditions:
- If `b < c`, print "NO" because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves.
- If `b % 2 == c % 2`, print "YES" because `n` and `m` must have the same parity.
- Otherwise, print "NO".

#### Corrected Logic:
The corrected logic should be:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct in identifying that the logic in the provided program is flawed due to the incorrect parity check. The program should check the parity of `n` (`b`) and `m` (`c`), not `a` (`a % 2 == b % 2`).

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the given program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
