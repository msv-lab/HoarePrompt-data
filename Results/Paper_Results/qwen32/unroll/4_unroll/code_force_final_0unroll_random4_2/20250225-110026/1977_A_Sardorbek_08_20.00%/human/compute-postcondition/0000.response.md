The code snippet `a = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100; `a` is an input integer.**
