test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case. Each test case is a tuple containing a tuple (n, k, x) and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k, x <= n, and 1 <= a_i <= 1000. The length of the list of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
