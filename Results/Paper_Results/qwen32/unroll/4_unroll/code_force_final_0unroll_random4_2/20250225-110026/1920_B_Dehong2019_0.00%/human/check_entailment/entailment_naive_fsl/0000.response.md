Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Let's analyze the issues in the code:

1. **Alice's Strategy**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the sum of the array by removing up to `k` elements.
   - The code currently does not select the optimal elements to remove. Instead, it just iterates over the first `k` elements and adds them back after Bob's flips, which is incorrect.

2. **Bob's Strategy**:
   - Bob wants to minimize the sum of the array by flipping up to `x` elements to negative.
   - The code incorrectly assumes that flipping the first `x` elements will always be optimal, which is not necessarily true. Bob should flip the smallest elements to minimize the sum.

3. **Combined Strategy**:
   - The code does not consider the interaction between Alice's and Bob's moves. It should first remove the `k` smallest elements (since removing larger elements leaves more potential for Bob to flip smaller elements to negative), and then Bob should flip the smallest remaining elements.

Here is a corrected version of the code that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        # Alice removes the k smallest elements
        a = a[k:]
        
        # Bob flips the x smallest elements
        for i in range(min(x, len(a))):
            a[i] = -a[i]
        
        print(sum(a))

# This code correctly handles the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob.
```

In the original code, the logic for both Alice and Bob is flawed, leading to incorrect results in many cases. Therefore, the original code is incorrect.
