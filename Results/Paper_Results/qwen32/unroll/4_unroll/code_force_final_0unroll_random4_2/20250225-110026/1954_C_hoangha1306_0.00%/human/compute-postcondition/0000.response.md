Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. For each test case, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= `x` < 10^100 and 1 <= `y` < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9. The length of `x` and `y` is the same for each test case.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to the value of the input, which is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The conditions for `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
