The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two strings `x` and `y` of the same length, with digits ranging from 1 to 9. For each test case, it generates two new strings `kq1` and `kq2` by comparing corresponding digits of `x` and `y`. If the digits are the same, they are added to both `kq1` and `kq2`. If the digits differ, the smaller digit is added to `kq1` and the larger digit is added to `kq2` for the first occurrence of a difference, and then the opposite for subsequent differences. The function prints `kq1` and `kq2` for each test case.
