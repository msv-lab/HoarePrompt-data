The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a cost based on the provided values. The cost is determined by a specific algorithm that involves sorting and selecting elements from the list, and it adheres to constraints on the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
