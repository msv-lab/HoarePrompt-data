You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

    #State: A series of integers, each representing the cost calculated for a respective test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a cost based on the provided values. The cost is determined by a specific algorithm that involves sorting and selecting elements from the list, and it adheres to constraints on the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding
The problem requires purchasing `k` tickets over `n` days with the goal of minimizing total cost. The ticket prices on subsequent days increase based on the number of tickets bought on a given day. The constraints are:
- No more than `m` tickets can be bought on a single day.
- If `x` tickets are bought on day `i`, the price per ticket on day `i+1` and later increases by `x`.

### Program Analysis

The program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of days `n`, the maximum number of tickets that can be bought in a day `m`, and the total number of tickets `k` to be bought.
3. It reads the list of prices `M` for each day.
4. It sorts the list of prices in ascending order.
5. It calculates the number of days `q` needed to buy the tickets by dividing `k` by `m` and taking the ceiling of the result.
6. It selects the first `q` days with the lowest prices.
7. It calculates the total cost based on the number of tickets bought each day and the incremental price increase.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
   - The program does not correctly account for the incremental price increase after each purchase. Specifically, the cost calculation logic is flawed when it tries to handle the last set of tickets that might not be a full `m` tickets.
   - The cost calculation formula is incorrect and does not properly reflect the problem's requirements.

2. **Handling Remaining Tickets**:
   - When the number of tickets `k` is not a multiple of `m`, the program incorrectly calculates the cost for the remaining tickets.

3. **Incorrect Sorting and Selection**:
   - The program sorts the prices and selects the first `q` days. However, it does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets to be bought is not a multiple of `m` on the last day.

### Correct Approach

The correct approach would involve a more sophisticated algorithm, such as a greedy approach or dynamic programming, to determine the optimal days to buy tickets while considering the incremental price increase. The provided program does not implement such an approach.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in the program's logic for calculating the cost and handling the constraints, the program is incorrect.
