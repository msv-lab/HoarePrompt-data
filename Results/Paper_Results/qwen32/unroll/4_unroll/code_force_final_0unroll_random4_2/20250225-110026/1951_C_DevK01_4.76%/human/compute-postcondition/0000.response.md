Output State: **`t` is an input integer; Each test case consists of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`*`m`, 10^9). Following these integers, there is a list of `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. The number of test cases `t` is such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the input integer, representing the number of test cases. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged as the code snippet only reads the number of test cases and does not modify any other variables.
