Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers where each integer `p_i` is between 1 and `n` and `p_i` is not equal to `i` for all `i` in [1, n]. The function returns the number of cycles in the permutation defined by the list `p`.**
