The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible number `k` such that a prefix of string `a` of length `k` is a subsequence of string `b`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `k` to 0, which will count the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`. It also initializes `j` to 0, which is used to traverse string `b`.

2. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop iterates over each character in string `a` using the index `i`.

3. **Inner Loop**: The inner `while` loop continues to increment `j` as long as `j` is within the bounds of `b` and the current character in `b` (i.e., `b[j]`) does not match the current character in `a` (i.e., `a[i]`). This loop ensures that we skip over characters in `b` that do not match the current character in `a`.

4. **Character Match**: After the inner loop, if `j` is still within the bounds of `b` (i.e., `j < m`), it means we found a match for `a[i]` in `b`. We then increment `k` (since we found a matching character) and also increment `j` to move to the next character in `b` to search for the next character in `a`.

5. **Break Condition**: If `j` is not within the bounds of `b` (i.e., `j >= m`), it means we have exhausted `b` without finding a match for `a[i]`. In this case, we break out of the loop since no further characters in `a` can form a subsequence of `b`.

6. **Output**: Finally, the function prints the value of `k`, which represents the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic of the program, it correctly computes the desired result for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
