### Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` is designed to solve the problem as described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The function reads two integers `n` and `m` which represent the lengths of the binary strings `a` and `b` respectively.
   - It then reads the binary strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `k` is initialized to 0. This variable will keep track of the maximum number of characters in `a` that form a subsequence in `b`.
   - `j` is initialized to 0. This variable will be used to iterate over the string `b`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The function iterates over each character in string `a` using a for loop.
   - For each character in `a`, it uses a `while` loop to find the corresponding character in `b` starting from index `j`.
   - If a match is found (`b[j] == a[i]`), it increments `k` (indicating a successful match) and `j` (to move to the next character in `b`).
   - If no match is found by the end of `b` (`j < m` condition fails), the loop breaks as it is not possible to find more matches.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all characters in `a` or breaking early if no more matches are possible, the function prints the value of `k`, which is the maximum number of characters in `a` that form a subsequence in `b`.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with different lengths of `a` and `b`.

### Verification Against Example Test Cases:
- **First Test Case**:
  - `a = "10011"`, `b = "1110"`
  - The function correctly identifies that "10" is a subsequence of "1110" but "100" is not, thus outputting `2`.
- **Second Test Case**:
  - `a = "100"`, `b = "110"`
  - The function correctly identifies that "10" is a subsequence of "110" but "100" is not, thus outputting `2`.
- **Third Test Case**:
  - `a = "1"`, `b = "111"`
  - The function correctly identifies that "1" is a subsequence of "111", thus outputting `1`.
- **Fourth Test Case**:
  - `a = "1011"`, `b = "1111"`
  - The function correctly identifies that "101" is a subsequence of "1111" but "1011" is not, thus outputting `1`.
- **Fifth Test Case**:
  - `a = "100"`, `b = "11010"`
  - The function correctly identifies that "100" is a subsequence of "11010", thus outputting `3`.
- **Sixth Test Case**:
  - `a = "100"`, `b = "0"`
  - The function correctly identifies that no characters of "100" can be a subsequence of "0", thus outputting `0`.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of characters in `a` that form a subsequence in `b` for each test case. Therefore, the implementation is correct.

**Correctness: True**
