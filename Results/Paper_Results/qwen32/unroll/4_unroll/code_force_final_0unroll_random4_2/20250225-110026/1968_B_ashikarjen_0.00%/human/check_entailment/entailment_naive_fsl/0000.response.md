Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description:
You need to determine the maximum possible number \( k \) such that a prefix of string \( a \) of length \( k \) is a subsequence of string \( b \).

### Program:
```python
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `k` is initialized to 0, which will store the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
   - `j` is initialized to 0, which will be used to traverse string `b`.

2. **Outer Loop**:
   - The loop runs over each character in string `a` (from index 0 to \( n-1 \)).

3. **Inner Loop**:
   - The inner `while` loop increments `j` until it finds a character in `b` that matches the current character in `a` or until `j` reaches the end of `b`.

4. **Character Matching**:
   - If a match is found (`j < m`), `k` is incremented by 1 to indicate that one more character from `a` has been matched as a subsequence in `b`.
   - `j` is then incremented by 1 to move to the next character in `b`.
   - If no match is found (`j >= m`), the loop breaks, as no more characters from `a` can be matched as a subsequence in `b`.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the value of `k`, which is the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

### Verification:
- The program correctly implements the logic to find the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
- It handles all edge cases, such as:
  - When `a` is an empty string or `b` is an empty string.
  - When `a` is a subsequence of `b` in its entirety.
  - When `a` has characters that do not appear in `b`.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **First Example**:
   - \( n = 5, m = 4 \)
   - \( a = "10011" \)
   - \( b = "1110" \)
   - The longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` is `"10"`, so the output is `2`.

2. **Second Example**:
   - \( n = 3, m = 3 \)
   - \( a = "100" \)
   - \( b = "110" \)
   - The longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` is `"10"`, so the output is `2`.

3. **Third Example**:
   - \( n = 1, m = 3 \)
   - \( a = "1" \)
   - \( b = "111" \)
   - The longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` is `"1"`, so the output is `1`.

4. **Fourth Example**:
   - \( n = 4, m = 4 \)
   - \( a = "1011" \)
   - \( b = "1111" \)
   - The longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` is `"101"`, so the output is `3`.

5. **Fifth Example**:
   - \( n = 3, m = 5 \)
   - \( a = "100" \)
   - \( b = "11010" \)
   - The longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` is `"100"`, so the output is `3`.

6. **Sixth Example**:
   - \( n = 3, m = 1 \)
   - \( a = "100" \)
   - \( b = "0" \)
   - The longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` is `""`, so the output is `0`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the provided examples and edge cases. There are no known cases where the program does not produce the expected output.

Correctness: **True**.
