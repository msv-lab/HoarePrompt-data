To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all iterations, we need to analyze how the given code processes each test case.

The code snippet processes each test case by reading four integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. For each test case, it performs the following operations:

1. It checks if all three of the counts \( p_1, p_2, p_3 \) are odd. If they are, it increments the counter `cnt` by 1.
2. It then adds the integer division of each count by 2 to `cnt`.

The final value of `cnt` for each test case is printed, and `cnt` is reset to 0 at the start of each test case.

The output state is not described in terms of the original variables \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) but rather the computed value of `cnt` for each test case. However, since the problem asks for the output state in a similar format as the initial execution state, we will describe the output in terms of the computed results for each test case.

Since the output of the code is a series of computed values for each test case and not a transformation of the input variables, we can consider the output state to be a series of integers, each representing the final value of `cnt` for a given test case.

Given the problem constraints and the nature of the code, the output state cannot be represented in the exact same format as the initial state (which consists of four integers). Instead, the output state is a series of integers, each corresponding to the result of a test case.

However, if we were to describe the output state in a similar structured format for clarity, we would list the results for each test case. Since the exact test cases are not provided, we cannot list specific numbers. But the format would be something like this if we had the results:

Output State: **result1 result2 result3 ... resultt**

Since we don't have specific test cases to compute, we can't provide a concrete series of results. But the format would be a list of integers, each representing the final value of `cnt` for each test case.

For the sake of adhering to the format requested, let's assume we had computed the results for a few test cases:

Output State: **3 5 2 7**

This would mean the first test case resulted in a `cnt` value of 3, the second in 5, the third in 2, and the fourth in 7. Since we don't have actual test cases, we can't provide the exact numbers, but the format would be as described.

Thus, the most accurate representation of the output state in the requested format, without specific test case results, is:

Output State: **result1 result2 ... resultt**
