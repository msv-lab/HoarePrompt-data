Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by four non-negative integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence. The function processes \( t \) such test cases, where \( t \) is the number of test cases provided as the first input. For each test case, the function returns a result based on the counts of these integers.**
