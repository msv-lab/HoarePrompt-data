To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem and the code step-by-step.

**Problem Analysis:**
The goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally. Bob wins when the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers in the sequence is zero. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the properties of the XOR operation and how it behaves with the given constraints.

**Key Points:**
1. XOR of a number with itself is 0 (i.e., `x ^ x = 0`).
2. XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself (i.e., `x ^ 0 = x`).
3. XOR is commutative and associative.
4. We are given a sequence of integers (1, 2, 3, 4) where each integer doesn't exceed 4.

**Approach:**
- Alice wins if the XOR of the sequence is non-zero.
- Bob wins if the XOR of the sequence is zero.
- To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as many times as possible.

**Observation:**
- XOR of 1 and 3 is 2.
- XOR of 2 and 2 is 0.
- XOR of 4 and 4 is 0.
- XOR of 1, 2, 3, and 4 is 4 (since 1^2^3^4 = 4).

**Strategy:**
- If the counts of 1, 2, and 3 are all odd, the initial XOR is non-zero, and Bob can win once by removing one of these numbers.
- Eve can maximize Bob's wins by pairing numbers optimally to achieve XOR zero. For each pair of the same number, Bob can win once.

**Code Analysis:**
Let's analyze the provided code:
```python
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)
```
- The code initializes `cnt` to 0.
- It checks if the counts of 1, 2, and 3 are all odd. If so, it increments `cnt` by 1.
- It then adds the integer division of each count by 2 to `cnt`, which accounts for the pairs of each number.
- Finally, it prints `cnt` as the result for each test case.

**Verification:**
- The code correctly handles the case where the initial XOR is non-zero by checking if the counts of 1, 2, and 3 are all odd.
- It correctly counts the number of pairs for each number, which allows Bob to win when the XOR becomes zero.

**Conclusion:**
The provided code correctly implements the strategy to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.

Correctness: **True**
