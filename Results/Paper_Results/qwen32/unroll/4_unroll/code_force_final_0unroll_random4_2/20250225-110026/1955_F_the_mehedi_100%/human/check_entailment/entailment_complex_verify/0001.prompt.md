You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case is represented by four non-negative integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) (where \( 0 \le p_i \le 200 \)) indicating the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence. The function receives multiple test cases, with the first line containing an integer \( t \) (where \( 1 \le t \le 10^4 \)) representing the number of test cases.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = 0
        
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: result1 result2 ... resultt
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of four non-negative integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence. For each test case, it calculates a result based on these counts and prints the result. The final state of the program is the output of results for all test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the provided Python program correctly solves the problem, let's analyze the logic step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Game Rules**: Alice wins if the XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.
2. **XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of an even number of the same numbers is 0.
   - XOR of an odd number of the same numbers is the number itself.
   - XOR of 1, 2, 3, and 4 are 1, 10, 11, and 100 in binary respectively.
3. **Objective**: Determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally. This means Eve will try to make the XOR of the remaining numbers zero as many times as possible.

### Key Observations:
- If the count of each number (1, 2, 3, 4) is even, the XOR of all numbers is zero.
- If the count of each number (1, 2, 3, 4) is odd, the XOR of all numbers is non-zero.
- To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to make the XOR zero after each removal.
- Eve can remove pairs of the same numbers to keep the XOR zero.
- If all counts are odd initially, removing one number will make the XOR non-zero, and Eve can then pair the rest.

### Program Analysis:
The program follows these steps:
1. For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
2. It checks if all counts are odd. If so, it increments the count by 1 because Bob wins initially.
3. It then adds the floor division of each count by 2 to the count. This represents the maximum number of pairs Eve can remove while keeping the XOR zero.
4. Finally, it prints the count for each test case.

### Correctness Verification:
Let's verify the logic using the provided examples:
1. **Example 1**: `1 1 1 0`
   - All counts are not odd, so Bob wins once initially.
   - Eve can remove pairs of 1s and 3s, resulting in 1 win for Bob.
   - Total: 1

2. **Example 2**: `1 0 1 2`
   - All counts are not odd, so Bob wins once initially.
   - Eve can remove pairs of 1s and 3s, resulting in 1 win for Bob.
   - Total: 1

3. **Example 3**: `2 2 2 0`
   - All counts are even, so Bob wins initially.
   - Eve can remove pairs of 1s, 2s, and 3s, resulting in 3 wins for Bob.
   - Total: 3

4. **Example 4**: `3 3 2 0`
   - All counts are not odd, so Bob wins once initially.
   - Eve can remove pairs of 1s and 3s, resulting in 3 wins for Bob.
   - Total: 3

5. **Example 5**: `0 9 9 9`
   - All counts are odd, so Bob wins initially.
   - Eve can remove pairs of 2s, 3s, and 4s, resulting in 12 wins for Bob.
   - Total: 12

The program logic aligns with the analysis, and the results match the expected output for all examples.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.
