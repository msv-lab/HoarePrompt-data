To determine if the provided Python program correctly solves the problem, let's analyze the logic step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Game Rules**: Alice wins if the XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.
2. **XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of an even number of the same numbers is 0.
   - XOR of an odd number of the same numbers is the number itself.
   - XOR of 1, 2, 3, and 4 are 1, 10, 11, and 100 in binary respectively.
3. **Objective**: Determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally. This means Eve will try to make the XOR of the remaining numbers zero as many times as possible.

### Key Observations:
- If the count of each number (1, 2, 3, 4) is even, the XOR of all numbers is zero.
- If the count of each number (1, 2, 3, 4) is odd, the XOR of all numbers is non-zero.
- To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to make the XOR zero after each removal.
- Eve can remove pairs of the same numbers to keep the XOR zero.
- If all counts are odd initially, removing one number will make the XOR non-zero, and Eve can then pair the rest.

### Program Analysis:
The program follows these steps:
1. For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
2. It checks if all counts are odd. If so, it increments the count by 1 because Bob wins initially.
3. It then adds the floor division of each count by 2 to the count. This represents the maximum number of pairs Eve can remove while keeping the XOR zero.
4. Finally, it prints the count for each test case.

### Correctness Verification:
Let's verify the logic using the provided examples:
1. **Example 1**: `1 1 1 0`
   - All counts are not odd, so Bob wins once initially.
   - Eve can remove pairs of 1s and 3s, resulting in 1 win for Bob.
   - Total: 1

2. **Example 2**: `1 0 1 2`
   - All counts are not odd, so Bob wins once initially.
   - Eve can remove pairs of 1s and 3s, resulting in 1 win for Bob.
   - Total: 1

3. **Example 3**: `2 2 2 0`
   - All counts are even, so Bob wins initially.
   - Eve can remove pairs of 1s, 2s, and 3s, resulting in 3 wins for Bob.
   - Total: 3

4. **Example 4**: `3 3 2 0`
   - All counts are not odd, so Bob wins once initially.
   - Eve can remove pairs of 1s and 3s, resulting in 3 wins for Bob.
   - Total: 3

5. **Example 5**: `0 9 9 9`
   - All counts are odd, so Bob wins initially.
   - Eve can remove pairs of 2s, 3s, and 4s, resulting in 12 wins for Bob.
   - Total: 12

The program logic aligns with the analysis, and the results match the expected output for all examples.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.

Correctness: **True**
