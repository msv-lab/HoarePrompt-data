Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

- `s` is the input string.
- `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
- `x` is not equal to -1.
- `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns True.
- `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.

The print statement in the provided code snippet is:
```python
print(2)
```

The value to be printed is explicitly given in the print statement itself. The value `2` is directly printed without any dependency on the variables `s`, `n`, `x`, or the function `func_1`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2**
