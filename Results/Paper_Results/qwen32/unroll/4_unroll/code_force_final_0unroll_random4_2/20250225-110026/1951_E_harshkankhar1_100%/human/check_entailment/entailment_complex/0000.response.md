### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its logic to determine if it correctly meets the problem requirements.

#### Breakdown of the Code:

1. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - This function checks if the string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
   - Returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome, otherwise returns `False`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - Reads a string `s` from the input.
   - Determines the length of the string `n` and initializes `x` to -1.
   - Checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`.
     - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", the number of parts as `1`, and the entire string `s` itself.
     - If `s` is a palindrome, it proceeds to find the first position `x` where `s[i]` is not equal to `s[0]`.
     - If no such position is found (`x` remains -1), it means all characters are the same, and it prints "NO".
     - If a position `x` is found, it checks if the substring from `x+1` to the end of the string is not a palindrome.
       - If it is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", the number of parts as `2`, and the two substrings `s[:x+1]` and `s[x+1:]`.
       - If it is a palindrome, it checks if `x` is either `1` or `n // 2`.
         - If `x` is `1` or `n // 2`, it prints "NO".
         - Otherwise, it prints "YES", the number of parts as `2`, and the two substrings `s[:x+2]` and `s[x+2:]`.

#### Evaluation:

- **Case 1: Entire String is Not a Palindrome**:
  - The function correctly identifies this and outputs "YES" with the entire string as the only partition.

- **Case 2: Entire String is a Palindrome**:
  - The function correctly identifies this and checks for the first character that differs from the first character of the string.
  - If all characters are the same, it outputs "NO" as no valid partition can be made.
  - If a differing character is found, it checks further conditions to determine if a valid partition can be made.

- **Substrings Not Being Palindromes**:
  - The function ensures that the substrings generated are not palindromes by checking conditions and adjusting the partition accordingly.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - Strings with all identical characters (e.g., "lllllllll") are correctly handled by outputting "NO".
  - Strings like "uwuowouwu" are correctly partitioned into substrings that are not palindromes.

#### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly handles the problem requirements and edge cases. It ensures that the string is partitioned into substrings that are not palindromes when possible, and returns "NO" when no such partition can be made.

### Correctness:
**True**
