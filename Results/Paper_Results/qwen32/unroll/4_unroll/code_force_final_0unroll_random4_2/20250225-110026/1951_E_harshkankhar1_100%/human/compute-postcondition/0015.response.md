The provided initial state does not directly influence the output of the `print('YES')` statement. The variables `s`, `n`, `x`, and the function `func_1` are mentioned, but they do not affect the execution of the `print` statement, which simply outputs the string 'YES'.

Here's the breakdown:
- `s` is the input string.
- `n` is the length of the input string.
- `x` is not equal to -1.
- `func_1(s[x + 1:])` evaluates to `False`.

None of these conditions or variables are used in the `print('YES')` statement, so the output is straightforward.

Output: **YES**
