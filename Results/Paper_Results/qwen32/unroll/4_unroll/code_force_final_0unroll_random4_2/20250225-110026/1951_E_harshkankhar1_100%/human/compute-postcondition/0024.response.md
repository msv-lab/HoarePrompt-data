To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to understand the roles of the variables `s`, `n`, and `x` based on the given initial state.

1. **`s`**: This is the input string.
2. **`n`**: This is the length of the input string `s`, i.e., `n = len(s)`.
3. **`x`**: This is an index in the string `s` such that:
   - `x` is not equal to -1.
   - `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns True.
   - `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
```

### Explanation:
- `s[:x + 2]`: This part of the print statement slices the string `s` from the beginning up to (and including) the character at index `x + 1`. This means it captures the first `x + 2` characters of the string `s`.
- `' '`: This is a space character that is printed between the two slices.
- `s[x + 2:]`: This part of the print statement slices the string `s` from the character at index `x + 2` to the end of the string. This means it captures the substring of `s` starting right after the character at index `x + 1`.

### Output:
The output will be the concatenation of the substring from the start of `s` to index `x + 1` (inclusive), a space, and the substring from index `x + 2` to the end of `s`.

Output: **s[:x + 2] s[x + 2:] (where s[:x + 2] is the substring of s from index 0 to x + 1 inclusive, and s[x + 2:] is the substring of s from index x + 2 to the end of the string)**

To make it more precise and human-readable:
Output: **the first x+2 characters of s, followed by a space, followed by the rest of the string starting from the character at index x+2**
