You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:

The task is to partition a given string `s` into substrings such that none of the substrings is a palindrome. The program should output "YES" if such a partition is possible and provide the partition, or "NO" if it's not possible.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - This function checks if the string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
   - It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome, otherwise `False`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function handles the main logic for each test case.
   - It reads the input string `s` and calculates its length `n`.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`. If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", the number of parts `k` (which is 1), and the string `s` itself.
   - If the entire string is a palindrome, it searches for the first index `x` where `s[i]` is different from `s[0]`. This is done to find a point where the string can be split into non-palindromic parts.
   - If no such index is found (`x` remains `-1`), it means every character in the string is the same, and thus the entire string is a palindrome, so it prints "NO".
   - If a valid `x` is found, it checks if the substring starting from `x + 1` to the end of the string is not a palindrome. If it's not a palindrome, it prints "YES", the number of parts `k` (which is 2), and the two parts of the string.
   - If the substring starting from `x + 1` to the end is a palindrome, it checks if `x` is 1 or `x` is half the length of the string. If either condition is true, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES", the number of parts `k` (which is 2), and the two parts of the string.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Handling of Palindrome Substrings**:
   - The program only checks if the entire string and a substring starting from `x + 1` are palindromes. It does not ensure that the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]` (or `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`) are not palindromes, which is crucial for the problem statement.
   - For example, in the case of the string "lllllllll", the program incorrectly identifies it as having a valid partition because it checks only the substring starting from `x + 1` and not the entire partition.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the string can be split into more than two parts to avoid palindromic substrings. For example, the string "uwuowouwu" can be split into "uw", "uow", "ouwu", but the program only checks for two parts and might fail in some cases.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as it does not ensure that all substrings in the partition are non-palindromic and does not explore all possible partitions.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **False**
