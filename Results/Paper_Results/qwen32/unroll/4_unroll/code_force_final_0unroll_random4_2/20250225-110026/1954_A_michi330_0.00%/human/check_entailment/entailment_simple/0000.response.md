### Reasoning:

To determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color, we need to analyze the conditions provided:

1. **Single Part (n = 1)**: If there is only one part, Bob can trivially repaint it to any color, so the answer is always "NO".
2. **Single Color (m = 1)**: If only one color is available, Alice has no choice but to paint all parts the same color, so Bob can easily repaint any number of parts to make them all the same color. Thus, the answer is "NO".
3. **General Case**:
   - If the number of parts `n` is less than or equal to `k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color, so the answer is "NO".
   - If Alice can distribute the colors in such a way that no single color appears more than `n - k` times, Bob won't be able to repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color. This can be achieved if the maximum number of parts that can be painted with the same color is less than `k + 1`.

The formula `n - math.ceil(n / m)` determines the maximum number of parts that can be painted with the same color if the parts are distributed as evenly as possible among the `m` colors. If this value is less than `k`, Bob cannot repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color, so the answer is "YES".

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements this logic and should produce the correct output for the given problem. The conditions `if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` correctly determine when Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **True**
