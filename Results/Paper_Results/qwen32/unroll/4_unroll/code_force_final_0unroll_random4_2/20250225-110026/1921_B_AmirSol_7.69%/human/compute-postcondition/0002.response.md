To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition `i < n`. The variables `i` and `n` are the only ones relevant to the loop condition.

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5)
- `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's
- `counter` is 0
- `i` is 0

The loop condition is `i < n`. Since `n` is a positive integer and `i` is initialized to 0, the condition `i < n` is always true for the first iteration as long as `n` is at least 1, which it is according to the problem statement.

Thus, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute the first time. The state right before the loop is already sufficient for the loop to run.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, `counter` is 0, `i` is 0**
