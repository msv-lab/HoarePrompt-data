The code snippet assigns the result of the function `func_2()` to the variable `arr`. The previous values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and `arr` is updated to whatever `func_2()` returns. Since the function `func_2()` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine the exact value of `arr` after the assignment. However, we can state that `arr` will hold the value returned by `func_2()`.

Output State: **`n` is `n_new`, `k` is `k_new`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`**.
