To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop. The loop condition is `i > 1`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is greater than 1 right before the loop starts.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `N - 1`.

For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 1. Since `i` is initially set to `N - 1`, the loop will execute as long as `N - 1 > 1`, which simplifies to `N > 2`.

Since the problem states that `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `N` is assigned the value from the input, we can assume that `N` can indeed be greater than 2. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `i` if `N` is greater than 2.

However, to ensure the loop can certainly execute one time, we need to make sure `N` is at least 3. If `N` is 1 or 2, the loop condition `i > 1` will not be satisfied, and the loop will not execute.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted such that `N` is at least 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2` are integers such that 1 <= m_1, m_2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}` are integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, where 1 <= p_i <= n; `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}` are integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order, where 1 <= s_i <= n; `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned the values from the input with `N` being at least 3; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input; additionally, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`; the first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is `N`; at least one of the following conditions is true: `M1` is less than or equal to 1, `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`; `ans` is the value of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`; `cur` is `M1 - 2`; `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`; `i` is `N - 1`**
