The code calculates the midpoint between `small_element` and `big_element` and assigns it to `mid`. Given that `small_element` is `left + 1` and `big_element` is `right + 1`, the expression `(big_element - small_element + 1) // 2` computes the midpoint of the range from `small_element` to `big_element` inclusive.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number for the vertices in the range from left to right, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, and `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`.**
