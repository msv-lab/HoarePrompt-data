Functionality: **The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. `left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, and `clique` is an integer representing the clique number for the vertices in the range from `left` to `right`. The function returns an array that likely represents some structure or relationship related to the clique number for the specified range of vertices.**
