Let's analyze the loop to understand the changes it makes to the variables.

The loop iterates `mid` times, and in each iteration, it performs two main actions:
1. It assigns a value to an element in the array `arr`.
2. It assigns a value to an element in the array `cliquess`.

### Iteration Details:
- **First Iteration (i = 0):**
  - `arr[left + mid - 0 - 1] = small_element + 0`
  - `cliquess[left + 0] = clique`
  - This simplifies to:
    - `arr[left + mid - 1] = small_element`
    - `cliquess[left] = clique`

- **Second Iteration (i = 1):**
  - `arr[left + mid - 1 - 1] = small_element + 1`
  - `cliquess[left + 1] = clique`
  - This simplifies to:
    - `arr[left + mid - 2] = small_element + 1`
    - `cliquess[left + 1] = clique`

- **General Iteration (i):**
  - `arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i`
  - `cliquess[left + i] = clique`

### After the Loop:
- The loop assigns values to `mid` elements of `arr` starting from index `left + mid - 1` down to `left`.
- The loop assigns the value of `clique` to `mid` elements of `cliquess` starting from index `left` up to `left + mid - 1`.

### Output State:
- `left` and `right` remain unchanged.
- `clique` remains unchanged.
- `small_element` remains unchanged.
- `big_element` remains unchanged.
- `mid` remains unchanged.
- `not_mid` remains unchanged.
- `arr[left + mid - 1]` to `arr[left]` are set to `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` respectively.
- `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all set to `clique`.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number for the vertices in the range from left to right, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`, `arr[left + mid - 1]` to `arr[left]` are set to `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` respectively, `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all set to `clique`.**
