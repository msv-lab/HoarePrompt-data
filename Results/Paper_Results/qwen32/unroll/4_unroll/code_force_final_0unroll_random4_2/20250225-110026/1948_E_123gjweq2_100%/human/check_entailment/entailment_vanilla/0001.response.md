Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to:
1. Assign distinct integers from 1 to n to each vertex.
2. Create edges between vertices \(i\) and \(j\) if \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\).
3. Partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.
4. Print the assignments, the number of cliques, and the partition.

### Program Analysis:

#### Function `func_1(n, k)`:
- It calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
- Initializes two arrays `arr` and `cliquess` to store the assignments and clique labels respectively.
- Loops over the range of `cliques` and calls `make_array` to fill `arr` and `cliquess` with values and labels.

#### Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`:
- Calculates the middle index and the number of elements not in the middle.
- Fills the `arr` with values from `small_element` to `big_element` in a specific manner.
- Assigns the same clique label to the corresponding elements in `cliquess`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Global Variables**: The function `make_array` uses global variables `arr` and `cliquess` which are not defined within its scope. This will lead to a `NameError` at runtime.

2. **Edge Creation Logic**: The program only assigns values and labels without ensuring that the graph formed by the assignments can be partitioned into cliques as required. The logic to create edges based on the condition \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\) is missing.

3. **Minimum Clique Partition**: The program does not guarantee that the partition into cliques is minimal. It simply assigns vertices to cliques in a way that does not necessarily satisfy the clique condition.

4. **Output Format**: The program prints the arrays directly within the function `func_1`, which might not be the correct place for output handling in a larger program structure.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It does not ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques based on the edge creation condition.

**Correctness: False**

The program needs significant restructuring and logic adjustments to meet the problem requirements.
