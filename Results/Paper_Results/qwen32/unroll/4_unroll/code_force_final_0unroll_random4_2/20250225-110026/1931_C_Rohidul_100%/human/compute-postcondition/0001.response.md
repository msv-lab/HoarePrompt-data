To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand what the loop does for each test case. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - `t` test cases are given.
   - For each test case, an integer `n` (length of the list) and a list `a` of `n` integers are read.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - `l` and `r` are initialized to the start and end of the list, respectively.
   - `st` and `end` are counters for the number of consecutive elements at the start and end of the list that are the same.
   - The first `while` loop increments `l` and `st` as long as the elements at `l` and `l + 1` are the same.
   - The second `while` loop decrements `r` and `end` as long as the elements at `r` and `r - 1` are the same.
   - `ans` is calculated as the length of the list minus the maximum of `st` and `end`.
   - If the first and last elements of the list are the same, `ans` is recalculated as the length of the list minus the sum of `st` and `end`, ensuring it doesn't go below 0.
   - The value of `ans` is printed for each test case.

3. **Output State:**
   - The output state after all test cases are processed will be a series of printed values of `ans` for each test case.
   - The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `st`, `end`, and `ans` will be in their final state after the last iteration of the loop, but since the problem asks for the output state in terms of the printed results, we focus on the printed values.

Given the format requirement, the output state can be described as the sequence of printed `ans` values for each test case. Since the exact values depend on the input, we can describe the output state in a general form.

Output State: **A series of integers, each representing the value of `ans` for each test case.**
