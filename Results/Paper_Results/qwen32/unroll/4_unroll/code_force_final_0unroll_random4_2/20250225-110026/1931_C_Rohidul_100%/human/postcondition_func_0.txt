The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints an integer value `ans` that represents the minimum number of elements to remove from the list `a` to make it non-increasing or non-decreasing by removing elements from either the beginning or the end of the list.
