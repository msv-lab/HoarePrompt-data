### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is correct.

#### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code does not seem to follow the logic described in the problem statement. Instead, it calculates a value based on divisors and sums, which does not align with the requirement of checking pairs \((a, b)\) for the given condition.

Here is the provided code for reference:
```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = n
    root = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1
    for i in range(2, root + 1):
        cnt = i * i
        ans += (n + i) // cnt
    print(ans)
```

#### Function Summary Recap:
The function `func_1` reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from the input, calculates a value `ans` based on `n`, and prints this value. The calculation involves summing up `n` plus the integer division of `(n + i)` by `(i * i)` for all `i` from `2` to the integer square root of `n` plus one. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value; it directly prints the result.

#### Original Assessment Recap:
The original assessment states that the provided program is incorrect because it does not follow the logic required to solve the problem. The code does not iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Verification:
To verify the correctness, we need to check if the code implements the logic described in the problem statement. Given the function summary and the code, it is clear that the code is not iterating over pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition. Instead, it performs a different calculation that does not relate to the problem.

#### Counterexample:
The original assessment provides a counterexample:
- Input: `1 3 3`
- Expected Output: `4`

The provided code will not produce the correct output for this input because it does not check the condition for pairs \((a, b)\).

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the original assessment is correct. The provided code does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
