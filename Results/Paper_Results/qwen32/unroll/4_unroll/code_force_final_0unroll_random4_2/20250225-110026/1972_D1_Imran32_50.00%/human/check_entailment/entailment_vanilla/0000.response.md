Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:

The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \(k\).

### Simplifying the Condition:

Let \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then we can write \(a = dx\) and \(b = dy\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). The condition becomes:
\[ dx + dy = k \cdot dy \cdot d \]
\[ x + y = k \cdot d \cdot y \]
\[ x = (k \cdot d - 1) \cdot y \]

This implies that \(x\) must be a multiple of \(y\) and \((k \cdot d - 1)\) must be an integer. Since \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, \(y\) must be 1 (otherwise, \(x\) and \(y\) would have a common factor greater than 1). Therefore, \(x = k \cdot d - 1\).

Thus, \(a = d \cdot (k \cdot d - 1)\) and \(b = d\). We need to find all such pairs \((a, b)\) within the given ranges.

### The Provided Program Analysis:

The provided program does not seem to correctly implement the logic described above. Instead, it appears to be calculating something related to the divisor sum function, which is not directly related to the problem at hand.

The program reads the number of test cases and then calls `func_1()` for each test case. The function `func_1()` reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (note that the second integer is incorrectly named as \(k\) instead of \(m\)), and then calculates a value `ans` based on a loop over divisors of numbers up to \(\sqrt{n}\).

This logic does not match the required condition for the pairs \((a, b)\) as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the program does not match the requirements of the problem.

**Correctness: False**
