Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Key Observations:
- The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be simplified by letting \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then \(a = dx\) and \(b = dy\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). The condition becomes:
  \[
  dx + dy = d(x + y) \text{ is a multiple of } d \cdot y = dy \cdot d = dy \cdot \gcd(x, y) = dy
  \]
  Simplifying further, we get:
  \[
  x + y \text{ is a multiple of } y
  \]
  This implies:
  \[
  x = ky \text{ for some integer } k
  \]
  Since \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), the only possible value for \(k\) is 1, meaning \(x = 1\). Therefore, \(a = d \cdot 1 = d\) and \(b = d \cdot y\).

- The number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) is determined by counting all possible values of \(d\) and \(y\) such that \(a \le n\) and \(b \le m\).

### Correct Program Approach:
The correct approach involves iterating through all possible values of \(d\) and \(y\) and counting the valid pairs. However, the provided program does not follow this approach.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it calls `func_1()`. Inside `func_1()`, it reads \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\)), initializes `ans` to \(n\), and then iterates from 2 to the square root of \(n\), updating `ans` based on a formula that doesn't align with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as described in the problem statement. It appears to be solving a different problem or using a different approach that is not applicable here.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given problem constraints.
Correctness: **False**
