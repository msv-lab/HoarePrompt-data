You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Key Observations:
- The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be simplified by letting \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then \(a = dx\) and \(b = dy\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). The condition becomes:
  \[
  dx + dy = d(x + y) \text{ is a multiple of } d \cdot y = dy \cdot d = dy \cdot \gcd(x, y) = dy
  \]
  Simplifying further, we get:
  \[
  x + y \text{ is a multiple of } y
  \]
  This implies:
  \[
  x = ky \text{ for some integer } k
  \]
  Since \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), the only possible value for \(k\) is 1, meaning \(x = 1\). Therefore, \(a = d \cdot 1 = d\) and \(b = d \cdot y\).

- The number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) is determined by counting all possible values of \(d\) and \(y\) such that \(a \le n\) and \(b \le m\).

### Correct Program Approach:
The correct approach involves iterating through all possible values of \(d\) and \(y\) and counting the valid pairs. However, the provided program does not follow this approach.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it calls `func_1()`. Inside `func_1()`, it reads \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\)), initializes `ans` to \(n\), and then iterates from 2 to the square root of \(n\), updating `ans` based on a formula that doesn't align with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as described in the problem statement. It appears to be solving a different problem or using a different approach that is not applicable here.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given problem constraints.
Correctness: **False**
