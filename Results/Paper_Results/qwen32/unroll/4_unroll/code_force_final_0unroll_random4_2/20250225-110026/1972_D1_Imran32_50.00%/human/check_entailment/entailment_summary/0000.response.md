Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the given program does not perform any operations related to the gcd or the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it calculates a value `ans` based on a different formula involving square roots and integer divisions, which is unrelated to the problem statement.

The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` (note that `k` should be `m` according to the problem statement), initializes `ans` to `n`, and then iterates from `2` to the integer square root of `n` plus one, adding the integer division of `(n + i)` by `(i * i)` to `ans`. This calculation is not relevant to the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
