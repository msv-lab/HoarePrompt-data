You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of three positive integers a, b, and m (1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18), where a and b represent the frequencies of launching fireworks for the first and second installations, respectively, and m represents the duration (in minutes) that each firework is visible in the sky after launch. There are t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) such test cases.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if m < a or m < b:
            print(2)
        else:
            print(m // a + m // b + 2)
        
    #State: the sequence of printed results for each test case, which is either `2` or `m // a + m // b + 2` depending on the condition `m < a or m < b`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. Here, `a` and `b` represent the frequencies of launching fireworks for the first and second installations, respectively, and `m` represents the duration (in minutes) that each firework is visible in the sky after launch. For each test case, the function returns the total number of minutes during which fireworks are visible in the sky.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
