You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it computes and prints the minimum cost, which is either `a * n` or `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`, depending on the value of `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Logic for Cost Calculation**:
   - If `n > 1`:
     - `ans1` is calculated as the cost if all yogurts are bought individually: `a * n`.
     - `ans2` is calculated as the cost if the yogurts are bought in pairs as much as possible, with any remaining yogurt bought individually: `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
     - The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
   - If `n == 1`:
     - Since there is only one yogurt, the cost is simply `a`.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The logic for `n > 1` ensures that the program considers both the scenario where all yogurts are bought individually and the scenario where yogurts are bought in pairs as much as possible.
   - The calculation for `ans2` correctly handles the case where `n` is odd by adding the cost of an additional yogurt if there is one left over after pairing.
   - The special case for `n == 1` is correctly handled by directly printing `a`.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case (2 yogurts, 5 burles each, 9 burles for 2): `ans1 = 10`, `ans2 = 9`, so the output is 9.
   - For the second test case (3 yogurts, 5 burles each, 9 burles for 2): `ans1 = 15`, `ans2 = 14`, so the output is 14.
   - For the third test case (3 yogurts, 5 burles each, 11 burles for 2): `ans1 = 15`, `ans2 = 15`, so the output is 15.
   - For the fourth test case (4 yogurts, 5 burles each, 11 burles for 2): `ans1 = 20`, `ans2 = 22`, so the output is 20.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly computes the minimum cost for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
