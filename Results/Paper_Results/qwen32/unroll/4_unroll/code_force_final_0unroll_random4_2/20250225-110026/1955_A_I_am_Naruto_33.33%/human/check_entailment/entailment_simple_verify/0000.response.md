Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code, including the annotations and the original assessment.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts, where the cost of one yogurt is `a` burles and the cost of two yogurts in a promotion is `b` burles.

### Code Analysis
Here's the provided code:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)
```

### Annotations
The annotations describe the state of the program before and after key points:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- If `n > 1`, it calculates two possible costs:
  - `ans1`: The cost if all yogurts are bought individually.
  - `ans2`: The cost if yogurts are bought in pairs and possibly one additional yogurt individually.
- If `n == 1`, it simply prints the cost of one yogurt, `a`.

### Original Assessment
The original assessment claims the program is incorrect due to the calculation of `ans2`. The formula `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` is said to be incorrect because it does not properly handle cases where buying an additional yogurt individually is more expensive than buying another pair.

### Evaluation
Let's verify the correctness of `ans2`:
- `b * n // 2` calculates the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible.
- `a * n % 2` calculates the cost of the remaining yogurt if `n` is odd.

This formula is actually correct. Hereâ€™s why:
- When `n` is even, `n % 2` is 0, so `ans2` becomes `b * n // 2`.
- When `n` is odd, `n % 2` is 1, so `ans2` becomes `b * (n // 2) + a`.

Let's check the provided example:
- For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`:
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 11 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 11 + 5 = 16`
  - The minimum cost is `min(15, 16) = 15`, which is correct.

The original assessment incorrectly states that the formula is wrong. The formula correctly calculates the cost when buying yogurts in pairs and possibly one additional yogurt individually.

### Conclusion
The program is correct. The original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
