Reasoning:
The program is designed to handle multiple test cases where it calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts given the individual price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, reading each test case's `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. **Handling `n > 1`**: For each test case, if `n` is greater than 1, it calculates two possible costs:
   - `ans1`: The cost if all yogurts are bought individually, which is `a * n`.
   - `ans2`: The cost if yogurts are bought in pairs where possible, which is `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`. This formula calculates the cost of buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotional price `b` and any remaining single yogurt at the individual price `a`.
3. **Handling `n == 1`**: If `n` is 1, the cost is simply `a` because only one yogurt is needed, and there's no option to buy a pair.
4. **Output**: For each test case, the program prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2` (or just `a` if `n == 1`).

The logic correctly implements the problem's requirements by comparing the cost of buying yogurts individually versus in pairs where possible. The execution summary aligns with this logic and indicates that the function processes each test case appropriately.

Given the problem constraints and the provided logic, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
