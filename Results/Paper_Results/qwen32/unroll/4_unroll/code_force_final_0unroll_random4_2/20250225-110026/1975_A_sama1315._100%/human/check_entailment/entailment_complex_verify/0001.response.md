### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version to ensure the correctness of the original assessment.

1. **Function `func_1(a)`**:
    - **Step-by-Step Explanation**:
        - The function takes an array `a` and calculates its length `n`.
        - It creates a sorted version of the array, `sorted_a`.
        - It concatenates the array with itself to form `concatenated_a`.
        - It then iterates through all possible windows of length `n` in `concatenated_a` to check if any window matches `sorted_a`.
        - If a match is found, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.
    
    - **Logic Validation**:
        - The logic of checking all possible rotations by concatenating the array with itself is correct.
        - The program correctly identifies if any rotation of the array can result in a sorted array.
        - This approach ensures that all possible rotations are considered, as each window of length `n` in `concatenated_a` represents a rotation of the original array.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
    - **Step-by-Step Explanation**:
        - The function reads input from standard input.
        - It parses the number of test cases `t`.
        - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.
        - It calls `func_1(a)` to determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations and stores the result.
        - After processing all test cases, it prints the results.
    
    - **Logic Validation**:
        - The function correctly reads and processes multiple test cases.
        - It correctly calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
        - The results are printed in the correct format.

3. **Verification**:
    - Let's verify the given program against the example provided:
    
    - **First Test Case**:
        - Input: `1 1 4 5 1 4`
        - Sorted version: `1 1 4 4 5`
        - Concatenated version: `1 1 4 5 1 4 1 1 4 5 1 4`
        - Checking all windows of length 6 in the concatenated version does not yield a match with the sorted version.
        - Output: `No`
    
    - **Second Test Case**:
        - Input: `7 9 2 2 3`
        - Sorted version: `2 2 3 7 9`
        - Concatenated version: `7 9 2 2 3 7 9 2 2 3`
        - Checking all windows of length 5 in the concatenated version yields a match with the sorted version (`2 2 3 7 9`).
        - Output: `Yes`
    
    - **Third Test Case**:
        - Input: `1 2 3`
        - Sorted version: `1 2 3`
        - Concatenated version: `1 2 3 1 2 3`
        - Checking all windows of length 3 in the concatenated version yields a match with the sorted version (`1 2 3`).
        - Output: `Yes`

The program correctly handles these test cases, and the logic appears to be sound. It efficiently checks all possible rotations of the array by leveraging the concatenated version of the array.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly determines whether the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the allowed operations.

Final: **True**
