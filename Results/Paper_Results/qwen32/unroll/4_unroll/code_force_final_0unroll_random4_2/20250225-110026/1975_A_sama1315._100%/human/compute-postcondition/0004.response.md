The code snippet `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. The initial value of `idx` is 0, so after the increment, `idx` becomes 1. The other variables (`a`, `data`, `t`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `data` is a list of `n` strings, where each string is the string representation of the corresponding integer in `a`; `idx` is 1; `t` is `a[0]`.**
