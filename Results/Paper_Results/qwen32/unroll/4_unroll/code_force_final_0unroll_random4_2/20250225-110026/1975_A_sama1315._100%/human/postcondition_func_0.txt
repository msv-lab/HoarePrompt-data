The function accepts a list `a` of `n` positive integers where `n` is between 2 and 50 inclusive. It checks if any contiguous subsequence of `a` concatenated with itself contains the sorted version of `a`. The function returns 'Yes' if such a subsequence exists, otherwise it returns 'No'. However, based on the provided code, the function always returns 'No'.
