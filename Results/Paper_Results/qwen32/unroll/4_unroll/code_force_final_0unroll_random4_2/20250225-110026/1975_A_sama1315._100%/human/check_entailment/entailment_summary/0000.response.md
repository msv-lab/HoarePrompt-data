Reasoning: 
The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of prefix-suffix swaps. The key insight is that if the array can be split into two parts such that the second part followed by the first part results in a sorted array, then the answer is "Yes". The function `func_1` attempts to solve this by checking if any contiguous subsequence of the array concatenated with itself contains the sorted version of the array. However, the implementation of `func_1` is flawed because it does not correctly identify the condition for a valid split. The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to determine the result for each test case. Given the flawed logic in `func_1`, the overall program is not correct as it does not accurately determine if the array can be sorted via the described operation.

Correctness: **False**
