### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred based on the scores of three players in chess games, given the constraints. The logic of the program involves checking if the total sum of the scores is even, which is necessary for the scores to be valid since each game results in a total of 2 points being distributed (either 2-0 for a win/loss, or 1-1 for a draw).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. Each test case consists of three integers representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order.

2. **Sum Check**: For each test case, it checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is even. If the sum is odd, it is impossible to have a valid set of games that result in these scores, so the program prints `-1` and moves to the next test case.

3. **Draw Calculation**: If the sum is even, the program calculates the total number of games played, which is `(a + b + c) // 2`. It then calculates the maximum number of games that could have involved the two players with the lower scores, which is `a + b`. The maximum number of draws is the minimum of these two values, `min(x, y)`, where `x` is the total number of games and `y` is the sum of the scores of the two players with the lower scores.

4. **Output**: The program outputs the calculated maximum number of draws for each test case.

### Evaluation:

The logic of the program is sound and correctly implements the problem's requirements. It properly handles the case where the sum of the scores is odd and calculates the maximum number of draws based on the provided constraints.

### Conclusion:

Given the reasoning above, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided test cases.

**Correctness: True**
