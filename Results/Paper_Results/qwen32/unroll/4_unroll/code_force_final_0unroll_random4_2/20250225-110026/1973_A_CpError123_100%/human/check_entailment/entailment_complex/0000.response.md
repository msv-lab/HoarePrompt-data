### Reasoning:

To determine if the program is correct, we need to analyze the logic behind the provided solution and check whether it correctly calculates the maximum number of draws or identifies invalid score combinations.

1. **Sum of Scores Must Be Even**: 
    - The total points awarded in each game are either 2 (for a win-lose scenario) or 2 (for a draw scenario). Hence, the sum of all points (`a + b + c`) must be even. If the sum is odd, it is impossible to achieve those scores through a valid series of games, and the program correctly returns `-1`.

2. **Calculating Maximum Draws**:
    - If the sum of the scores is even, the program calculates `x = (a + b + c) // 2`. This represents the total number of games played because each game contributes 2 points to the total sum.
    - The program also calculates `y = a + b`, which is the sum of the points of the two players with the lower scores.
    - The maximum number of draws is determined by the minimum of `x` and `y`. This is because:
        - The maximum number of draws is limited by the total number of games (`x`), as each draw contributes 1 point to each of the two players involved.
        - The maximum number of draws is also limited by the points of the two players with the lower scores (`y`), as each draw contributes 1 point to each of these players. Thus, the total points of these two players cannot exceed the number of draws.

3. **Edge Cases**:
    - The program correctly handles the edge case where no games are played (`a = b = c = 0`), returning `0` draws.
    - The program correctly identifies invalid score combinations, such as `1 1 1`, where the sum of scores is odd, and returns `-1`.

Given the above analysis, the program follows the correct logic to determine the maximum number of draws or to identify invalid score combinations.

### Correctness: **True**
