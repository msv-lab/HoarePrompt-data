To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the logic step by step:

### Problem Understanding
The goal is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized, where \(p\) is a permutation of \(\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\). We can use up to \(3n\) queries to achieve this. Each query compares the bitwise OR of two pairs of elements from the permutation.

### Program Analysis

1. **Finding the Maximum Element:**
   - The program first identifies the maximum element in the permutation using the `func_1` function. It does this by comparing the bitwise OR of the current maximum element with each other element in the permutation.
   - The logic here is correct. If the OR of the current maximum element with itself is less than the OR of another element with itself, then the other element is larger and becomes the new maximum.
   
2. **Finding the Best Pair:**
   - Once the maximum element is identified, the program tries to find the best pair by comparing the OR of the maximum element with the current best pair element against the OR of the maximum element with each other element.
   - If the OR of the maximum element with the current best pair element is less than the OR of the maximum element with another element, then the other element is a better candidate for the pair.
   - If the ORs are equal, it performs an additional comparison to determine if the new element is indeed a better candidate.
   
3. **Output:**
   - After finding the best pair, the program outputs the indices of the pair.

### Correctness Verification
- **Max Element Identification:** The first loop correctly identifies the maximum element in the permutation using the OR operation.
- **Best Pair Identification:** The second loop correctly identifies the best pair by comparing the OR of the maximum element with each other element. The additional comparison when the ORs are equal ensures that the best pair is found correctly.
- **Query Count:** The program uses at most \(2n\) queries (one for finding the maximum element and one for finding the best pair), which is well within the limit of \(3n\).

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to find the pair of indices such that the XOR of the corresponding elements in the permutation is maximized, using an appropriate number of queries.

Correctness: **True**
