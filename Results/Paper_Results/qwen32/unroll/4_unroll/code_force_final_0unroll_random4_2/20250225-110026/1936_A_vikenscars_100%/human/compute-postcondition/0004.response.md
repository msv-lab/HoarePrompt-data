The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to ensure the loop can execute.

To determine whether the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0. The value of `i` does not affect the execution of the loop directly but will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts.

The states `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted according to the given constraints.

State: **`max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum element in the permutation p, `pair_idx` is equal to max_item_idx, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
