### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the functions `func_1` and `func_2` and see if they collectively solve the problem as described.

#### func_1:
- **Purpose**: To compute a difference between two elements in a list `arr`.
- **Mechanism**: It takes the last element of `arr` and subtracts the element at the index `-times` (or the first element if `times` is 0).
- **Correctness**: The function seems straightforward and correctly computes the difference as intended.

#### func_2:
- **Purpose**: To compute the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.
- **Mechanism**:
  - It first creates a list `pre` of indices where the character is `'>'`.
  - It then computes a cumulative sum of these indices in `preOne`.
  - It initializes an empty list `suffZero` with a single element `0`.
  - It iterates over the string `s1` from right to left.
  - Depending on whether the current character is `'>'` or `'<'`, it computes the number of steps the pinball would take to leave the grid using the precomputed sums in `preOne` and `suffZero`.
  - It updates `preOne` and `suffZero` as it processes each character.
  - Finally, it prints the computed values in `ans`.

- **Correctness**: The logic in `func_2` appears to be complex and relies on the precomputed sums in `preOne` and `suffZero` to efficiently determine the number of steps for each starting position. However, the implementation details need to be carefully verified against the problem requirements.

#### Verification:
- The problem requires the pinball to move according to the direction specified by the character in the cell, and the character to invert after the pinball moves.
- The function `func_2` seems to handle the movement and inversion by maintaining cumulative sums of indices of `'>'` and `'<'` characters and using these sums to compute the number of steps.
- The logic for computing `zeroInd` and `oneInd` appears to be based on the relative positions of `'>'` and `'<'` characters, which is consistent with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to compute the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position. Given the complexity of the problem and the provided solution, the implementation seems to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
