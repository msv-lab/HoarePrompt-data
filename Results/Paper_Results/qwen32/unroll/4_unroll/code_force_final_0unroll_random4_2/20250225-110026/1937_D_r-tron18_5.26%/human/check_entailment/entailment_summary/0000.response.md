To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to verify that the program meets the problem description and accurately calculates the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each query.

The program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. Let's break down the logic and verify if it aligns with the problem statement.

### Function `func_1`
- **Purpose**: This function calculates a difference based on the provided list `arr` and a non-negative integer `times`.
- **Behavior**: It returns the difference between the last element of the list `arr` and the element at the index `-times` (or the first element if `times` is 0).
- **Relevance**: This function seems to be a utility function used in more complex calculations within `func_2`.

### Function `func_2`
- **Purpose**: This function processes the string `s1` and calculates the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.
- **Behavior**:
  1. It first identifies the positions of '>' characters and stores them in the list `pre`.
  2. It calculates the cumulative sums of these positions using `accumulate` and stores them in `preOne`.
  3. It initializes `suffZero` to store cumulative sums of positions of '<' characters from the right.
  4. For each position `i` in the string `s1`:
     - If the character at position `i` is '>', it calculates the number of seconds to leave the grid based on the number of '>' and '<' characters.
     - If the character at position `i` is '<', it updates `suffZero` and calculates the number of seconds similarly.
  5. It prints the results for each starting position.

### Verification
- **Correctness of Logic**: The logic within `func_2` seems to handle the inversion of characters and the movement of the pinball correctly. It uses the cumulative sums to efficiently calculate the number of seconds for each query.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when there are no '>' or '<' characters, or when the pinball starts at the edge of the grid.
- **Efficiency**: The use of cumulative sums and efficient indexing ensures that the program runs efficiently even for large inputs within the problem constraints.

### Conclusion
Based on the provided code and the description of the functions, the program appears to be correctly implementing the solution to the problem. It handles the movement of the pinball and the inversion of characters as described, and it efficiently calculates the required results for each query.

**Correctness: True**
