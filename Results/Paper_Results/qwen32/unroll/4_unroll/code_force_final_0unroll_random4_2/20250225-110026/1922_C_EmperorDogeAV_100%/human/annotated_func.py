#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of lists where each sublist contains n integers representing the coordinates of n cities in ascending order (0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9). n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. Each test case also contains m queries, where m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^5, and each query is a pair of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the cities between which the minimum travel cost is to be calculated (1 <= x_i, y_i <= n, x_i != y_i). The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each city in a test case, the closest city is uniquely determined.

    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)

        back = -99999999999999999999

        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
        
    #State: `prog_cities` is a list where `prog_cities[0]` is the distance between the first and second city, `prog_cities[n-2]` is 1, and for all other indices `i` (1 to n-3), `prog_cities[i]` is either 1 (if the distance to the next city is smaller) or the distance to the next city.
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns `prog_cities`, which is a list where `prog_cities[0]` is the distance between the first and second city, `prog_cities[n-2]` is 1, and for all other indices `i` (1 to n-3), `prog_cities[i]` is either 1 (if the distance to the next city is smaller) or the distance to the next city.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of city coordinates in ascending order and the number of cities `n`. It returns a list `prog_cities` where each element indicates the minimum travel cost to the closest city for each city, except for the last city which is always 1. Specifically, `prog_cities[0]` is the distance between the first and second city, `prog_cities[n-2]` is 1, and for all other indices `i` (1 to n-3), `prog_cities[i]` is either 1 or the distance to the next city, whichever is smaller.
