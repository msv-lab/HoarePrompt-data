The code snippet initializes a list `prog_cities` with `n - 1` zeros. This means that `prog_cities` is a list of length `n - 1` where each element is `0`.

Output State: **`cities` is a list of lists where each sublist contains n integers representing the coordinates of n cities in ascending order (0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9); `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^5, and each query is a pair of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the cities between which the minimum travel cost is to be calculated (1 <= x_i, y_i <= n, x_i != y_i); `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros.**

In simpler terms, the `prog_cities` list has been created with `n - 1` elements, all set to `0`. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
