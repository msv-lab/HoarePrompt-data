Precondition: **cities is a list of lists where each sublist contains n integers representing the coordinates of n cities in ascending order (0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9). n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. Each test case also contains m queries, where m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^5, and each query is a pair of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the cities between which the minimum travel cost is to be calculated (1 <= x_i, y_i <= n, x_i != y_i). The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each city in a test case, the closest city is uniquely determined.**
