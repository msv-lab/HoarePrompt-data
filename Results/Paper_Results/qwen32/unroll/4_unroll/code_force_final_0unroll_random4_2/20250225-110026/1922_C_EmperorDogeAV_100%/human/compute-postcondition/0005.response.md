Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes a list of city coordinates in ascending order and the number of cities `n`. It returns a list `prog_cities` where each element indicates the minimum travel cost to the closest city for each city, except for the last city which is always 1. Specifically, `prog_cities[0]` is the distance between the first and second city, `prog_cities[n-2]` is 1, and for all other indices `i` (1 to n-3), `prog_cities[i]` is either 1 or the distance to the next city, whichever is smaller.**
