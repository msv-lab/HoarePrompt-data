You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

    5 1

Output

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of lists where each sublist contains n integers representing the coordinates of n cities in ascending order (0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9). n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. Each test case also contains m queries, where m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^5, and each query is a pair of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the cities between which the minimum travel cost is to be calculated (1 <= x_i, y_i <= n, x_i != y_i). The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each city in a test case, the closest city is uniquely determined.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of city coordinates in ascending order and the number of cities `n`. It returns a list `prog_cities` where each element indicates the minimum travel cost to the closest city for each city, except for the last city which is always 1. Specifically, `prog_cities[0]` is the distance between the first and second city, `prog_cities[n-2]` is 1, and for all other indices `i` (1 to n-3), `prog_cities[i]` is either 1 or the distance to the next city, whichever is smaller.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
The problem involves determining the minimum number of coins required to travel between two cities on a number line. Cities are given in ascending order, and for each city, there is a uniquely determined closest city. Traveling to the closest city costs 1 coin, while traveling directly to another city costs the distance between them in coins.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the coordinates of these cities, and the number of queries `m`.
   - It splits the city coordinates into a list and converts them to integers.

2. **Closest City Calculation:**
   - The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the cost to travel to the closest city for each city, except the last one in the given direction.
   - The function iterates through the cities and for each city, it checks the distance to the previous and next city.
   - It assigns a cost of 1 if the closest city is the next one, otherwise, it assigns the distance to the closest city.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for the forward and backward costs.
   - `pref_sum_f` stores the cumulative cost to travel to the closest city starting from the first city.
   - `pref_sum_b` stores the cumulative cost to travel to the closest city starting from the last city (in reverse).

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program determines the cost to travel from city `a` to city `b`.
   - If `a < b`, it uses the forward prefix sums to calculate the cost.
   - If `a > b`, it uses the backward prefix sums to calculate the cost.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Function `func_1` Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the cost to travel to the closest city, but it incorrectly calculates the cost for the last city.
   - The function should handle the last city separately, as it does not have a forward neighbor.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are calculated based on the wrong assumption that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the cost for all cities.
   - The prefix sums should be calculated based on the correct costs, which the function `func_1` does not provide.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - The program assumes that the prefix sums correctly represent the cost to travel to the closest city, but this is not the case due to the incorrect implementation of `func_1`.
   - The program does not handle the case where the closest city is not the next city correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the cost to travel to the closest city, and the prefix sums are calculated based on these incorrect costs. As a result, the program does not provide the correct minimum number of coins required to travel between cities.

**Correctness: **False**
