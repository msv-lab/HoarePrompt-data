### Reasoning:

The program's goal is to determine the minimum cost to travel between pairs of cities, where the cost can be either the direct distance between two cities or the accumulated cost of traveling through the closest cities.

Let's break down the program and verify its correctness:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the coordinates of the cities `cities`, and the number of queries `m`.
   - It also reads the queries, which are pairs of cities.

2. **Determine Closest Cities:**
   - The program computes `forward_cities` by calling `func_1` on the list of cities in their original order.
   - It computes `backward_cities` by calling `func_1` on the list of cities in reverse order.
   - `func_1` is supposed to determine, for each city, whether the closest city is the next one (in the given direction) or not, and return a list of costs accordingly.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are prefix sums of `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`, respectively.
   - These prefix sums are used to quickly calculate the accumulated cost to travel through the closest cities from one city to another.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program determines whether to use the forward or backward prefix sums based on the relative order of the cities in the query.
   - It then calculates the cost by subtracting the appropriate prefix sums.

### Analysis of `func_1`:

- **Initialization:**
  - `prog_cities` is initialized as a list of zeros with length `n-1`.

- **Loop through Cities:**
  - For each city `i` (except the last one), the program calculates the distance to the previous city `back` and the next city `forward`.
  - It then checks if the next city is closer than the previous city.
  - If the next city is closer, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1 (indicating that the closest city is the next one and the cost is 1 coin).
  - Otherwise, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to the distance to the next city.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The first city only has a next city, so `back` is set to a very small number.
  - The last city only has a previous city, so `forward` is set to a very large number.

### Issues:

- **Incorrect Indexing:**
  - The loop in `func_1` should iterate from `0` to `n-2` because `prog_cities` has length `n-1`.
  - However, the current loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`, which causes an `IndexError` when `i` is `n-1`.

- **Incorrect Condition:**
  - The condition `if i < n - 1:` is unnecessary because the loop already stops at `n-2`.

- **Incorrect Assignment:**
  - When `i` is `n-2`, the program should set `prog_cities[n-2]` to 1 because the closest city to the second last city is always the last city.

### Corrected `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
        
    # Ensure the last city's closest city is the one before it
    prog_cities[n - 2] = 1
    return prog_cities
```

### Conclusion:

The current implementation of `func_1` has issues with indexing and conditions that need to be corrected. Without these corrections, the program will not function as intended.

**Correctness: **False**
