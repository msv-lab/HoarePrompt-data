To ensure that the for loop executes, we need to focus on the variable `t` which is used in the loop head. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1, as the loop will iterate `t` times. The other variables `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to control the execution of the loop.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Head Analysis**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t)`. This means the loop will execute `t` times.
2. **Condition for Execution**: For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.
3. **Adjustments**: Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` do not affect the execution of the loop and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Given this, the adjusted state before the loop starts should be:

State: **`t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30**
