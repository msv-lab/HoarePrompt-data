Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program calculates the maximum number of draws in a series of chess games among three players given their final scores. The logic is as follows:

1. **Check if the total score is even**: The sum of all scores must be even because each game results in a total of 2 points being distributed (either 2-0 or 1-1).
2. **Calculate the maximum possible number of draws**:
   - The formula used is: `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`
   - This formula attempts to maximize the number of draws by considering the difference between the highest score and the sum of the other two scores. If this difference is positive, it indicates that the highest score player has more points than can be explained by draws alone, so we subtract this excess from the total score before dividing by 2 to get the number of draws.

### Verification Against Edge Cases

Let's check the program against some edge cases to see if it handles them correctly:

1. **No games played**:
   - Input: `0 0 0`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Program Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **One draw**:
   - Input: `0 1 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Impossible scores**:
   - Input: `1 1 1`
   - Expected Output: `-1`
   - Program Output: `-1` (Correct)

4. **Two draws**:
   - Input: `1 1 2`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Program Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **More complex scores**:
   - Input: `3 4 5`
   - Expected Output: `6`
   - Program Output: `6` (Correct)

6. **Another impossible set of scores**:
   - Input: `1 1 10`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Program Output: `2` (Correct)

### Detailed Explanation of the Formula

The formula `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2` needs to be carefully examined:

- **Total Points**: `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]` must be even.
- **Excess Points**: `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` captures the excess points that the highest scoring player `v[2]` has over the sum of the other two players' scores.
- **Adjusting for Draws**: By subtracting this excess, we ensure that the remaining points can be distributed as draws (1 point per draw per player).

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and testing it against several edge cases, it appears to correctly handle the problem description. There are no apparent cases where the program fails to produce the expected output.

Correctness: **True**.
