You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three sorted scores. For each test case, it checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the function outputs '-1'. Otherwise, it calculates and outputs a specific result based on the formula provided. The input scores and the number of test cases remain unchanged after processing.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program calculates the maximum number of draws in a series of chess games among three players given their final scores. The logic is as follows:

1. **Check if the total score is even**: The sum of all scores must be even because each game results in a total of 2 points being distributed (either 2-0 or 1-1).
2. **Calculate the maximum possible number of draws**:
   - The formula used is: `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`
   - This formula attempts to maximize the number of draws by considering the difference between the highest score and the sum of the other two scores. If this difference is positive, it indicates that the highest score player has more points than can be explained by draws alone, so we subtract this excess from the total score before dividing by 2 to get the number of draws.

### Verification Against Edge Cases

Let's check the program against some edge cases to see if it handles them correctly:

1. **No games played**:
   - Input: `0 0 0`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Program Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **One draw**:
   - Input: `0 1 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Impossible scores**:
   - Input: `1 1 1`
   - Expected Output: `-1`
   - Program Output: `-1` (Correct)

4. **Two draws**:
   - Input: `1 1 2`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Program Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **More complex scores**:
   - Input: `3 4 5`
   - Expected Output: `6`
   - Program Output: `6` (Correct)

6. **Another impossible set of scores**:
   - Input: `1 1 10`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Program Output: `2` (Correct)

### Detailed Explanation of the Formula

The formula `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2` needs to be carefully examined:

- **Total Points**: `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]` must be even.
- **Excess Points**: `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` captures the excess points that the highest scoring player `v[2]` has over the sum of the other two players' scores.
- **Adjusting for Draws**: By subtracting this excess, we ensure that the remaining points can be distributed as draws (1 point per draw per player).

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and testing it against several edge cases, it appears to correctly handle the problem description. There are no apparent cases where the program fails to produce the expected output.

Correctness: **True**.
