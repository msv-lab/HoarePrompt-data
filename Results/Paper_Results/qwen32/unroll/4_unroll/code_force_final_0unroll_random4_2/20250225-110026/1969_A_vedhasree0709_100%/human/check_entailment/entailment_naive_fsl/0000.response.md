Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all cases as per the problem description. The code is designed to find pairs of friends who are best friends with each other, and if such a pair is found, it prints `2` as the minimum number of invitations needed. However, if no such pair is found, it incorrectly prints `3` without considering other possible combinations that might require fewer than `3` invitations.

For example, consider the following test case:

```
1
4
2 3 4 1
```

In this case, the best friend relationships form a cycle: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1. The code will not find any pair `i` and `p_i` such that `p[p_i - 1] == i + 1` and will print `3`. However, the correct answer is `2` because Monocarp can invite friends `1` and `2`, and both will come to the party since `1`'s best friend is `2` and `2`'s best friend is `3`, but `2` will come because both `1` and `2` are invited.

Another example:

```
1
4
3 4 1 2
```

Here, the best friend relationships are: 1 -> 3, 2 -> 4, 3 -> 1, 4 -> 2. The code will not find any pair `i` and `p_i` such that `p[p_i - 1] == i + 1` and will print `3`. However, the correct answer is `2` because Monocarp can invite friends `1` and `3`, and both will come to the party since `1`'s best friend is `3` and `3`'s best friend is `1`.

Thus, the code is incorrect for these cases and potentially others.
