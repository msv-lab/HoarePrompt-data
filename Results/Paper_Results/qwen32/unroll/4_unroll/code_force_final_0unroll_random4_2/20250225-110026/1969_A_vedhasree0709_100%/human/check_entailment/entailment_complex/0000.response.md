### Reasoning:

The function is designed to determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to ensure at least two friends attend the party. Here is a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The function iterates through each friend `i` and checks if there is a cycle of length 2 in the permutation `p`. Specifically, it checks if the best friend of friend `i` (`p[i]`) has `i` as their best friend (`p[p[i]-1] == i+1`).
   - If such a cycle is found, it means that sending invitations to these two friends will ensure both of them attend the party. Hence, it prints `2`.
   
2. **Fallback to 3 Invitations**:
   - If no such cycle is found after checking all friends, the function concludes that it needs to send invitations to at least 3 friends to ensure at least two attend. This is because in the worst case, no two friends are each other's best friend, and thus, inviting two friends might not be sufficient to ensure both attend.

### Analysis:

- **Cycle of Length 2**:
  - If there is a cycle of length 2, it means that two friends are each other's best friends. Inviting both of them guarantees that both will attend, which is optimal with a minimum of 2 invitations.
  
- **No Cycle of Length 2**:
  - If no such cycle exists, the function defaults to sending invitations to 3 friends. This is a conservative approach, as it ensures that at least two friends will come, even if no two friends are each other's best friend.

### Conclusion:

The function correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of invitations needed based on the presence of cycles in the permutation. It handles both scenarios (cycle of length 2 and no such cycle) appropriately.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
