### Reasoning:
The provided Python program aims to solve the problem by determining the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to ensure that at least 2 friends attend the party. The logic is based on the observation that if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (a cycle of length 2 in the permutation), Monocarp only needs to invite these two friends. If no such pair exists, he needs to invite three friends to ensure at least two come.

Let's break down the program's logic:

1. **Cycle of Length 2 Check**:
   - The program iterates through each friend `i` and checks if `l[p[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1`. This condition checks if `i` and `p[i]` are each other's best friends (i.e., a cycle of length 2 exists).
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop.

2. **No Cycle of Length 2**:
   - If no such pair is found after checking all friends, it prints `3`.

The program's logic is correct based on the problem description. If there is a cycle of length 2, only two invitations are needed. If there is no such cycle, the program assumes that inviting three friends is necessary to ensure at least two come to the party. This assumption holds because, in the worst case, inviting three friends can ensure that at least two pairs of friends (each pair being best friends) are covered.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of invitations needed based on the presence or absence of cycles of length 2 in the permutation defined by the list `p`.
