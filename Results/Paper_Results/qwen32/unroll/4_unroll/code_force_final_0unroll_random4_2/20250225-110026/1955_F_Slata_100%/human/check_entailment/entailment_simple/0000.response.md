### Reasoning:

To determine the maximum number of times Bob can win, we need to understand the conditions under which Bob wins. Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. The XOR operation has the following properties:

- XOR of a number with itself is 0 (e.g., 1 ^ 1 = 0, 2 ^ 2 = 0).
- XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself (e.g., 1 ^ 0 = 1).
- XOR is commutative and associative, which means the order of operations does not matter.

Given the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, we need to consider their XOR properties:
- 1 ^ 1 = 0
- 2 ^ 2 = 0
- 3 ^ 3 = 0
- 4 ^ 4 = 0
- 1 ^ 3 = 2
- 1 ^ 2 = 3
- 1 ^ 4 = 5 (which is 1 in 4-bit representation)
- 2 ^ 3 = 1
- 2 ^ 4 = 6 (which is 2 in 4-bit representation)
- 3 ^ 4 = 7 (which is 3 in 4-bit representation)

For Bob to win, the XOR of the remaining numbers must be zero. This can be achieved by removing numbers in such a way that pairs of identical numbers are left, or by ensuring that the remaining numbers XOR to zero.

The strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins involves removing numbers in a way that leaves Bob with sequences where the XOR is zero. Hereâ€™s how the given program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win:

- `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2`: This part calculates the number of pairs of each number that can be removed, leaving Bob with sequences where the XOR is zero.
- `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`: This part checks if there is an odd number of each of the numbers (1, 2, 3) left after removing pairs. If there is exactly one of each (which means `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3`), then the XOR of these three numbers is zero (since 1 ^ 2 ^ 3 = 0), and Bob wins one more time.

Let's verify this with the examples provided:

1. **Input:** `1 1 1 0`
   - Pairs: `1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 0 // 2 = 0`
   - Extra odd numbers: `1 % 2 + 1 % 2 + 1 % 2 == 3` is True, so `int(True) = 1`
   - Output: `0 + 1 = 1`

2. **Input:** `1 0 1 2`
   - Pairs: `1 // 2 + 0 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 2 // 2 = 1`
   - Extra odd numbers: `1 % 2 + 0 % 2 + 1 % 2 == 3` is False, so `int(False) = 0`
   - Output: `1 + 0 = 1`

3. **Input:** `2 2 2 0`
   - Pairs: `2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 = 3`
   - Extra odd numbers: `2 % 2 + 2 % 2 + 2 % 2 == 3` is False, so `int(False) = 0`
   - Output: `3 + 0 = 3`

4. **Input:** `3 3 2 0`
   - Pairs: `3 // 2 + 3 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 = 3`
   - Extra odd numbers: `3 % 2 + 3 % 2 + 2 % 2 == 3` is True, so `int(True) = 1`
   - Output: `3 + 1 = 4` (This seems incorrect based on the provided output; it should be 3)

5. **Input:** `0 9 9 9`
   - Pairs: `0 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 = 13`
   - Extra odd numbers: `0 % 2 + 9 % 2 + 9 % 2 == 3` is True, so `int(True) = 1`
   - Output: `13 + 1 = 14` (This seems incorrect based on the provided output; it should be 12)

Upon reviewing, there seems to be a discrepancy in the fourth and fifth examples. The program's logic appears correct based on the general strategy, but the specific outputs do not match the provided examples.

### Correctness:
Given the discrepancies in the fourth and fifth examples, the correctness of the program as provided is questionable.

**Correctness: False**
