Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `predicate` is a function that takes an element from `arr` and returns a boolean value, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `arr`.**

Explanation: The variables `l` and `r` have been assigned specific values. `l` is set to 0, and `r` is set to the length of the list `arr`. The other variables (`arr` and `predicate`) remain unchanged in terms of their definitions and properties.
