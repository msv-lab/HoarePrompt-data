Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the problem correctly. The task is to rearrange the elements of the array to maximize the beauty, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n. The given program sorts the array and prints it, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty. To maximize the beauty, the array should be rearranged such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This can be achieved by arranging the array in an alternating pattern of minimum and maximum values, or simply by sorting the array in ascending or descending order, as the maximum beauty is achieved when the array is either sorted in ascending or descending order. The program should calculate and print the beauty of the sorted array, not just the sorted array itself.
