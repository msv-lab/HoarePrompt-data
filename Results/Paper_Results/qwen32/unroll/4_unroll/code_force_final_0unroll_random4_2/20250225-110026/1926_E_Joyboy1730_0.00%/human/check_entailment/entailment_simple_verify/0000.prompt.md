You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        L = []
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
        tot = 0
        pow = 1
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
                break
            tot += a
            k -= tot
            pow *= 2



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.

                break
            tot += a
            k -= tot
            pow *= 2
        
    #State: No output produced for any test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **List `L` is never populated**: The list `L` is initialized as an empty list and never populated with any values. This means that the loop `for a in L:` will never execute, and the program will not print any results.

2. **Incorrect logic for determining the k-th card**: The program is supposed to lay down cards in a specific order based on the rules provided, but it does not do so. Instead, it attempts to use the list `L` to determine the k-th card, which is not populated.

3. **Incorrect calculation of the k-th card**: The calculation `print(pow * (2 * k - 1))` does not correctly determine the k-th card based on the rules provided in the problem statement.

To illustrate the issue, let's consider the first test case from the problem description:

**Input:**
```
1
7 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

The program will not produce this output because it does not correctly implement the logic to lay down the cards in the specified order and determine the k-th card.

Here is a corrected version of the program that follows the problem description:

```python
def find_kth_card(n, k):
    odd_count = (n + 1) // 2
    if k <= odd_count:
        return 2 * k - 1
    k -= odd_count
    
    multiplier = 2
    while k > 0:
        current_count = (n // multiplier + 1) // 2
        if k <= current_count:
            return multiplier * (2 * k - 1)
        k -= current_count
        multiplier += 1

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(find_kth_card(n, k))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version correctly lays down the cards in the specified order and determines the k-th card based on the rules provided.
