In the provided loop, the loop head contains the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The variables `n` and `k` are mentioned in the context but are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted according to the task requirements. 

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `t` is at least 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in Python to indicate that the loop variable is not used in the loop body, so we don't need to adjust its state.

Given the constraints, `t` is already provided and is in the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, which means the loop will execute as long as `t` is within this range.

State: **`t` is an integer provided by the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4**
