### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies the flaws in the provided program. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Objective and Strategy**:
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX of the final array `c`.
   - Bob aims to minimize the MEX of the final array `c`.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If an integer `i` appears an odd number of times in `a`, Alice can ensure that `i` ends up in `c` by picking it an odd number of times.
   - If an integer `i` appears an even number of times, Alice cannot force `i` into `c` because Bob can always remove the last occurrence of `i`.

3. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
   - Based on the optimal play strategy, the MEX should be the smallest integer that is not covered by the integers that Alice can force into `c` (those with odd occurrences).

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The provided program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in the array `a`.
   - It then iterates through the integers from `0` to `n` and checks:
     - If an integer `i` is not present in the array, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
     - If an integer `i` is present exactly once and it's the first such integer, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
     - If an integer `i` is present exactly once but it's not the first such integer, it does nothing and continues.
   - This logic does not correctly determine the MEX based on the optimal play strategy. The program does not account for the fact that Alice can only force integers with odd occurrences into `c`.

5. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotations describe the program's behavior, which aligns with the original assessment. The program identifies and prints the smallest integer `i` (where `0 ≤ i ≤ n`) that either does not appear in the array or appears exactly once, ensuring that if multiple such numbers exist, the smallest one is chosen.
   - However, this does not align with the optimal strategy where Alice can only force integers with odd occurrences into `c`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the MEX based on the optimal play strategy. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
