### Reasoning:

The program's goal is to determine the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and how it relates to the problem:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`.

3. **Finding MEX:**
   - It iterates through the numbers from `0` to `n` and checks each number `i`:
     - If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp` (i.e., `i` does not appear in `arr`), it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.
     - If `i` appears exactly once in `arr` and `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.
     - If `i` appears exactly once in `arr` and `first` is `False`, it sets `first` to `True`.

### Analysis:

- The program correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer that either does not appear in `arr` or appears exactly once. This is because:
  - The loop iterates through numbers from `0` to `n`, ensuring that the smallest number is found first.
  - The `first` flag ensures that if there are multiple numbers that appear exactly once, the smallest one is chosen.
  
- The program does not account for the turns of Alice and Bob, but the optimal strategy for both players leads to the same result in terms of the MEX of `c`. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it. However, the MEX is determined by the presence or absence of numbers in `c`, and the optimal strategy ensures that the smallest missing number is identified correctly.

### Conclusion:

Given the problem constraints and the logic of the program, the program correctly identifies the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends, assuming both players play optimally.
