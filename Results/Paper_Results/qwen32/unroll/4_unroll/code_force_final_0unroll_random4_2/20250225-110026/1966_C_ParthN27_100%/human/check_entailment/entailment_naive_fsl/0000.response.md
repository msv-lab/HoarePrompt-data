Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:

The provided program attempts to determine the winner of the game by using a strategy based on the sorted unique values of the piles. However, this approach does not correctly implement the game's logic for all cases. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the Nim-sum (XOR-sum) strategy, which is the optimal way to determine the winner in this type of game.

#### Key Issues:

1. **XOR Sum Strategy**: The game described is a variant of the Nim game, and the winner can be determined using the XOR-sum of the pile sizes. If the XOR-sum of all pile sizes is zero at the start of a player's turn, that player is in a losing position if the opponent plays optimally. Otherwise, they are in a winning position.

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The provided code uses a different logic based on the sorted unique values and their differences, which does not correctly reflect the game's rules. For example, the code checks if the difference between consecutive unique pile sizes is greater than 1, which is not a correct indicator of the game's outcome.

#### Counterexample:

Consider the following test case:

```
1
3
1 1 2
```

- **XOR Sum Calculation**: The XOR-sum of the piles is `1 ^ 1 ^ 2 = 0`. Since the XOR-sum is zero, Alice (the first player) is in a losing position if both play optimally.

- **Program Output**: The program will output "Alice" for this case, which is incorrect. The correct output should be "Bob".

#### Correct Approach:

To correctly determine the winner, the program should compute the XOR-sum of the pile sizes and determine the winner based on whether the XOR-sum is zero or not.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        xor_sum = 0
        for a in arr:
            xor_sum ^= a
        if xor_sum == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected program correctly implements the XOR-sum strategy and will output the correct winner for all valid test cases.
