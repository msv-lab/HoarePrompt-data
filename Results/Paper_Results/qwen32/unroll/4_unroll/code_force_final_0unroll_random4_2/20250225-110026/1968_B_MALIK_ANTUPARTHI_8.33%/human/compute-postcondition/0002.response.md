Let's analyze the provided loop and understand how the state changes with each iteration.

The loop iterates `a` times, and in each iteration, it performs the following steps:
1. Reads two integers `b` and `c`.
2. Reads two strings `d` and `e`.
3. Initializes `k` to 0.
4. Iterates through the string `d` up to index `b-1`:
   - Checks if the character `d[j]` is in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`.
   - If found, updates `k` to the index of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1.
   - If `k` becomes equal to `c` or `j` is the last index of `d`, updates `k` to `j + 1` and breaks the loop.
   - If not found, updates `k` to `j` and breaks the loop.
5. Prints the value of `k`.

The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` are not affected by the loop. The variable `a` determines the number of iterations, and `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` are read anew in each iteration.

After all iterations, the output state will be:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged as it only determines the number of iterations.
- `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` will be the values from the last iteration of the loop, but since they are read anew in each iteration, they do not retain their values across iterations.

The output state is described by the final printed values of `k` for each iteration, but since we are asked to describe the state of the variables after the loop, we focus on the variables themselves.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10^5; a is the integer value provided by the user input; b, c, d, and e are the values from the last iteration of the loop.**
