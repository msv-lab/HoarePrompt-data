You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            low, high = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)
            cur = low
            while high >= cur:
                if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                    print(p1 - cur + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    cur += 1
            else:
                print(p3)
        
    #State: The output state consists of `t` lines, each corresponding to the result of each iteration of the loop. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are updated with the values provided in each iteration's input. The output for each iteration is determined by the conditions specified in the loop: if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, it prints `-1`. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, it prints `p1 + p2`. Otherwise, it finds the maximum value that can be achieved under the given constraints and prints it. The state of other variables not involved in the loop remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, it accepts three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30. The function returns the result for each test case based on the values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
