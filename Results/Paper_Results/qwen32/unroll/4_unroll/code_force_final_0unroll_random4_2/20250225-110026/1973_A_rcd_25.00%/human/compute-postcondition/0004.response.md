Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. It outputs `-1` if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. Otherwise, it calculates and outputs the maximum possible value under the constraints given, which could be `p1 + p2` if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, or a value derived from the conditions specified in the loop for other cases.**
