### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description, code, and function summary. We will analyze the logic and check if the program correctly handles all cases.

1. **Input Parsing and Sum Check**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the scores for each test case.
   - It checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. This is correct because each game results in a total of 2 points, so the sum of scores must be even.

2. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the program prints `p1 + p2`. This is correct because the maximum number of draws occurs when the player with the highest score (`p3`) has played all games against the other two players and won all of them. The remaining points (`p1 + p2`) must come from draws between the other two players.
   - **Case 2**: If `p3 < p1 + p2`, the program enters a loop to find the maximum number of draws. It initializes `low` and `high` to represent the minimum and maximum possible differences between `p3` and the other scores. It then iterates from `low` to `high` to find a valid configuration where the scores can be achieved.

3. **Inner Loop**:
   - The loop checks if `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`. This condition ensures that the remaining points for `p1` and `p2` after accounting for the draws can be achieved through a combination of wins and draws.
   - If the condition is satisfied, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` which represents the maximum number of draws.
   - If no valid configuration is found after the loop, it prints `p3` as a fallback. This part of the logic is incorrect. If no valid configuration is found, the program should print `-1` instead of `p3`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Fallback Print Statement**: The `else` block after the `while` loop, which prints `p3`, is incorrect. If the loop completes without finding a valid configuration, it should print `-1` instead of `p3`. The fallback print statement can lead to incorrect results in some cases.

### Correctness:
The original assessment correctly identifies the issue with the fallback print statement. The program needs to be corrected to print `-1` if no valid configuration is found after the loop.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the issue identified in the original assessment, the program is not fully correct.

Final: **False**
