Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Input Parsing**: The program first reads the number of test cases, `t`. For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` which represent the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order.

2. **Sum of Scores Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. This is because each game results in a total of 2 points being awarded (either 2 to the winner or 1 to each player in the case of a draw). If the sum is odd, it is impossible to have reached those scores through a series of games, and the program correctly outputs `-1`.

3. **Case Analysis**:
    - **Case 1**: If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the program prints `p1 + p2`. This is because the maximum number of draws occurs when the player with the highest score (`p3`) has played all games against the other two players and won all of them. The remaining points (`p1 + p2`) must come from draws between the other two players.
    - **Case 2**: If `p3 < p1 + p2`, the program enters a loop to find the maximum number of draws. It initializes `low` and `high` to represent the minimum and maximum possible differences between `p3` and the other scores. It then iterates from `low` to `high` to find a valid configuration where the scores can be achieved.

4. **Inner Loop**:
    - The loop checks if `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`. This condition ensures that the remaining points for `p1` and `p2` after accounting for the draws can be achieved through a combination of wins and draws.
    - If the condition is satisfied, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` which represents the maximum number of draws.
    - If no valid configuration is found after the loop, it prints `p3` as a fallback, but this part of the logic seems incorrect and unnecessary.

### Issues in the Program

- **Fallback Print Statement**: The `else` block after the `while` loop, which prints `p3`, is incorrect. If the loop completes without finding a valid configuration, it should print `-1` instead of `p3`. The fallback print statement can lead to incorrect results in some cases.

### Conclusion

The program has a logical flaw in the fallback print statement after the `while` loop. This needs to be corrected for the program to be considered fully correct.

Correctness: **False**
