Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape drawn on the grid is a square or a triangle. The program only checks if the counts of '1's in the first two rows are equal and prints the list of counts in such cases. However, this check is not sufficient to determine the shape of the figure formed by '1's on the grid.

To correctly determine the shape, the program should:
1. Identify the rows that contain '1's.
2. Check if these rows form a square or a triangle based on the criteria provided in the problem description.

For a square, all rows with '1's should have the same number of '1's, and these '1's should be centered in the same way across all rows.
For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row should follow the pattern of 1, 3, 5, ... or its reverse, and the '1's should be centered in the same column.

The provided program does not perform these checks and therefore does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
