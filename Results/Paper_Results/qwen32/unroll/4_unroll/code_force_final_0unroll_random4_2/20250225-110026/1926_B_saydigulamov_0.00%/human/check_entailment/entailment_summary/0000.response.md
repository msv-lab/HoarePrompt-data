Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a triangle or a square. The program only checks if the number of '1's in the first two rows are equal and prints the counts if they are. This check is insufficient to determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle based on the problem's criteria.

For a square, the number of '1's should be the same in every row, and the '1's should be positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

For a triangle, the number of '1's should increase by 2 for each subsequent row (forming a pattern of 1, 3, 5, ... for a regular triangle or 5, 3, 1, ... for an upside-down triangle), and the '1's should be centered in the grid.

The current program does not implement these checks and does not output "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required by the problem statement. Instead, it prints the counts of '1's in the rows when the first two counts are equal, which is not the correct behavior.

Correctness: **False**
