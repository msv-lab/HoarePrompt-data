Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether the drawn shape is a square or a triangle. The program only checks if the first two rows with '1's have the same number of '1's, which is not sufficient to distinguish between a square and a triangle. Additionally, the program does not handle the logic to check for the conditions of a triangle or a square as described in the problem statement.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to:
1. Identify the rows that contain '1's.
2. Check if the shape formed by the '1's matches the conditions for a square or a triangle.
3. Print "SQUARE" if the shape is a square and "TRIANGLE" otherwise.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_square(grid, n):
    k = None
    for row in grid:
        count = row.count('1')
        if count > 0:
            if k is None:
                k = count
            elif count != k:
                return False
    return k > 1

def is_triangle(grid, n):
    k = None
    for i, row in enumerate(grid):
        count = row.count('1')
        if count > 0:
            if k is None:
                k = count
                if k != 2 * i + 1:
                    return False
            else:
                if count != 2 * i + 1:
                    return False
    return k > 1

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
        if is_square(grid, n):
            print("SQUARE")
        elif is_triangle(grid, n) or is_triangle(grid[::-1], n):
            print("TRIANGLE")
        else:
            print("UNKNOWN")  # This line should not be reached based on the problem statement

func()
```

This program correctly checks for the conditions of a square and a triangle, including upside-down triangles.
