Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of '0's and '1's. For each test case, it counts the number of '1's in each row and checks if the first two counts are equal. If they are, it prints the list of counts. The function does not explicitly return a value but prints the counts for test cases where the first two counts of '1's in the rows are equal.**
