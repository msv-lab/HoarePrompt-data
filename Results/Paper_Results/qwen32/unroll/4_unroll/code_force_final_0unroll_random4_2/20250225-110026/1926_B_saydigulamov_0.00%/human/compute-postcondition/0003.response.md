Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the size of the grid, followed by `n` lines of strings, each containing `n` characters that are either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square formed by '1's, with the size of the shape being greater than 1. The function returns the type of shape ('triangle' or 'square') found in each grid.**
