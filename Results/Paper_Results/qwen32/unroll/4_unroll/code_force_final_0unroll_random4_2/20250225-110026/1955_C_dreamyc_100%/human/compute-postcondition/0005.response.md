The code snippet provided initializes a variable `s_a` to 0. None of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `nums`, `a`, `b`, `ans`) are affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. Additionally, `k` is less than the sum of the integers in `nums`. `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, and `b` is `k // 2`. `ans` is 0. `s_a` is 0.**
