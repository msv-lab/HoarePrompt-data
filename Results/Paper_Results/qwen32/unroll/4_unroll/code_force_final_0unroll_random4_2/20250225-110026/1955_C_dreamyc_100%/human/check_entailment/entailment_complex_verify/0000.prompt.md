You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, and nums is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. Additionally, `k` is less than the sum of the integers in `nums`.

    return ans
    #The program returns the count of iterations where `s_a` is less than or equal to `a` and `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list of `n` integers `nums`. It returns `n` if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in `nums`. Otherwise, it returns the count of iterations where the cumulative sum of elements from the start (`s_a`) is less than or equal to `a` (which is `math.ceil(k / 2)`) and the cumulative sum of elements from the end (`s_b`) is less than or equal to `b` (which is `k // 2`).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attack pattern and does not accurately determine the number of ships sunk. Let's analyze why:

The function `func_1` attempts to determine the number of ships sunk by calculating the cumulative durability from both ends (start and end) and comparing it to half of the total attacks `k`. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the alternating attack pattern of the Kraken and does not account for the fact that once a ship sinks, it is no longer attacked.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3 5
1 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Correctness:**
1. Attack 1: Kraken attacks the first ship (durability becomes 0), ships = [2, 1].
2. Attack 2: Kraken attacks the last ship (durability becomes 0), ships = [2].
3. Attack 3: Kraken attacks the first ship (durability becomes 1), ships = [1].
4. Attack 4: Kraken attacks the last ship (durability becomes 0), ships = [].
5. Attack 5: No ships left to attack.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
The program might output `3` because it incorrectly calculates the cumulative durability and does not properly account for the alternating pattern of attacks and sinking ships.

To correctly simulate the Kraken's attack, the program should iteratively attack the first and last ships, decrement their durability, and remove them from consideration once they sink. This requires a more detailed simulation rather than the current approach of summing cumulative durability and comparing to `k`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    nums = deque(nums)
    sunk = 0
    
    while k > 0 and nums:
        # Attack the first ship
        if nums[0] > 0:
            nums[0] -= 1
            if nums[0] == 0:
                nums.popleft()
                sunk += 1
        k -= 1
        
        if k > 0 and nums:
            # Attack the last ship
            if nums[-1] > 0:
                nums[-1] -= 1
                if nums[-1] == 0:
                    nums.pop()
                    sunk += 1
            k -= 1
    
    print(sunk)
```

This corrected version uses a deque to efficiently remove ships from both ends and correctly simulates the Kraken's attack pattern.
