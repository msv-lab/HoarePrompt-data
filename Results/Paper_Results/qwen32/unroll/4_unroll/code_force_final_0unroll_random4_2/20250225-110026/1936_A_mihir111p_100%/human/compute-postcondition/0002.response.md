Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four integer parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, each within the range from 0 to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of a secret permutation `p`. The function uses these parameters to make a query that compares the bitwise OR of the elements at positions `a` and `b` with the bitwise OR of the elements at positions `c` and `d` in the permutation `p`. The function returns the value provided by the user input as a result of this query.**
