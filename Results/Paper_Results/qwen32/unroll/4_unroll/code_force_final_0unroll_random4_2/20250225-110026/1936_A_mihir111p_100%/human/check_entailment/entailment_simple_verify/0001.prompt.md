You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap
We need to find two indices `i` and `j` in the permutation `p` such that the value of `p[i] ⊕ p[j]` is maximized, using at most `3n` queries. Each query allows us to compare the bitwise OR of two pairs of elements in `p`.

### Program Analysis
1. **Initialization:**
   - The program iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n`.
   - It initializes `ans1` to `0`. This variable will eventually hold one of the indices that, when XORed with another index, gives the maximum possible XOR value.

2. **Finding `ans1`:**
   - The program iterates through all indices `i` from `1` to `n-1`.
   - For each index `i`, it performs a query with `func_1(ans1, ans1, i, i)`. This query compares `(p[ans1] | p[ans1])` with `(p[i] | p[i])`, which simplifies to comparing `p[ans1]` with `p[i]` because `x | x = x`.
   - If the result of the query is `<`, it means `p[i]` is greater than `p[ans1]`, so `ans1` is updated to `i`. This process ensures that `ans1` ends up being the index of the maximum element in the permutation.

3. **Finding the Maximum XOR Pair:**
   - The program initializes `mx` to `0` and `v` to `[0]`. `mx` will store the index of an element that, when XORed with `p[ans1]`, results in a high XOR value. `v` will store all indices that give the same high XOR value as `mx`.
   - The program iterates through all indices `i` from `1` to `n-1`.
   - For each index `i`, it performs a query with `func_1(mx, ans1, i, ans1)`. This query compares `(p[mx] | p[ans1])` with `(p[i] | p[ans1])`.
   - If the result of the query is `<`, it means `(p[i] | p[ans1])` is greater than `(p[mx] | p[ans1])`, so `mx` is updated to `i`, and `v` is reset to `[i]`.
   - If the result of the query is `=`, it means `(p[i] | p[ans1])` is equal to `(p[mx] | p[ans1])`, so `i` is added to `v`.
   - After this loop, `v` contains all indices that, when XORed with `p[ans1]`, give the same high XOR value.

4. **Finding the Best Pair in `v`:**
   - The program initializes `mx` to `v[0]` and `ans` to `v[0]`.
   - It iterates through all elements in `v` starting from the second element.
   - For each element `i` in `v`, it performs a query with `func_1(ans, ans, v[i], v[i])`. This query compares `(p[ans] | p[ans])` with `(p[v[i]] | p[v[i]])`, which simplifies to comparing `p[ans]` with `p[v[i]]`.
   - If the result of the query is `>`, it means `p[ans]` is greater than `p[v[i]]`, so `ans` is updated to `v[i]`. This process ensures that `ans` ends up being the index of the maximum element in `v`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints `! ans ans1`, which are the indices that give the maximum XOR value.

### Flushing Output
- After each query and after the final answer, the program should flush the output to ensure it is sent to the judge. The provided code includes a call to `stdout.flush()` inside the `func_1` function, which is correct.

### Conclusion
The program correctly identifies the indices that give the maximum XOR value using at most `3n` queries. It finds the maximum element in the permutation, then finds the element that, when XORed with the maximum element, gives the highest possible XOR value. Finally, it ensures that the output is flushed after each query and the final answer.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
