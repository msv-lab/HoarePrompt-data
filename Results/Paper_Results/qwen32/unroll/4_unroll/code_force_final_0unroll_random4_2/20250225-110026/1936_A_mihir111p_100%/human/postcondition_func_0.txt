The function `func_1` takes four integer parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` and prints a query to compare the bitwise OR of the elements at positions `a` and `b` with the bitwise OR of the elements at positions `c` and `d` in a secret permutation `p`. It then returns the value provided by the user input as a result of this query.
