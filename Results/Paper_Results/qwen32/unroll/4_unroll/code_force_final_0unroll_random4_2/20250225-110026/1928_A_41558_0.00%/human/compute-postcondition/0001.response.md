The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variables `t`, `a`, and `b` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts, so we do not need to set it before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `n` must be greater than 0**
