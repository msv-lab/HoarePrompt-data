Reasoning:  
Let's analyze the program and the conditions it checks to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

The key points to check are:
1. If both dimensions `a` and `b` are odd, it is impossible to form another rectangle, as cutting will result in odd-dimensional pieces that cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle. This is correctly handled by the condition `a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0`.

2. If one dimension is exactly twice the other (i.e., `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`), it is also impossible to form another rectangle, as the resulting pieces will be of dimensions that can only form the same rectangle (rotated or not). This is correctly handled by the condition `a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a`.

3. For all other cases, it should be possible to form a new rectangle, which is correctly handled by the `else` clause.

The execution summary indicates that the function correctly implements these checks and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions.

However, there is a subtle issue with the condition `a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a`. The division operator `/` in Python performs floating-point division, so the result will not be an integer even if `a` is exactly twice `b` (or vice versa). Instead, the condition should use integer division `//` to check if one dimension is exactly twice the other.

The correct condition should be `a // 2 == b or b // 2 == a`.

Given the provided code, it will not correctly handle cases where one dimension is exactly twice the other because of the use of floating-point division. Therefore, the program is not entirely correct.

Correctness: **False**
