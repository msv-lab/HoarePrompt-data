Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program simply outputs `k - 1` for every test case, regardless of the input values of `n`, `k`, or the list of card numbers. The correct solution involves analyzing the frequency of each card number and determining how many cards can remain after performing the allowed operations optimally. The program should calculate the minimum number of cards that cannot be reduced further by the operations described in the problem statement.

Given the execution summary, the program's behavior is consistent with the code provided, but this behavior is incorrect for the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
