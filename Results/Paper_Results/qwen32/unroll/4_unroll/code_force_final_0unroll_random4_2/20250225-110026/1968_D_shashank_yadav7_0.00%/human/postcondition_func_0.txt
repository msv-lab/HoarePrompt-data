The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, along with two lists `p` and `a`. For each test case, it calculates two sums based on the values in `a` and the indices in `p`, adjusted by `k`. It then compares these sums and prints 'Bodya' if the first sum is greater, 'Sasha' if the second sum is greater, or 'Draw' if they are equal. The function does not modify the input values but outputs a result for each test case.
