Output State: **For each testcase, the output will be either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the comparison of `bm` and `sm` after the loop completes. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `p`, and `a` will remain unchanged from their input values, but `bm` and `sm` will be the final sums calculated in the loop.**
