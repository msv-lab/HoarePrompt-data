The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `i` is the loop counter and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts, as it is initialized by the `range` function.

Given that `t` is an integer read from input such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, the loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. Therefore, no specific adjustment is needed for `i` since it is managed by the `range` function. The only requirement is that `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is at least 1**
