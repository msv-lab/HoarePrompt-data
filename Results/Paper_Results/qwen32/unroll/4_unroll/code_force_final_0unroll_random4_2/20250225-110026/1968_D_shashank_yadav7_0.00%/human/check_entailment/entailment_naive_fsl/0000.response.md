Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains several issues that violate the problem description and do not handle the game mechanics correctly. Here are the key problems:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores**:
   - The scores are being updated incorrectly. The program attempts to use a `max` function inappropriately:
     ```python
     bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
     sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
     ```
     This logic does not make sense in the context of the game. The scores should simply be incremented by the value at the current position.

2. **Incorrect Loop and Condition**:
   - The loop runs `n` times, which is incorrect. It should run `k` times since the game lasts `k` turns.
   - The condition `if k == 0: break` is redundant because the loop should naturally terminate after `k` iterations.

3. **Incorrect Index Handling**:
   - The program subtracts 1 from the starting positions `b` and `s` to convert them to 0-based indexing. However, the positions in the permutation array `p` should be used directly without adjustment, as they are already 1-based indices.

4. **Incorrect Score Initialization**:
   - The initial scores `bm` and `sm` are set to `a[b] * k` and `a[s] * k`, which is incorrect. The scores should start at `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively and then be incremented by the values at the subsequent positions.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1  # Convert to 0-based index
        s -= 1  # Convert to 0-based index
        bm = a[b]
        sm = a[s]
        for _ in range(k - 1):  # Run k-1 times because we already counted the initial position
            b = p[b] - 1  # Convert back to 1-based index and then to 0-based
            s = p[s] - 1  # Convert back to 1-based index and then to 0-based
            bm += a[b]
            sm += a[s]
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the scores are calculated correctly by iterating exactly `k` times and using the permutation array `p` correctly to determine the next positions.
