Functionality: **The function takes two binary strings `a` and `b`, and two non-negative integers `i` and `j` as input. It returns the sum of `j` and the index of the first occurrence of the character `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]` if `a[i]` is found in `b[j:]`. If `a[i]` is not found, it returns -1.**
