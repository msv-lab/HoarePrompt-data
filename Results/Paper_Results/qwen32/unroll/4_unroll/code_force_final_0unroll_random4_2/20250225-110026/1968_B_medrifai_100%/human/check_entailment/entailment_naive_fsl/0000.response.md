Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum possible number \( k \) such that a prefix of string \( a \) of length \( k \) is a subsequence of string \( b \). Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the code works correctly for every potential case:

1. **Initialization**: The variables `i`, `j`, and `c` are initialized to 0. `i` keeps track of the current position in string \( a \), `j` keeps track of the current position in string \( b \), and `c` counts the length of the longest prefix of \( a \) that is a subsequence of \( b \).

2. **Main Loop**: The `while` loop continues as long as `j` is less than the length of \( b \) and `i` is less than the length of \( a \). This ensures that we do not go out of bounds while checking for subsequences.

3. **Finding the Next Occurrence**: The function `func_1` is called with the current positions of `i` and `j` to find the next occurrence of `a[i]` in the substring of \( b \) starting from `j`. The function `find` is used to locate the index of `a[i]` in the substring of \( b \) starting from `j`. If found, the function returns the adjusted index; otherwise, it returns -1.

4. **Updating Pointers and Counter**: If `new_j` is not -1, it means `a[i]` was found in \( b \) starting from `j`. The pointers `j` and `i` are updated to the next positions, and the counter `c` is incremented. If `new_j` is -1, it means `a[i]` is not found in the remaining part of \( b \), and the loop breaks.

5. **Output**: For each test case, the value of `c` (the length of the longest prefix of \( a \) that is a subsequence of \( b \)) is printed.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's consider the first test case from the problem description:

**Input:**
```
5 4
10011
1110
```

**Execution:**
- `i = 0`, `j = 0`, `c = 0`
- `func_1(a, b, 0, 0)` finds `a[0]` ('1') at `b[0]`, so `j` becomes 1, `i` becomes 1, `c` becomes 1.
- `func_1(a, b, 1, 1)` finds `a[1]` ('0') at `b[3]`, so `j` becomes 4, `i` becomes 2, `c` becomes 2.
- `func_1(a, b, 2, 4)` does not find `a[2]` ('0') in the remaining part of \( b \), so the loop breaks.
- Output: `2`

The program correctly handles this case and all other provided examples. There are no edge cases where the program fails to produce the correct output. Therefore, the program is correct.
