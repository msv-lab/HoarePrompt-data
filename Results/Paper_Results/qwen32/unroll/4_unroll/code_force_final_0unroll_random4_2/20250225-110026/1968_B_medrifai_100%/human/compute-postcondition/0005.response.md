Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `a` and `b`, which are binary strings, and `i` and `j`, which are non-negative integers representing the current indices of `a` and `b` respectively. The function returns the sum of `j` and the index of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]` if `a[i]` is found. Otherwise, it returns -1.**
