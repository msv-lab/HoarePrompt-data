#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ 5) representing the number of problems in the bank and the number of upcoming rounds, respectively. Following these integers, there is a string a of n characters, where each character is from 'A' to 'G', representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = input()
        
        ans = 0
        
        p = 'ABCDEFG'
        
        hmp = Counter(s)
        
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
        
        for i in hmp:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The loop has finished processing all test cases, and no variables outside the loop body retain any specific values from the last iteration. The only output is the printed value of `ans` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of problems and their difficulties, and the number of upcoming rounds. For each test case, it calculates and prints the total number of additional problems needed to ensure that each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G' is represented in at least the number of upcoming rounds specified.
