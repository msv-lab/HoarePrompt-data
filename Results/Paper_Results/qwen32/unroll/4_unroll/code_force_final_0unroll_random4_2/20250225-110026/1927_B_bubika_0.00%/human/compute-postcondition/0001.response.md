The code snippet initializes a list `b` with 26 zeros. This list is intended to keep track of the frequency of each letter in the alphabet, where `b[0]` corresponds to 'a', `b[1]` to 'b', and so on up to `b[25]` which corresponds to 'z'.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `b`, which is now a list of 26 zeros.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. It is guaranteed that for each test case, there exists a suitable string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z that corresponds to the given trace `a`. `b` is a list of 26 zeros.**
