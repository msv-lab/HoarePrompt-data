The provided code snippet `a = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` assigns the string containing all lowercase letters of the alphabet to the variable `a`. This assignment does not affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state, such as `t` and `n`, or the list `a` which was previously described as a list of integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. It is guaranteed that for each test case, there exists a suitable string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z that corresponds to the given trace `a`.**
