Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it constructs and prints a string of lowercase Latin letters based on a given list of integers. Each integer in the list corresponds to a letter in the alphabet, and the function ensures that the letters are chosen such that the sequence matches the provided trace. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but outputs the constructed strings for each test case.**
