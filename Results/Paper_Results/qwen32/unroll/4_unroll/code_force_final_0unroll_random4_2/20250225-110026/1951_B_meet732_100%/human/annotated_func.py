#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list containing multiple test cases. Each test case is represented as a list where the first element is a list of two integers [n, k] with 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and the second element is a list of n integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, where each rating is a unique integer between 1 and 10^9. The total number of cows across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a list of test cases, where each test case includes the number of cows `n` and an integer `k`, along with a list of unique ratings for the cows. It determines and returns an index based on the ratings relative to the rating at index `k-1` in the first test case. The return value is one of several possible indices or values derived from the conditions specified in the test case.
