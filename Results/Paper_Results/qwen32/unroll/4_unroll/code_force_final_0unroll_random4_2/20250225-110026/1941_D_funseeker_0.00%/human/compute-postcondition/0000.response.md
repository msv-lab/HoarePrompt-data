The code snippet assigns the values returned by `func_3()` to the variables `n`, `m`, and `x`. The initial state of these variables is updated to reflect the new values returned by `func_3()`. The other variables (`r` and `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`. `r` is an integer such that 1 <= r <= n - 1, and `c` is a character that can be '0', '1', or '?'.**
