The code `ans.discard(0)` removes the element `0` from the set `ans` if `0` is present in it. Given that `0` is one of the elements in `ans`, it will be removed. The other elements in `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is a set of integers that have been transformed through a series of additions and subtractions modulo `n` based on the values of `r` and `c` obtained from `func_1()` in each of the `m` iterations, and `0` is no longer an element in `ans`.**
