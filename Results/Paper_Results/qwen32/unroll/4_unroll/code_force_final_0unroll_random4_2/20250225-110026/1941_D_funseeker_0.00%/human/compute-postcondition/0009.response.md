Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Explanation
1. **`ans`**: This is a set of integers. The set has undergone transformations through a series of operations involving additions and subtractions modulo `n`. These operations are based on the values of `r` and `c` obtained from `func_1()` in each of the `m` iterations.
2. **Transformation Details**:
   - If `0` was an element in `ans` before the `if` statement, it is removed from `ans`.
   - `n` is added to `ans` regardless of whether `0` was initially in `ans` or not.

### Print Statement
The print statement is:
```python
print(*ans)
```
This statement unpacks the set `ans` and prints all its elements separated by spaces.

### Determining the Output
Given the transformation rules:
- If `0` was originally in `ans`, it will no longer be present.
- `n` will definitely be in `ans`.

Since the exact initial content of `ans` is not provided, we can only describe the final state based on the transformations:
- `ans` will definitely contain `n`.
- If `0` was originally in `ans`, it will be removed.
- All other elements of `ans` will remain unchanged from their state after the transformations.

### Final Output
Thus, the output will be all the elements of the set `ans` after the transformations, which includes `n` and potentially other integers, but does not include `0` if it was originally present.

Output: **n [other elements of ans excluding 0] (where n is definitely in ans and 0 is not in ans if it was originally present)**
