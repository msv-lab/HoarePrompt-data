Correctness: **False**

The given program has a small issue with how it handles the modulo operation. Specifically, when the result of `(q - r) % n` is `0`, it should be mapped to `n` because the players are numbered from `1` to `n`, not `0` to `n-1`. However, the program correctly handles this by checking if `0` is in the set and replacing it with `n`. But there is a more subtle issue.

The problem arises when `r` is equal to `n`, which is not possible given the constraints (`1 ≤ r_i ≤ n - 1`). However, the modulo operation can still result in `0` if `q - r` is a negative multiple of `n`. This is not an issue because `r` is guaranteed to be less than `n`, but the logic should still be robust.

The main issue is that the program does not sort the final set of possible players before printing them. The output requires the player numbers in increasing order, which the current program does not guarantee.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
from functools import lru_cache

# Function 1:
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()

# Function 2:
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())

# Function 3:
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))

# Function 4:
def func_4():
    (n, m, x) = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        (r, c) = func_1().split()
        r = int(r)
        temp = set()
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r - 1) % n + 1)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r - 1) % n + 1)
        ans = temp
    print(len(ans))
    print(*sorted(ans))

# Main function to handle multiple test cases
def main():
    t = func_2()
    for _ in range(t):
        func_4()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this corrected version, the results are sorted before printing, ensuring the output meets the problem's requirements.
