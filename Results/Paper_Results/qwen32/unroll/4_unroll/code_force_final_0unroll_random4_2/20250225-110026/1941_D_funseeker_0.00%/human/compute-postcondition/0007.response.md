Postcondition: **`ans` is a set of integers that have been transformed through a series of additions and subtractions modulo `n` based on the values of `r` and `c` obtained from `func_1()` in each of the `m` iterations. If `0` was an element in `ans` before the if statement, it is no longer an element in `ans` and `n` is an element in `ans`. If `0` was not an element in `ans`, no changes are made to `ans`.**
