Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `f`, `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines whether the `f`-th element in the original list is greater than, less than, or possibly equal to the `k`-th largest element in the sorted list, and prints 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' accordingly.**
