The provided code snippet only reads an integer input representing the number of test cases, `t`. No other variables are modified or introduced in this snippet. Therefore, the initial state of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remains unchanged. The new variable `t` is introduced and assigned the value of the input integer.

Output State: **Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order; the number of test cases t is an input integer.**
