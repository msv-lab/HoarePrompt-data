The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the scores. If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints -1. Otherwise, it determines the maximum possible score that can be achieved under certain conditions and prints that value.
