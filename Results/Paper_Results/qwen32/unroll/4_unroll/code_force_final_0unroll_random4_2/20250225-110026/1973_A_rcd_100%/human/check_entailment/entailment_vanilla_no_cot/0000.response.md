Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Objective**: Determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given the scores of three players.
2. **Constraints**:
   - Scores are non-decreasing: \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).
   - Total points must be even since each game awards either 2 points (in case of a win) or 2 points (in case of a draw).
   - The same pair of players could have played any non-negative number of times.
3. **Output**:
   - Maximum number of draws.
   - `-1` if the given scores are impossible.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case:
- Checks if the total points \((p_1 + p_2 + p_3)\) are even. If not, it prints `-1` because the scores cannot be achieved with a valid number of games.
- If the total points are even, it proceeds to determine the maximum number of draws:
  - If \( p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2 \), it prints \( p_1 + p_2 \) (this is based on the idea that the highest score \( p_3 \) could be achieved by winning all games against the other two players, and the other two players could have drawn among themselves).
  - Otherwise, it uses a loop to find the maximum number of draws by adjusting the points of the players.

### Correctness of the Program
Let's verify the correctness of the program by analyzing the logic:
1. **Total Points Check**: The program correctly checks if the total points are even. If not, it outputs `-1`, which is correct.
2. **Case \( p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2 \)**: This logic seems correct because if the highest score is at least the sum of the other two scores, it implies that the player with \( p_3 \) could have won all games against the other two players, and the other two players could have drawn among themselves.
3. **Loop for Adjusting Points**: The loop is intended to find the maximum number of draws by adjusting the points of the players. However, there is a logical flaw in the loop. The loop condition and the logic inside the loop do not correctly ensure that the maximum number of draws is found. For example, the condition `if p1 - x <= p2 - y` does not accurately represent the scenario where the maximum number of draws is being calculated.

### Example Analysis
Let's consider the example inputs and outputs:
- **Input**: `0 0 0`
  - **Output**: `0` (Correct)
- **Input**: `0 1 1`
  - **Output**: `1` (Correct)
- **Input**: `1 1 1`
  - **Output**: `-1` (Correct)
- **Input**: `1 1 2`
  - **Output**: `2` (Incorrect, should be `1`)
- **Input**: `3 3 3`
  - **Output**: `-1` (Correct)
- **Input**: `3 4 5`
  - **Output**: `6` (Incorrect, should be `4`)
- **Input**: `1 1 10`
  - **Output**: `2` (Incorrect, should be `-1`)

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws for all cases. Specifically, the logic in the loop is flawed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
