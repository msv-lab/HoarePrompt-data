The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variables `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` do not affect the execution of the loop directly, but they are part of the state before the loop starts.

To ensure that the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` can remain as they are because they do not influence the loop's execution.

State: **`p_1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3`, `t` must be greater than 0**
