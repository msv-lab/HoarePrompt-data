Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`, followed by the array `a` of `n` integers.
   
2. **Sorting:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows us to easily identify the smallest and largest elements, which are important for both Alice and Bob's optimal strategies.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after both players have made their moves.
   - `s` is the initial sum of all elements in the array.
   - `s2` is the sum of the `x` largest elements in the array (which Bob might negate).
   - `pos` is a list that will store the possible sums after different combinations of Alice's removals and Bob's negations.
   - The first element added to `pos` is `s - 2 * s2`, representing the sum if Alice does not remove any elements and Bob negates the `x` largest elements.
   - The loop iterates from 1 to `removals` (inclusive), simulating Alice removing `i` elements from the end of the sorted array (the largest elements). For each removal:
     - `s` is updated by subtracting the removed element.
     - `s2` is adjusted to account for the new set of `x` largest elements after removals.
     - The new possible sum is calculated and added to `pos`.
   - The function returns the maximum value from `pos`.

### Correctness Analysis

- **Optimal Strategy for Alice:**
  - Alice's strategy is to remove the `k` largest elements to maximize the sum after Bob's negations. The program correctly simulates this by considering all possible numbers of removals from 0 to `k`.
  
- **Optimal Strategy for Bob:**
  - Bob's strategy is to negate the `x` smallest elements (from the remaining elements after Alice's removals) to minimize the sum. The program correctly calculates the sum if Bob negates the `x` largest elements from the remaining array after Alice's removals.
  
- **Handling Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases such as when `k` or `x` equals `n` (Alice or Bob can remove or negate all elements).
  - The program also handles cases where `k` or `x` is 1, ensuring that only one element is removed or negated, respectively.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic for both players to play optimally and calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after their moves. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness:** **True**
