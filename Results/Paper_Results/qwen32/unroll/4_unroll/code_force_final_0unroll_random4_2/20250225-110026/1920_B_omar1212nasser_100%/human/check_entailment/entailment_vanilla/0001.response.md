Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Alice's Move**: Alice can remove up to `k` elements from the array. Her goal is to maximize the sum of the remaining elements.
2. **Bob's Move**: After Alice's move, Bob can multiply up to `x` elements by -1. His goal is to minimize the sum of the array.
3. **Objective**: Find the final sum of the array after both players play optimally.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution consists of two functions:
- `func_1()`: This function handles input reading and output printing. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `x`, and the array `a`. It then calls `func_2()` with these parameters and prints the result.
- `func_2(removals, negatives, elements)`: This function computes the optimal sum after Alice and Bob's moves.

#### Key Points in `func_2`
- The function first sorts the array `elements`.
- It calculates the sum `s` of all elements.
- It calculates the sum `s2` of the `negatives` largest elements.
- It computes the sum after Alice removes `i` elements and Bob negates `negatives + i` elements, storing these sums in the list `pos`.
- It returns the maximum value in `pos`, which represents the optimal sum after both players' moves.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to facilitate the selection of the largest elements for negation.
2. **Initial Sum Calculation**: `s` is the sum of all elements.
3. **Negation Sum Calculation**: `s2` is the sum of the `negatives` largest elements.
4. **Iterative Calculation**: The function iteratively computes the sum after Alice removes `i` elements and Bob negates `negatives + i` elements. This ensures that all possible optimal scenarios are considered.
5. **Maximization**: The function returns the maximum sum from all possible scenarios, ensuring that Alice and Bob play optimally.

### Conclusion

The provided solution correctly handles the problem requirements and constraints. It considers all possible optimal moves for both Alice and Bob and returns the correct final sum for each test case.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
