The function reads multiple test cases from the input, where each test case consists of integers `n`, `k`, `x`, and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. For each test case, it calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after Alice can remove up to `k` elements and Bob can multiply up to `x` elements by -1. The result for each test case is printed.
