To determine what will be printed by the `print(*a)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the transformation applied to the list `a`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is a list where the elements at even indices are reversed while the elements at odd indices remain the same.

### Transformation on `a`:
- Elements at even indices are reversed.
- Elements at odd indices remain unchanged.

### Understanding the Output:
To understand what `print(*a)` will output, we need to know how the list `a` is transformed.

Let's consider an example to illustrate the transformation:
- Suppose `a` is initially `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.
- Elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, 6) are `[1, 3, 5, 7]`.
- Reversing these elements gives `[7, 5, 3, 1]`.
- Elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5) are `[2, 4, 6]` and remain unchanged.
- Combining these, the transformed list `a` will be `[7, 2, 5, 4, 3, 6, 1]`.

### General Case:
For a general list `a` with `n` elements:
- Extract elements at even indices.
- Reverse this sublist.
- Place the reversed sublist back into the even indices of `a`.
- Elements at odd indices remain unchanged.

### Conclusion:
The output will be the transformed list `a` where elements at even indices are reversed, and elements at odd indices remain the same.

### Final Output:
Output: **the transformed list `a` where elements at even indices are reversed, and elements at odd indices remain the same**.
