Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block. The program simply counts the number of zeros between the first and last chip, which does not account for the actual minimum number of moves required to form a contiguous block of chips.

Let's consider a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
2
5
1 0 1 0 1
5
0 1 0 1 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
2
```

**Explanation of the expected output:**

- For the first test case, you can move the chip at position 5 to position 3 and the chip at position 3 to position 2. This takes 2 moves.
- For the second test case, you can move the chip at position 3 to position 2 and the chip at position 5 to position 4. This also takes 2 moves.

**Actual Output of the program:**
```
[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
2
[1, 0, 1, 0]
2
```

The program correctly identifies the number of zeros between the first and last chip in each test case, but it does not account for the optimal way to move the chips to form a contiguous block. For example, in the second test case, the program outputs 2, which is correct, but the logic used is not robust enough to handle all cases correctly.

A more correct approach would involve calculating the cost of moving each chip to a position where it can form a contiguous block with the other chips. The cost would be the sum of the distances each chip needs to move to reach its target position in the block.
