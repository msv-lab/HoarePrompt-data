Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, and a list `c` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines and prints either `k - 1` or `n` based on the frequency of integers in the list `c`. Specifically, it prints `k - 1` if any integer appears at least `k` times in the list; otherwise, it prints `n`.**
