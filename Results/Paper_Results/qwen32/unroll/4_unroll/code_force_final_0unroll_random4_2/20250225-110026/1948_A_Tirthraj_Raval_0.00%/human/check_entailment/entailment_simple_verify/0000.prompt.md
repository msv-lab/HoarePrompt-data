You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, there is an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))
        
    #State: a series of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, with 'YES' followed by a pattern of 'AB' repeated `n // 2` times for even `n`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program incorrectly handles the case when `n` is odd. According to the problem description, a string is valid if it contains exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The program currently only prints "YES" and constructs a string when `n` is even, and "NO" when `n` is odd. However, it is possible to construct a valid string with an odd number of special characters.

For example, consider `n = 1`. A valid string would be "AA", where the first 'A' is special because it is equal to its right neighbor, and the second 'A' is not special. Another example is `n = 3`, where a valid string could be "AABAA", with special characters at positions 1, 2, and 3.

Thus, the program should be able to handle cases where `n` is odd and construct a valid string in those cases as well. The current implementation incorrectly returns "NO" for odd `n`, making it incorrect for those cases.
