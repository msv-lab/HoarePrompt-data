In the given for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate over the range specified by `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The value of `t` is already defined as an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, which means the loop will definitely execute at least once given the constraints.

Since the loop head does not involve `n` directly, we do not need to adjust `n` for the loop to execute. The state of `t` is already provided and satisfies the condition for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50**
