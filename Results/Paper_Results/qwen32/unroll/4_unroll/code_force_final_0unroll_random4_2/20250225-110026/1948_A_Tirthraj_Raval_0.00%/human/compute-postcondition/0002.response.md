To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to analyze the behavior of the code for each test case based on the value of `n`.

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Check**:
   - For each of the `t` test cases, an integer `n` is read.
   - If `n` is odd, the program prints 'NO' and moves to the next test case.
   - If `n` is even, the program prints 'YES' and proceeds to generate a pattern.

2. **Pattern Generation**:
   - The pattern is generated by iterating `n // 2` times.
   - In each iteration, the characters 'A' and 'B' are appended in an alternating fashion to the `pattern` list.
   - Specifically, for each iteration `i`, the character 'A' or 'B' is chosen based on `i % 2` and `i % 2 ^ 1` (which is the bitwise XOR operation, effectively toggling between 0 and 1).

3. **Output Pattern**:
   - After the loop, the `pattern` list is joined into a string and printed.

4. **Final Output State**:
   - The final output state will consist of `t` lines of output, each corresponding to one test case.
   - For each test case, if `n` is odd, the output is 'NO'.
   - If `n` is even, the output is 'YES' followed by a string of 'AB' repeated `n // 2` times.

Given the constraints (1 <= `t` <= 50 and 1 <= `n` <= 50), the output state will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' followed by patterns of 'AB' for even `n`.

Output State: **a series of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, with 'YES' followed by a pattern of 'AB' repeated `n // 2` times for even `n`.**
