To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem and the logic implemented in the program.

### Problem Analysis:
- We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals contain at least one colored cell.
- The total number of diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid is \( 4n - 2 \).
- We need to find a strategy to color the fewest cells while ensuring that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.

### Strategy:
1. **Single Diagonal (k == 1):** If \( k == 1 \), we only need to color one cell, which can be placed in any diagonal.
2. **Fewer Than or Equal to \( 2n \) Diagonals (k <= 2n):** For \( k \leq 2n \), we can achieve the goal by coloring cells in a way that each colored cell covers as many diagonals as possible. The optimal strategy here is to color cells such that each cell covers two diagonals. Therefore, the number of cells needed is \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).
3. **More Than \( 2n \) Diagonals (k > 2n):** For \( k > 2n \), the strategy is more complex. We need to cover the additional diagonals with the fewest additional cells. The optimal strategy here is to color cells in a way that each cell covers two diagonals, but for the first \( 2n \) diagonals, we can cover them with \( n \) cells, and the remaining \( k - 2n \) diagonals can be covered with \( \lceil \frac{k - 2n}{2} \rceil \) additional cells. Therefore, the total number of cells needed is \( n + \lceil \frac{k - 2n}{2} \rceil \), which simplifies to \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) for \( k \leq 2n \) and \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \) for \( k > 2n \).

### Program Analysis:
The program correctly implements the above strategy:
- If \( k == 1 \), it prints `1`.
- If \( k \leq 2n \), it prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).
- If \( k > 2n \), it prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) which is equivalent to \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \) for integer division in Python.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of cells to color for each test case based on the provided logic.

Correctness: **True**
