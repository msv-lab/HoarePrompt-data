To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to analyze the given loop and conditions:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
   - `total_water` is the sum of the list `a`.
   - `total_water % n` equals 0, meaning `total_water` is divisible by `n`.
   - `target` is `total_water // n`.
   - `container` is 0.

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `water` in the list `a`.
   - For each element, it updates the `container` by adding the difference between `water` and `target`.
   - If at any point `container` becomes less than 0, the function returns 'No'.

3. **Logic Insight:**
   - The `target` represents the average water level that each element should ideally have for the sum to be evenly distributed.
   - The `container` tracks the cumulative deviation from this target.
   - If `container` ever goes negative, it means that the cumulative excess water in the previous elements is not enough to compensate for the current deficit, and thus the condition cannot be met.

4. **Final State:**
   - Since `total_water % n` equals 0, the sum of deviations from `target` over all elements in `a` must be 0. This means that any positive deviation in one part of the list must be exactly balanced by a negative deviation in another part.
   - Therefore, the `container` will never go negative during the loop, and the loop will complete without returning 'No'.
   - After the loop completes, the `container` will be 0 because the total sum of deviations from the target is 0.

Given these insights, the output state after the loop is:

Output State: **container is 0.**
