You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
a = list(map(int, data[1:]))
print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if total_water % n != 0:
        return 'No'
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers. It checks if it's possible to redistribute the elements of `a` such that each element becomes equal to the average of the list. If it is possible, the function returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective:** We need to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from any container i to any container j where i < j.
2. **Constraints:** 
   - The sum of water in all containers is divisible by `n`.
   - The operation can be performed any number of times.
3. **Approach:** 
   - Calculate the target amount of water each container should have after the operation, which is `total_water // n`.
   - Check if it is possible to redistribute the water such that no container ever has less water than the target amount during the process of redistribution.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads input from standard input and splits it into a list of strings.
   - The first element in the list is the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `a`.
   - The program then calls `func_1(n, a)` to determine if the redistribution is possible.

2. **Function `func_1(n, a)`:**
   - **Step 1:** Calculate the total amount of water `total_water`.
   - **Step 2:** Check if `total_water` is divisible by `n`. This is already guaranteed by the problem, so this step is redundant but does no harm.
   - **Step 3:** Calculate the target amount of water each container should have `target = total_water // n`.
   - **Step 4:** Initialize a variable `container` to keep track of the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the target.
   - **Step 5:** Iterate through each container's water amount:
     - Update `container` by adding the difference between the current container's water and the target.
     - If `container` becomes negative at any point, return 'No'. This means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to meet the target for the current container.
   - **Step 6:** If the loop completes without `container` becoming negative, return 'Yes'. This means that it is possible to redistribute the water such that all containers have the same amount.

3. **Logic Verification:**
   - The logic correctly checks if it is possible to redistribute the water without ever having a container with less water than the target. This ensures that the operation constraints (pouring from i to j where i < j) are respected.
   - The function returns 'Yes' only if it can ensure that the cumulative water level never goes below the target, which is a correct condition for the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operation. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The program correctly checks if it is possible to redistribute the water such that no container ever has less water than the target amount during the process. This ensures that the operation constraints are respected.
Correctness: **True**
