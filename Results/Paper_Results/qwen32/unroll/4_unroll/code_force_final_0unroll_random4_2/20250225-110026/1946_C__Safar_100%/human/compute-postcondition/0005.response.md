The code snippet calculates the integer division of `n` by `k` and assigns the result to the variable `r`. The values of `n`, `k`, `edges`, `g`, `c`, and `l` remain unchanged. The new variable `r` is introduced with the calculated value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b in the tree, `g` is a list of `n+1` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` by an edge in the tree, `c` is 0, `l` is 1, `r` is `n // k`.**
