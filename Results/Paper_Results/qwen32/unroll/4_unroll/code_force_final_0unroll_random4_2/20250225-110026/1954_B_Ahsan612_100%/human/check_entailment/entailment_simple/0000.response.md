### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and determine whether it correctly solves the problem.

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. If it's impossible to make it stop being beautiful, we should output -1.

The given program iterates through each test case and processes each array `ar` as follows:
1. It initializes `same` to 1, `num` to the first element of `ar`, and `minn` to infinity.
2. It then iterates over the array, checking for contiguous segments of identical numbers.
3. When it encounters a segment of identical numbers, it increments `same` for each element in the segment.
4. When it encounters a different number, it updates `minn` with the minimum length of the previously found segment and resets `same` to 1.
5. After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time with the length of the final segment.
6. If `minn` is still infinity (which means the array was empty) or if `minn` is equal to the length of the array (which means the entire array was a single segment of identical numbers), it prints -1.
7. Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

This approach seems to be aimed at finding the shortest segment of identical numbers in the array. However, this is not necessarily the correct approach to solve the problem. The problem requires us to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful, which means we need to consider more than just the shortest segment.

For example, consider the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`. The shortest segment here is `[5]`, which has a length of 1. However, removing just one element (the `5`) does not make the array stop being beautiful because we can still perform operations to make all elements the same. Instead, we need to remove three elements to make it stop being beautiful, as shown in the example.

The given program does not correctly account for the need to break the beautiful property of the array by removing elements in a way that prevents all elements from becoming the same through the allowed operations.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

**Correctness: False**
