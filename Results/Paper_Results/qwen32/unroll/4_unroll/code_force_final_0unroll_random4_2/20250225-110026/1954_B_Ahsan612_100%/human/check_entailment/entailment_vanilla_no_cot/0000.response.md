Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program aims to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. However, the logic in the program is flawed and does not correctly address the problem requirements.

The program attempts to find the smallest group of consecutive identical elements and assumes that removing all elements of this group will make the array no longer beautiful. This approach is incorrect because the beauty of the array is determined by the ability to apply the specified operation (replacing an element with its neighbor if the neighbor elements are the same) to make all elements the same. Simply removing the smallest group of consecutive identical elements does not guarantee that the array will no longer be beautiful.

For example, consider the array `3 3 3 5 3 3 3`. The program will identify the group `5` as the smallest group and suggest removing it, resulting in `3 3 3 3 3 3`, which is still beautiful. The correct approach would involve a more complex analysis of the array structure to ensure that the array can no longer be made uniform through the specified operation.

Thus, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.
