### Reasoning:
The program aims to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. The key is to identify the smallest segment of consecutive identical elements within the array, as removing all elements from such a segment will ensure the array is no longer beautiful.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**: For each test case, the program initializes `same` to 1 (to count the length of the current segment of identical elements), `num` to the first element of the array, and `minn` to infinity (to keep track of the minimum segment length).

2. **Iterating through the array**: The program iterates through the array starting from the second element. For each element:
   - If the current element is the same as the previous one (`num`), it increments `same`.
   - If the current element is different, it updates `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`, then resets `same` to 1 and updates `num` to the current element.
   
3. **Final check**: After the loop, it performs a final check to update `minn` with the length of the last segment (`same`).

4. **Output**: The program checks if `minn` is still infinity (which would mean the array is empty) or if `minn` equals the length of the array (which means the entire array consists of a single segment of identical elements). In either case, it prints `-1` because the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements. Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

### Evaluation:
The program correctly identifies the smallest segment of consecutive identical elements and determines if the array can be made non-beautiful by removing all elements from such a segment. If the array is already composed of a single segment of identical elements, it correctly outputs `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
