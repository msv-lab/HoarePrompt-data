### Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the program to ensure it correctly determines the minimum number of elements to remove to make a beautiful array non-beautiful.

#### Key Points of the Program:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `same` is initialized to 1 to count consecutive elements that are the same.
   - `num` is initialized to the first element of the array.
   - `minn` is initialized to infinity (`inf`) to track the minimum length of segments of identical numbers.

2. **Loop through the Array**:
   - The loop iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element is the same as `num`, `same` is incremented.
   - If the current element is different from `num`, the loop updates `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to the current element.
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 after each iteration.

3. **Final Update**:
   - After the loop, `minn` is updated one last time with the minimum of `minn` and `same` to account for the last segment of identical numbers.

4. **Decision Making**:
   - If `minn` is still `inf` (which means no different elements were found) or `minn` is equal to the length of the array (`minn == len(ar)`), the array is already uniform, and it's impossible to make it non-beautiful. The program outputs `-1`.
   - Otherwise, the program outputs `minn`, which is the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

#### Evaluation Using Annotated Code:
- The annotations confirm that `same` counts the length of contiguous segments of identical numbers.
- `minn` correctly tracks the minimum length of these segments.
- The final check for `minn` ensures that if the array is uniform or cannot be made non-beautiful, `-1` is returned.

#### Testing with Examples:
1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `3, 2 2 2`
   - Output: `-1`
   - Explanation: The entire array is uniform, and it's impossible to make it non-beautiful.
   - The program correctly outputs `-1`.

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `5, 1 2 1 2 1`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Removing one element (e.g., the last `1`) results in an array that cannot be made uniform using the given operation.
   - The program correctly outputs `1`.

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `1, 1`
   - Output: `-1`
   - Explanation: The array is already uniform and cannot be made non-beautiful.
   - The program correctly outputs `-1`.

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `7, 3 3 3 5 3 3 3`
   - Output: `3`
   - Explanation: Removing the first three `3`s results in an array that cannot be made uniform.
   - The program correctly outputs `3`.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if an array can be made non-beautiful and calculates the minimum number of elements to remove when possible. The annotations and the test cases support the correctness of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
