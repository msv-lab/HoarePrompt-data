### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program's logic and correctness based on the problem description and function summary.

#### Problem Recap:
The task is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. An array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \) if \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \).

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program works as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
3. It initializes `same` to count the number of consecutive elements that are the same.
4. It iterates through the array, updating `same` when consecutive elements are the same.
5. When it encounters a different element, it updates the minimum count of consecutive elements (`minn`) and resets `same`.
6. After the loop, it checks the last sequence of elements.
7. If `minn` is still `inf` (which means no different elements were found) or if the entire array is composed of the same element (`minn == len(ar)`), it prints `-1` (impossible to make non-beautiful).
8. Otherwise, it prints `minn` (the minimum number of elements to remove).

#### Correctness Evaluation:
Let's evaluate the correctness of the program using the provided examples and the logic described:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `3, 2 2 2`
   - Output: `-1`
   - Explanation: The entire array is the same, and it's impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - The program correctly outputs `-1`.

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `5, 1 2 1 2 1`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Removing one element (e.g., the last `1`) results in an array that cannot be made uniform using the given operation.
   - The program correctly outputs `1`.

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `1, 1`
   - Output: `-1`
   - Explanation: The array is already uniform and cannot be made non-beautiful.
   - The program correctly outputs `-1`.

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `7, 3 3 3 5 3 3 3`
   - Output: `3`
   - Explanation: Removing the first three `3`s results in an array that cannot be made uniform.
   - The program correctly outputs `3`.

#### Challenges:
Let's consider the logic in more detail:
- The program calculates the minimum length of contiguous segments of identical numbers.
- If this minimum length is `1` or the entire array is uniform (`minn == len(ar)`), it outputs `-1`.
- Otherwise, it outputs `minn`.

However, the logic needs to be more precise:
- The program should consider the possibility of removing elements such that no segment of identical numbers can be used to make the entire array uniform.
- The current logic does not account for more complex scenarios where multiple segments need to be considered.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
- Input: `5, 1 1 2 2 1`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Explanation: Removing two `1`s (e.g., the first and last) results in an array `1 2 2` which cannot be made uniform.

The program would output `1` because the minimum segment length is `1`, but this is incorrect because removing one `1` does not make the array non-beautiful.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, it does not account for scenarios where multiple segments need to be considered to determine the minimum number of elements to remove.

Final: **False**
