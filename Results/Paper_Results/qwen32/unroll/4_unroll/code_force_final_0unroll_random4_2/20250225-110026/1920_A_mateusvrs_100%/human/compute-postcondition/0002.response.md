The only variable in the loop head of the provided for loop is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the execution of the loop. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. Therefore, the state of `t` is the only one that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Given that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, the loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. Since the problem states that `t` is already an integer in the range 1 to 500, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes. However, to adhere to the format and make it explicit that `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute, we can state it as such.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same, `r` is an empty list**
