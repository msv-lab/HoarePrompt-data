To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to understand how the list `r` is constructed based on the provided initial state.

The list `r` consists of `t` integers, each determined by the following logic:
- For each iteration, if the maximum value from type 1 constraints (`bx`) is greater than the minimum value from type 2 constraints (`ax`), the corresponding element in `r` is set to 0.
- Otherwise, the element is calculated as `ax - bx + 1` minus the count of values in the set `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.

Given this, the output of `print(*r, sep='\n')` will be each element of the list `r` printed on a new line.

However, the exact values of `r` depend on the specific values of `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` for each iteration, which are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of the logic that generates each element of `r`.

Output: **Each element of the list `r` is printed on a new line, where each element is either 0 (if `bx > ax`) or `ax - bx + 1` minus the count of values in the set `cx` within the range `[bx, ax]` (otherwise)**.
