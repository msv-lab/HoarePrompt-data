### Reasoning:
The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with a set of constraints on the integer \( k \). Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints \( n \).
   - It then reads each constraint, which is a pair of integers \((a, x)\) representing the type and value of the constraint.

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - **Type 1 Constraints (\( a = 1 \)):** These constraints specify that \( k \) must be greater than or equal to \( x \). The program keeps track of the maximum value among these constraints using `bx`.
   - **Type 2 Constraints (\( a = 2 \)):** These constraints specify that \( k \) must be less than or equal to \( x \). The program keeps track of the minimum value among these constraints using `ax`.
   - **Type 3 Constraints (\( a = 3 \)):** These constraints specify that \( k \) must not be equal to \( x \). These values are stored in a set `cx`.

3. **Determining Valid \( k \) Values:**
   - If `bx` (the maximum value from type 1 constraints) is greater than `ax` (the minimum value from type 2 constraints), it means there is no valid \( k \) that can satisfy both types of constraints simultaneously, so the result for that test case is `0`.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts the count of integers in this range that are present in the set `cx` (i.e., those specified in type 3 constraints).

4. **Output:**
   - The results for all test cases are stored in a list `r`, which is then printed, with each result on a new line.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers \( k \) for each test case according to the problem statement. It handles all specified constraint types and correctly computes the final result based on the given conditions.

### Correctness:
