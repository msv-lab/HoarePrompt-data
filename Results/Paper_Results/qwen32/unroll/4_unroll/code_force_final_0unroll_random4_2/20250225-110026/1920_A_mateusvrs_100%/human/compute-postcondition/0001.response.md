Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. Each constraint is described by a pair of integers (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2. No two constraints are the same (all pairs (a, x) are distinct). `r` is an empty list.**

In natural language: The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The constraints described by pairs (a, x) are still valid and unchanged. A new variable `r` has been initialized as an empty list.
