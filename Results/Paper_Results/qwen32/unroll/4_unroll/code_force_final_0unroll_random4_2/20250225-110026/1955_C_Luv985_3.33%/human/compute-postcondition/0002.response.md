The `while` loop in the provided code is `while T:`. This loop will execute as long as `T` is a non-zero value. Given that `T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 10^4\), it is already guaranteed that `T` is non-zero, and thus the loop can certainly execute at least once.

Since no adjustments are needed to ensure the loop executes, we simply repeat the program state right before the loop.

State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
