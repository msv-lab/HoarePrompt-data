Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 3 * 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 <= `k` <= `n`. Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 <= `r_i`, `c_i` <= `n`. It is guaranteed that the `k` moves and the implied computer moves are valid, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of the integer input, which represents the number of test cases. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`) and their constraints remain unchanged as they are not yet assigned values in the provided code snippet.
