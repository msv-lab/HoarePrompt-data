t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n. Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n. It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
