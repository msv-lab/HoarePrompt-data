The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This line of code takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state mentions that `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and `u2vs` is a list of lists where `u2vs[u]` contains the list of vertices directly connected to vertex `u` (0-indexed). 

After executing the code, `n` will be updated to the integer value provided by the user. The variable `u2vs` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value provided by the user, `u2vs` is a list of lists where `u2vs[u]` contains the list of vertices directly connected to vertex `u` (0-indexed).**
