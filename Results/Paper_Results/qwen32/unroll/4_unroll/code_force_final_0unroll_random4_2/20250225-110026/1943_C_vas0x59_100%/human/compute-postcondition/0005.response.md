To determine the output state, we need to understand what the function `func_1` does to the dictionary `d`. Without the specific implementation of `func_1`, we can only assume that `func_1` processes the dictionary `d` in some way and returns a value `a`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the only variable that could be affected is `a`, as it is the result of `func_1(d)`. The variables `n`, `u2vs`, and `d` remain unchanged unless `func_1` modifies them, which is not typical for a function to do unless explicitly stated.

Since we don't have the details of `func_1`, we can only state that `a` is assigned the result of `func_1(d)`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is the integer value provided by the user; `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices (0-based) of the nodes directly connected to the corresponding node in an undirected graph; `d` is a dictionary where keys are node indices from 0 to `n-1` and values are the shortest distances from node `0` to these nodes; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`**.
