### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix using no more than 2n operations, where each operation can either fill a row or a column with a permutation of integers from 1 to n.

Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix, `n`.

2. **Calculating the Maximum Sum:**
   - The sum is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \times i
     \]
   - Simplifying the inner part of the summation:
     \[
     i^2 - (i-1)^2 = i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1) = 2i - 1
     \]
   - Therefore, the sum becomes:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \times i
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i)
     \]
   - This further simplifies to:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + 2\sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 - \sum_{i=2}^{n} i
     \]
   - Using the formulas for the sum of squares and the sum of integers, we can verify that this matches the expected maximum sum for the matrix.

3. **Printing the Number of Operations:**
   - The program prints `n + n` operations, which is `2n` as required.

4. **Generating Operations:**
   - The program generates `n` Type 1 operations and `n` Type 2 operations.
   - Each Type 1 operation fills a row with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - Each Type 2 operation fills a column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - The rows and columns are filled in reverse order, i.e., starting from the last row/column and moving to the first.

### Verification:

- **Sum Calculation:**
  - The sum calculation in the program matches the expected maximum sum for the matrix.
  - This is because each row and column will be filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`, and the sum of each row/column will be `1 + 2 + ... + n = n(n + 1) / 2`.
  - Since there are `n` rows and `n` columns, the total sum will be:
    \[
    \text{sum} = n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} + n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} - \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} = n^2 \times \frac{n + 1}{2} = \frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2}
    \]
  - This matches the expected maximum sum.

- **Number of Operations:**
  - The program uses exactly `2n` operations, which is within the allowed limit.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and generates the required operations within the constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
