To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify if it correctly maximizes the sum of all the numbers in the matrix using no more than 2n operations for each test case.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the sum of the matrix using a specific formula.
   - The formula given in the code is:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i
     \]
   - Simplifying the term inside the summation:
     \[
     i^2 - (i-1)^2 = i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1) = 2i - 1
     \]
   - Therefore, the sum becomes:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \cdot i = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i)
     \]
   - This can be further simplified to:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + 2\sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 - \sum_{i=2}^{n} i
     \]
   - The sum of squares and the sum of integers can be calculated directly:
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6}
     \]
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
     \]
   - Thus, the sum can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + 2\left(\frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6} - 1\right) - \left(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} - 1\right)
     \]
   - Simplifying this will give the correct sum for the matrix.

2. **Operations:**
   - The program performs exactly 2n operations.
   - For each row and column, it performs a type 1 and a type 2 operation with the permutation `1, 2, ..., n`.
   - This means it sets each row and each column to the permutation `1, 2, ..., n`.

### Verification:

- **Sum Calculation:**
  - The sum calculated by the program is correct based on the derived formula.
  
- **Operations:**
  - The operations performed are within the limit of 2n operations.
  - Assigning each row and each column to the permutation `1, 2, ..., n` ensures that each element in the matrix is set to a unique value from 1 to n, maximizing the sum.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and performs the operations within the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
