Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly implement the operations to maximize the sum of the matrix. Let's analyze the given program and the problem description:

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of the matrix using no more than 2n operations. The operations allowed are:
1. Assigning a row `i` with a permutation `p`.
2. Assigning a column `i` with a permutation `p`.

### Program Analysis:
The given program calculates the sum of the matrix and prints the operations incorrectly. Here are some issues:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum using the formula `sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`. This formula does not correctly compute the maximum sum that can be achieved by filling the matrix with permutations.

2. **Operations**:
   - The program prints `n + n` operations, which is correct in terms of the number of operations, but the operations themselves are not optimal.
   - The operations are defined as `print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))` and `print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))`. These operations do not maximize the sum of the matrix.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the sum of the matrix, each row and each column should be filled with a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. The optimal way to do this is to fill the matrix with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n] for each row and each column, which ensures that each number from 1 to n appears exactly once in each row and each column.

### Example:
For `n = 2`, the optimal matrix would be:
```
1 2
2 1
```
The sum of this matrix is 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6.

However, the program outputs:
```
7 3
1 1 1 2
1 2 1 2
2 1 1 2
```
This is incorrect because the matrix would be:
```
1 2
1 2
```
The sum of this matrix is 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6, which is not the maximum possible sum of 7.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix and does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is False.
