Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to maximize the sum of all elements in an n x n matrix filled with zeros by performing a series of operations. Each operation can either fill a row or a column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. The goal is to achieve the maximum possible sum in no more than 2n operations.

### Maximum Sum Calculation:
The maximum sum can be achieved by filling the matrix in such a way that each number from 1 to n appears as many times as possible in the matrix. The optimal strategy involves filling the matrix with the highest possible numbers in as many positions as possible.

For an n x n matrix, the maximum sum is achieved by filling the matrix with numbers in a way that maximizes the contribution of each number. Specifically, the sum can be calculated as:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 \]

This is because each number \( i \) from 1 to n appears \( i \) times in the optimal configuration.

### Operation Strategy:
To achieve this, we can use a strategy where we fill the rows and columns in a specific order. The provided solution suggests filling the rows and columns in reverse order, using permutations that place higher numbers in more positions.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution calculates the maximum sum correctly using the formula:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 \]

Then, it outputs the operations needed to achieve this sum. The operations are structured as follows:
- For each row and column from 1 to n, it performs a Type 1 operation followed by a Type 2 operation using the permutation [1, 2, ..., n].

This ensures that each number from 1 to n is placed in the matrix in a way that maximizes the sum, and it does so in no more than 2n operations.

### Correctness Check:
- The sum calculation is correct.
- The operations are structured correctly to achieve the maximum sum.
- The number of operations (2n) is within the allowed limit.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution is correct and meets all the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
