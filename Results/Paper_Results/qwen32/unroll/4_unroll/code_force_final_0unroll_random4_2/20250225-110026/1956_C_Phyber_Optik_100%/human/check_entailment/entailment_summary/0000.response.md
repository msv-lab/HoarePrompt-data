### Reasoning:

The program is tasked with maximizing the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. The operations involve setting the elements of rows or columns to permutations of integers from 1 to \( n \).

Let's break down the program's logic:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum of the matrix based on a specific formula:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i
     \]
   - Simplifying the inner part of the sum:
     \[
     i^2 - (i-1)^2 = i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1) = 2i - 1
     \]
   - So, the sum becomes:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \cdot i = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i)
     \]
   - This formula correctly calculates the maximum sum achievable by filling the matrix with the maximum possible values in a structured way.

2. **Operations**:
   - The program outputs \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.
   - For each \( j \) from 1 to \( n \):
     - It performs a Type 1 operation on row \( n-j+1 \) with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
     - It performs a Type 2 operation on column \( n-j+1 \) with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - This sequence of operations ensures that each row and column is filled with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) in a way that maximizes the sum of the matrix.

### Verification with Example:

For \( n = 2 \):
- The calculated sum is:
  \[
  \text{sum} = 1 + (2^2 - 1^2) \cdot 2 = 1 + 3 \cdot 2 = 1 + 6 = 7
  \]
- The operations are:
  - Type 1 on row 2 with permutation \( [1, 2] \): \([1, 2]\)
  - Type 2 on column 2 with permutation \( [1, 2] \): \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 2 & 2 \end{bmatrix}\)
  - Type 1 on row 1 with permutation \( [1, 2] \): \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 2 & 2 \end{bmatrix}\)
  - Type 2 on column 1 with permutation \( [1, 2] \): \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 2 & 2 \end{bmatrix}\)
- The resulting matrix is \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 2 & 2 \end{bmatrix}\), and the sum is \( 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7 \).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and outputs a valid sequence of operations to achieve this sum within the allowed limit of \( 2n \) operations.
