The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is already an integer such that `1 <= t <= 500`. However, the code snippet will overwrite the existing value of `t` with the new integer input value. The variable `s` and its properties remain unchanged as the code does not interact with it.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'.**
