The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `s`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and it must satisfy the constraint 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500, consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. The function processes each string `s` and returns a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a string `s` for each of the `t` test cases. The string `s` consists only of the characters '0' and '1'. For each test case, the function returns a result based on the content of the string `s`.**
