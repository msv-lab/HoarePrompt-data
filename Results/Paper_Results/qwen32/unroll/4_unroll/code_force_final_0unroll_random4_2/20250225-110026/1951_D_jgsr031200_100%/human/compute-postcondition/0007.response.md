Given the initial state, we know that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\) and \(n \neq k\). Additionally, the current value of `n` is less than the current value of `k`.

However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('NO')
```
This statement directly prints the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
