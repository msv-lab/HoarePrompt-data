Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible values of `n` and `k` within the given constraints. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Approach**: The program tries to use a fixed set of costs `[n - k + 1, 1]` and checks if it can satisfy the condition `k` jewels bought. This is not a general solution and will fail for many inputs.

2. **Logic Flaw**: The logic inside the `func_1` function does not correctly determine if it's possible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The program does not consider all possible prices and stalls, and it does not guarantee that the total number of jewels bought will be exactly `k`.

3. **Output Format**: Even if the logic were correct, the output format for the prices of the stalls is incorrect. The program should output the prices in a way that ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

A correct approach to solve this problem would involve setting up the stalls with prices in such a way that the sum of the maximum number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall equals `k`. One way to achieve this is by using a greedy approach where you start with the highest possible price and decrease it, ensuring that the total number of jewels bought is exactly `k`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
        continue
    
    stalls = []
    remaining_jewels = k
    
    for price in range(1, 61):  # Try prices from 1 to 60
        if remaining_jewels == 0:
            break
        max_jewels_at_this_price = n // price
        if max_jewels_at_this_price == 0:
            continue
        jewels_to_buy = min(max_jewels_at_this_price, remaining_jewels)
        stalls.append(price)
        remaining_jewels -= jewels_to_buy
        n -= price * jewels_to_buy
    
    if remaining_jewels != 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(len(stalls))
        print(*stalls)
```

This solution checks if it's possible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by trying different prices and ensuring the total number of jewels bought is exactly `k`. If it is possible, it prints the number of stalls and their prices; otherwise, it prints "NO".
