### Reasoning:
The provided program has several issues and does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Handling the Special Cases**:
    - If `n == k`, the program correctly prints "YES", sets up 1 stall with a price of 1, and Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
    - If `n < k`, the program correctly prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy `k` jewels with less than `k` coins.

2. **General Case**:
    - The program tries to handle the general case by setting up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1`. However, this approach is flawed:
        - The logic `costs = [n - k + 1, 1]` does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 3`, the prices `[8, 1]` do not ensure Alice buys exactly 3 jewels. Alice will buy 1 jewel at the first stall (leaving 2 coins), and then buy 2 jewels at the second stall (leaving 0 coins), totaling 3 jewels, but this is not a general solution.
        - The loop `for i in costs` is not correctly implemented to determine the number of stalls and their prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
        - The calculation of `curr = n // i` and `h += curr` does not correctly track the number of jewels bought.
        - The condition `if (h < k)` is not correctly checking if the setup is valid.

3. **Correct Approach**:
    - A correct approach would be to use a binary search or a greedy method to determine the prices of the stalls. One possible solution is to use binary powers (like `[1, 2, 4, 8, ...]`) to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. For example, if `k = 8`, setting up stalls with prices `[128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]` ensures that Alice will buy exactly 8 jewels.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle the general case and does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels with the given constraints. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
