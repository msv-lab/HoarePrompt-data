The code snippet provided reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings. The initial state mentions that `t`, `n`, `q`, and `a` are defined with specific constraints and properties, while `data` is not defined prior to the code snippet.

Here is the impact of the code on the program:
- `data` is assigned the value of the input line split into a list of strings.

The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet. The only new variable introduced and modified is `data`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30. Each of the `q` queries is a pair of integers (l, r) such that 1 <= l < r <= n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line.**
