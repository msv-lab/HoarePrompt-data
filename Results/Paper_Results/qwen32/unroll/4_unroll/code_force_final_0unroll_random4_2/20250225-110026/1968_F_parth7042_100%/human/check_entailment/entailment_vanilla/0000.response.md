Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the input as a single string and splits it into a list of strings, `data`.
   - It then iterates over the test cases, reading `n` (the number of elements), `q` (the number of queries), the array `a`, and the queries themselves.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a prefix XOR array `pf` where `pf[i]` is the XOR of all elements from `a[1]` to `a[i]`.
   - It also uses a dictionary `mp` to store the indices where each prefix XOR value appears.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query defined by `l` and `r`, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` as `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
   - If `x` is 0, it immediately appends "YES" to the results list because a subarray with XOR of 0 can trivially be split into any number of parts with XOR 0.
   - If `x` is not 0, the program uses the dictionary `mp` to find the indices where the prefix XOR values `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]` occur.
   - It then uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the smallest index in `mp[pf[r]]` that is greater than or equal to `l` and the largest index in `mp[pf[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
   - If it finds such indices where the index from `mp[pf[r]]` is less than the index from `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, it appends "YES" to the results list, indicating that the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR. Otherwise, it appends "NO".

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all queries for all test cases, the program prints the results.

### Analysis of Correctness

- **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The prefix XOR calculation is correct and efficiently computes the XOR of any subarray in constant time using precomputed values.
- **Query Handling**: The logic for handling each query is correct. The program checks if there is a prefix XOR value that appears both before and after the subarray in question, which would imply that the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge case where the XOR of the subarray is 0, which means it can always be split into parts with XOR 0.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
