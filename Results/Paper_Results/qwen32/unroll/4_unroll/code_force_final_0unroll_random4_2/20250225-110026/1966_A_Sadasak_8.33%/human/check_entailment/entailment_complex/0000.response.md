### Reasoning:

The provided Python program attempts to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of cards left after performing the allowed operations. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation of the program.

1. **Logic for Minimum Cards Calculation**:
   - The program uses a function `func_1` to create a frequency table that caps the count of each number to `k`. However, this table does not directly help in determining the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations.
   - The program incorrectly checks if `k` is in the frequency table values and prints `k - 1` if it is. This check does not align with the logic required to find the minimum number of cards.

2. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach would involve determining the remainder when the count of each number is divided by `k`. This remainder represents the number of cards that cannot be exchanged for `k-1` cards.
   - The minimum number of cards left will be the sum of these remainders. If this sum is zero, the minimum number of cards left is 1 (since no operations can leave zero cards).

3. **Implementation Issues**:
   - The function `func_1` should return the sum of the remainders of the counts of each number divided by `k`.
   - The main logic should sum these remainders and print the result, ensuring that the result is at least 1.

### Correctness:

Given the issues mentioned above, the current implementation is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
