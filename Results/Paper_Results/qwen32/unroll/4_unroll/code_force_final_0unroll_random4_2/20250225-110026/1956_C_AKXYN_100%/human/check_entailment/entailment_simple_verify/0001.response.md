### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program's sum calculation is incorrect while the operations described are correct. Let's break down the reasoning in detail:

1. **Matrix Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a matrix of size `n x n` with each row filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This part is correct as it sets up the matrix for further operations.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum using the formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`, which is incorrect. The correct sum should be `n * n * n` because each cell in the `n x n` matrix will contain the value `n` after the operations.
   - The formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` does not correctly compute the sum of the matrix filled with `n` in each cell. Instead, it computes a different sum, which is not the maximum possible sum.

3. **Operations**:
   - The program correctly identifies that `2n` operations are needed: `n` operations to fill each row with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` and `n` operations to fill each column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - The operations themselves are correctly described and will indeed fill the matrix with the highest possible values.

### Correctness of the Program:

- **Operations**: The operations described are correct and will achieve the goal of maximizing the sum of the matrix.
- **Sum Calculation**: The sum calculation is incorrect. The program should output `n * n * n` as the maximum sum, not the sum calculated by the formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`.

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect due to the incorrect sum calculation. The operations described are correct, but the sum reported is not the maximum possible sum.

**Final: False**

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the incorrect sum calculation, and thus the final evaluation should be **False**.
