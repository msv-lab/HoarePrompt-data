Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix for all possible values of \( n \). Specifically, the program does not ensure that the sum is maximized using no more than \( 2n \) operations as required by the problem statement.

The program generates a matrix where each row and each column is filled with the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\). However, this approach does not guarantee the maximum sum. To maximize the sum, each element \( a_{i,j} \) should ideally be \( n \), which can be achieved by carefully choosing permutations for each row and column.

For example, consider the case when \( n = 2 \):

- The program will output:
  ```
  7 4
  1 2 1 2
  2 2 1 2
  1 1 1 2
  2 1 1 2
  ```
- However, the correct output should be:
  ```
  8 4
  1 1 2 1
  1 2 1 2
  2 1 2 1
  2 2 1 2
  ```

In the correct output, the matrix is:
```
2 1
1 2
```
Which sums to 8, whereas the matrix generated by the program:
```
2 1
2 1
```
Sums to 6. This shows that the program does not always produce the maximum possible sum.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
