### Reasoning:

The problem requires maximizing the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using a limited number of operations. The operations involve permuting rows or columns of the matrix. The goal is to achieve the maximum possible sum with no more than \( 2n \) operations.

The annotated program provided follows a specific strategy to achieve this:

1. **Matrix Initialization**: For each test case, an \( n \times n \) matrix is initialized where each row \( i \) is filled with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \). This is done using the line `mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]`.

2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the matrix elements is calculated using the formula `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`. This formula is derived from the fact that each row \( i \) (0-indexed) will contribute to the sum in a specific way when filled with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \). The sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), and the sum of the first \( n \) squares is \( \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \). The formula used here is a derived form that correctly computes the sum for the given problem constraints.

3. **Output**: The program prints the maximum sum `res` and the number of operations `n * 2`. It then prints the operations in the required format. Specifically, for each row and column, it performs a type 1 and a type 2 operation, which is done by the loop:
   ```python
   for i in range(n, 0, -1):
       print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
       print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```
   This loop ensures that each row and column is filled with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \), which maximizes the sum of the matrix.

### Verification:

- **Correctness of Sum Calculation**: The sum calculation formula `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` is correct for the specific way the matrix is filled. Each row contributes to the sum in a predictable manner, and the formula captures this correctly.
- **Number of Operations**: The program uses exactly \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.
- **Output Format**: The output format matches the problem requirements, with the correct number of operations and the correct format for each operation.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and provides a valid sequence of operations to achieve this sum within the constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
