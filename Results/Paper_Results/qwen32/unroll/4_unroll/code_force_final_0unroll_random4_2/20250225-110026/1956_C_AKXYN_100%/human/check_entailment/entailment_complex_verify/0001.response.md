### Reasoning:

Let's revisit the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the sum of all numbers in an `n x n` matrix by performing a series of operations. There are two types of operations:
1. Type 1: Assign a permutation to a row.
2. Type 2: Assign a permutation to a column.

Since permutations of numbers from 1 to `n` can be used, the maximum sum can be achieved by filling the matrix with the highest possible values. However, the maximum value for each cell `(i, j)` is not `n` because we need to consider the sum of all elements in the matrix. The optimal strategy is to fill each row and each column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` to maximize the sum.

#### Strategy to Maximize the Sum

To maximize the sum of the matrix, we need to ensure that each cell in the matrix is filled with the highest possible value. By filling each row and each column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`, every cell in the matrix will be filled with the maximum possible value for that position. However, the sum of the matrix can be computed directly as `n * (n * (n + 1) / 2)`, which is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers repeated `n` times for rows and `n` times for columns.

#### Sum Calculation

The maximum sum of the matrix is `n * (n * (n + 1) / 2)`, as each row and each column is filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

#### Operations Required

To fill each row and each column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`, we need `n` operations for the rows and `n` operations for the columns, totaling `2n` operations.

#### Program Analysis

Let's examine the provided program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Matrix Initialization**: It initializes a matrix of size `n x n` with each row filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
3. **Sum Calculation**: It calculates the sum of the matrix using the formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`, which is incorrect. The correct sum should be `n * (n * (n + 1) / 2)`.
4. **Output**: It prints the maximum sum and the number of operations (`2n`), followed by the operations themselves. The operations are correctly described as filling each row and each column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

### Correctness of the Program

The program correctly identifies the number of operations needed (`2n`) and the operations themselves. However, the sum calculation is incorrect. The program should calculate the sum as `n * (n * (n + 1) / 2)` instead of using the formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`.

### Conclusion

The program is incorrect due to the incorrect sum calculation. The operations described are correct, but the sum reported is not the maximum possible sum.

**Correctness: False**

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
