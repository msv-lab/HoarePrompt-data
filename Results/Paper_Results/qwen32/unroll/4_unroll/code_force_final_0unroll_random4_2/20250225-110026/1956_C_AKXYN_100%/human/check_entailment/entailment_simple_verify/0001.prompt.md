You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the sum of all numbers in an `n x n` matrix by performing a series of operations. There are two types of operations:
1. Type 1: Assign a permutation to a row.
2. Type 2: Assign a permutation to a column.

The maximum sum can be achieved by filling the matrix with the highest possible values using these operations. Since we can use permutations, the maximum sum for each cell `(i, j)` is `n` (the highest number in a permutation of `1` to `n`).

### Strategy to Maximize the Sum

To maximize the sum of the matrix, we need to ensure that each cell in the matrix is filled with the highest possible value, which is `n`. Since each operation can fill a row or a column with a permutation, we can achieve this by filling each row and each column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This way, every cell in the matrix will be filled with `n`.

### Calculating the Maximum Sum

The maximum sum of the matrix is `n * n * n`, as each of the `n * n` cells will contain the value `n`.

### Operations Required

To fill each row and each column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`, we need `n` operations for the rows and `n` operations for the columns, totaling `2n` operations.

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the provided program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Matrix Initialization**: It initializes a matrix of size `n x n` with each row filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
3. **Sum Calculation**: It calculates the sum of the matrix using the formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`, which is incorrect for the problem at hand. The correct sum should be `n * n * n`.
4. **Output**: It prints the maximum sum and the number of operations (`2n`), followed by the operations themselves. The operations are correctly described as filling each row and each column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

### Correctness of the Program

The program correctly identifies the number of operations needed (`2n`) and the operations themselves. However, the sum calculation is incorrect. The program should calculate the sum as `n * n * n` instead of using the formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`.

### Conclusion

The program is incorrect due to the incorrect sum calculation. The operations described are correct, but the sum reported is not the maximum possible sum.

**Correctness: False**
