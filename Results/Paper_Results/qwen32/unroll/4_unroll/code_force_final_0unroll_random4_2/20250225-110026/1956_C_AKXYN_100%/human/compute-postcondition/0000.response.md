In the provided task, the for loop iterates over the range of an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. The loop body is omitted, so we only need to consider the loop head to determine the necessary state adjustments.

Here is the given state before the loop starts:
- `Each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the n x n matrix filled with zeroes.`
- `The function should handle multiple test cases, with the total number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and the sum of n^2 over all test cases not exceeding 5 * 10^5.`

The for loop statement is:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable, and the `range(int(input()))` part depends on the input `t`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

This state ensures that the loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The value of `n` for each test case is not relevant to the execution of the loop itself, only to what happens inside the loop body (which is not provided).
