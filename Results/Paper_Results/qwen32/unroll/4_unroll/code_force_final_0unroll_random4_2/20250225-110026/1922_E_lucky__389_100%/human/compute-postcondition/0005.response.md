The `print(0)` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of any variables or objects defined in the initial state. The `print` function will output the integer `0` as specified.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `X`, `x`, `subseq_lens`, `mx`), but none of these variables are used in the `print(0)` statement.
2. The `print(0)` statement explicitly prints the integer `0`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(0)` statement is simply `0`.

Output: **0**
