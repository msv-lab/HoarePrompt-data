Postcondition: **`tree` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node in the tree and the corresponding value is a list of nodes that are directly connected to the key node; `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged; `leaves` is a list of nodes from `tree` that have exactly one connection; `dist1` is the shortest distance from `start` to `leaves[0]`; `dist2` is the shortest distance from `start` to `leaves[1]`. Both `dist1` and `dist2` are odd numbers.**
