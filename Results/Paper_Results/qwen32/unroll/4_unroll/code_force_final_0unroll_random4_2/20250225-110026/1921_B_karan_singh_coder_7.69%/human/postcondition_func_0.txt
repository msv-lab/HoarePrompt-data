The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of boxes `n`, a string `s` indicating the current presence of cats in the boxes, and a string `t` indicating the desired presence of cats. It calculates and prints the minimum number of operations needed to transform the current state `s` into the desired state `t`. Each operation can either move a cat from one box to another or remove/add a cat to/from a box.
