Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of boxes, a string `s` of length `n` where each character is '1' if there is a cat in the corresponding box and '0' otherwise, and a string `f` of length `n` where each character is '1' if there should be a cat in the corresponding box and '0' otherwise. The function returns the number of boxes where the presence of a cat matches the desired state specified by the string `f`.**
