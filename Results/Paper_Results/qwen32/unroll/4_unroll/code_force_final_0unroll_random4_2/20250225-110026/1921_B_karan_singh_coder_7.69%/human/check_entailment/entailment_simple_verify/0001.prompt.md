You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In order to test the hypothesis about the cats, the scientists must arrange
the cats in the boxes in a specific way. Of course, they would like to test
the hypothesis and publish a sensational article as quickly as possible,
because they are too engrossed in the next hypothesis about the phone's
battery charge.

Scientists have n boxes in which cats may or may not sit. Let the current
state of the boxes be denoted by the sequence b_1, \dots, b_n : b_i = 1 if
there is a cat in box number i , and b_i = 0 otherwise.

Fortunately, the unlimited production of cats has already been established, so
in one day, the scientists can perform one of the following operations:

  * Take a new cat and place it in a box (for some i such that b_i = 0 , assign b_i = 1 ). 
  * Remove a cat from a box and send it into retirement (for some i such that b_i = 1 , assign b_i = 0 ). 
  * Move a cat from one box to another (for some i, j such that b_i = 1, b_j = 0 , assign b_i = 0, b_j = 1 ). 

It has also been found that some boxes were immediately filled with cats.
Therefore, the scientists know the initial position of the cats in the boxes
s_1, \dots, s_n and the desired position f_1, \dots, f_n .

Due to the large amount of paperwork, the scientists do not have time to solve
this problem. Help them for the sake of science and indicate the minimum
number of days required to test the hypothesis.

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of boxes.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

The third line of each test case contains a string f of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the minimum
number of operations required to obtain the desired position from the initial
position. It can be shown that a solution always exists.

Note

In the first test case, you can first move the cat from the first box to the
fifth, and then remove the cat from the fourth box.

In the second test case, there is nothing to do — the only cat is already
sitting in the correct box.

In the third test case of input data, it takes three days to place a cat in
each box.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To determine the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s` into the desired state `f`, we need to consider the following:

1. **Count the Cats**: Count the number of cats in the initial state `s` (`s1`) and the number of cats in the desired state `f` (`t1`).
2. **Count the Mismatches**: Count the number of positions where the initial state `s` and the desired state `f` differ (`cnt`). This count includes positions where a cat needs to be moved, added, or removed.
3. **Determine Operations**:
    - If the number of cats in the initial state (`s1`) is equal to the number of cats in the desired state (`t1`), then the number of operations required is simply the number of mismatched positions (`cnt`), divided by 2 (since each mismatch can be resolved by moving a cat from one box to another).
    - If the number of cats in the initial state (`s1`) is not equal to the number of cats in the desired state (`t1`), then we need to account for the difference (`d = abs(s1 - t1)`). This difference represents the number of cats that need to be added or removed. The total number of operations required is the number of mismatched positions minus the difference (`cnt - d`), divided by 2 (since the remaining mismatches can be resolved by moving cats), plus the difference itself (`d`).

Let's verify the program logic step-by-step:

- The program reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the number of boxes `n`, the initial state `s`, and the desired state `f`.
- It counts the number of cats in the initial state (`s1`) and the number of cats in the desired state (`t1`).
- It counts the number of mismatched positions (`cnt`).
- If `s1` equals `t1`, it prints `cnt // 2` if there are mismatches, or `0` if there are no mismatches.
- If `s1` does not equal `t1`, it calculates the difference `d` and prints `((cnt - d) // 2) + d`.

The program logic matches the described approach and handles all cases correctly.
