You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` representing the number of distinct types of cards, an integer `k` representing the number of coins, and a list of `n` integers representing the initial count of each card type. It calculates and prints the maximum number of additional cards that can be obtained given the number of coins and the initial availability of each card type.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`. To achieve this, we can buy up to `k` additional cards. 

### Solution Explanation

The solution provided attempts to determine the maximum number of cards of each type that we can have in a permutation by first sorting the list of card counts (`a`). It then tries to equalize the counts by buying additional cards, starting from the smallest count and moving upwards. 

Let's break down the key parts of the code:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads `n` (number of distinct types of cards) and `k` (number of coins).
   - It then reads the list of card counts `a`.

2. **Sorting the Card Counts**
   - The list `a` is sorted. This is done to facilitate the process of equalizing the counts starting from the smallest.

3. **Equalizing Counts**
   - The code iterates through the sorted list and tries to equalize the counts by buying cards.
   - For each index `i`, it checks if it's possible to make all counts up to `i` equal to `a[i + 1]` by spending `k` coins.
   - If it's possible, it updates the remaining coins `k` and the count `r` that we can achieve.
   - If it's not possible to make all counts up to `i` equal to `a[i + 1]`, it calculates how many cards of each type we can have by spending the remaining coins `k`.

4. **Calculating the Result**
   - If there are remaining coins after the loop, it updates the count `r` and calculates the result.
   - If there are no remaining coins, it calculates the result based on the count `r` and the remaining counts that couldn't be equalized.

### Issues with the Solution

The provided solution has a few issues that make it incorrect:

- **Incorrect Calculation of the Result**: The formula used to calculate the result is incorrect. The formula `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y` does not correctly account for the number of permutations of length `n` that can be formed.
- **Handling of Remaining Coins**: The way remaining coins are handled is incorrect. The solution does not correctly distribute the remaining coins to maximize the number of permutations.
- **Equalization Logic**: The logic for equalizing the counts is not optimal. The solution does not ensure that the counts are equalized in a way that maximizes the number of permutations.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified in the solution, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
