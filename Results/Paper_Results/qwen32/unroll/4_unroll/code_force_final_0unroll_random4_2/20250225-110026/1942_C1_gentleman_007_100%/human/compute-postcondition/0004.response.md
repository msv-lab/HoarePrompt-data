The variable `p` is assigned the value `2`. The values of `num`, `prime`, `Highest_Prime`, and `Lowest_Prime` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, where the first two elements are `False` and the rest are `True`; `Highest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, all set to `0`; `Lowest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, all set to `0`; `p` is 2.**
