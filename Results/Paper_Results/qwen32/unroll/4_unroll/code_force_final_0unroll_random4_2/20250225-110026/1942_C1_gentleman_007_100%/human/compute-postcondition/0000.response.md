The code snippet initializes a list named `prime` with `True` values. The length of this list is `num + 1`, where `num` is an integer greater than or equal to 2. This means that `prime` will have `num + 1` elements, all set to `True`.

Output State: **`num` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, all set to `True`.**
