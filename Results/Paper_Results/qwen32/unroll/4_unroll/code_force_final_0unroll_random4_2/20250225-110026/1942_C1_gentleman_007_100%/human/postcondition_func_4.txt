The function constructs an adjacency list representation of a graph with `n` vertices and `m` edges. It initializes an empty adjacency list for each vertex and then iteratively adds edges between pairs of vertices as specified by the function `func_1()`. The final result is a list of `n + 1` lists, where each list at index `i` contains all vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i`.
