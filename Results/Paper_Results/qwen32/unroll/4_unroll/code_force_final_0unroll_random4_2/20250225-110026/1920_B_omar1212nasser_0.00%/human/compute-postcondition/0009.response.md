Output State: **The program returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, where `pos` is a list containing `removals + 1` elements, with the first element being `s - 2 * n` and subsequent elements calculated similarly.**

Here, `s` is the sum of the first `len(elements) - removals` elements of `elements`, and `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements minus the sum of the last `removals` elements, or 0 if an `IndexError` occurred.
