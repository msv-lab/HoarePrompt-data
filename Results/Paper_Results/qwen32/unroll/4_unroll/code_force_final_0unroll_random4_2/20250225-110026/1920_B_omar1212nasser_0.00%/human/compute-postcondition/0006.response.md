The code appends the value of `s - 2 * n` to the list `pos`. Therefore, the list `pos` will now contain this new value. The values of `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, `s`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers, and `elements` is a list of integers. It is not the case that `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3; `pos` is a list containing the single element `s - 2 * n`; `s` is the sum of `elements`; `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements`.**
