### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summary to determine if the program is correct according to the problem description and the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Alice's Move**: Alice can remove up to `k` elements to maximize the sum of the remaining elements.
2. **Bob's Move**: Bob can multiply up to `x` elements by -1 to minimize the sum of the remaining elements.
3. **Objective**: Find the final sum after both play optimally.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1`**: Handles the input and output for multiple test cases.
2. **`func_2`**: Attempts to calculate the optimal sum after Alice's and Bob's moves.

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_2` is supposed to calculate the maximum possible sum after Alice and Bob's moves.
- It handles a specific case where `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3` by returning 0.
- For other cases, it calculates potential sums by iteratively removing elements and adjusting the sum based on Bob's moves.

#### Issues in the Provided Code:
1. **Hardcoded Case**: The hardcoded case for `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3` returning 0 is incorrect and does not generalize.
2. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**: The logic for calculating the sum after Bob's moves is flawed. The code subtracts twice the sum of the `x` largest elements, which does not correctly simulate Bob flipping the `x` smallest elements.

#### Correct Approach:
- **Alice's Move**: Sort the array and remove the `k` smallest elements.
- **Bob's Move**: After Alice's removal, sort the remaining array and flip the `x` smallest elements.

#### Correct Implementation:
Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        # Alice removes the k smallest elements
        remaining = a[k:]
        # Bob flips the x smallest elements
        remaining[:x] = [-elem for elem in remaining[:x]]
        print(sum(remaining))

# Call the function to execute the solution
func_1()
```

#### Evaluation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob's moves. The hardcoded case and incorrect sum calculation logic lead to incorrect results in most scenarios.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
