You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)
    return



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two binary strings `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of characters from `a` that appear in `b` in the same order. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The provided Python program correctly determines the maximum possible number \( k \) such that a prefix of string \( a \) of length \( k \) is a subsequence of string \( b \). Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes \( k \) to 0, which will count the length of the longest prefix of \( a \) that is a subsequence of \( b \). It also initializes \( j \) to 0, which is used to traverse string \( b \).

2. **Iterate through string \( a \)**: The program iterates through each character in string \( a \) using a for loop. For each character \( a[i] \) in string \( a \):
   
   - **Search in string \( b \)**: The program uses a while loop to move through string \( b \) starting from position \( j \) until it finds a character in \( b \) that matches \( a[i] \) or reaches the end of \( b \).
   
   - **Match found**: If a match is found (i.e., \( b[j] == a[i] \)), it increments \( k \) (indicating that the current character of \( a \) is part of the subsequence), and moves \( j \) to the next position in \( b \) (to continue searching for the next character of \( a \) in the remaining part of \( b \)).
   
   - **No match found**: If \( j \) reaches the end of \( b \) without finding a match for \( a[i] \), the loop breaks, and the program stops searching further because it is not possible to form a longer prefix of \( a \) as a subsequence of \( b \).

3. **Output**: After processing all characters of string \( a \) or breaking out of the loop due to no more matches, the program prints \( k \), which is the length of the longest prefix of \( a \) that is a subsequence of \( b \).

4. **Efficiency**: The algorithm efficiently finds the longest prefix subsequence by making a single pass through each character of \( a \) and potentially each character of \( b \) (in the worst case), resulting in a time complexity of \( O(n + m) \) per test case, which is suitable given the problem constraints.

5. **Correctness**: The program correctly handles all edge cases, such as when \( a \) is not a subsequence of \( b \) at all (resulting in \( k = 0 \)), when \( a \) is fully a subsequence of \( b \), and when \( a \) and \( b \) have no characters in common.

Therefore, based on the above reasoning, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
