The code snippet `b = input()` reads a new input from the user and assigns it to the variable `b`. This input is expected to be the binary string `b` as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, representing the lengths of binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively; `a` is a binary string read from the input; `b` is a binary string read from the input.**
