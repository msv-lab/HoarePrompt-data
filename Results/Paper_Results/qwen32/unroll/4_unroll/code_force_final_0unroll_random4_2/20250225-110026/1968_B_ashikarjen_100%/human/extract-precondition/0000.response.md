Precondition: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are three lines: two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the lengths of binary strings a and b, respectively. The following two lines contain the binary strings a and b of lengths n and m. The sum of all n and the sum of all m across all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
