The provided code snippet processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of a single integer `l`, presumably representing the side length of a square. The code calculates a value `s` based on this side length and prints it. The value of `n` is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the while loop until it reaches 0.

Let's break down the code's impact on the variables:
- `n` is initialized to the integer input `t` and is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the while loop.
- `s` is recalculated for each test case and printed. The calculation involves integer division and modulo operations on `l`.

The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and for each of the `t` test cases, there is an integer `l` representing the side length of a square.

Given the code's logic, after processing all test cases, `n` will be 0. The variable `s` will hold the value calculated for the last test case, but since `s` is recalculated in each iteration, its final value is not relevant to the overall state unless we are considering the last test case specifically.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is 0; `s` holds the value calculated for the last test case; `l` holds the value of the side length from the last test case.**

In natural language: After processing all test cases, `n` is 0, and `s` holds the value calculated for the last test case based on the side length `l` of the last square. The value of `t` remains as it was initially, representing the total number of test cases.
