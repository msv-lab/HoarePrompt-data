You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it checks if a given string `c` is identical to either of two other strings `a` or `b`. If `c` is identical to either, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if every character in `c` is present in either `a` or `b`. If all characters in `c` are found in `a` or `b`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Template Matching Logic**: The code does not correctly check if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match `t`, while `c` does not match `t`. The code only checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b` and if `c` has any character not present in `a` or `b`, which is not the correct approach.

2. **Template Conditions**: The problem requires that for each position `i` in the template `t`:
   - If `t[i]` is lowercase, then `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be equal to `t[i]`, and `c[i]` must not be equal to `t[i]`.
   - If `t[i]` is uppercase, then `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`, and `c[i]` must be equal to the lowercase version of `t[i]`.

3. **Example Case Failure**: Consider the following test case:
   ```
   1
   3
   acc
   abd
   abc
   ```
   According to the problem description, the correct answer should be "NO" because there is no template `t` that satisfies the conditions for all positions. However, the provided code will output "YES" because it checks if any character in `c` is not in `a` or `b`, which is not the correct logic.

To fix the program, you need to iterate over each position and construct a template `t` that satisfies the conditions for `a` and `b` while failing for `c`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        for j in range(slength):
            if a[j] == b[j]:
                # If a[j] == b[j], then t[j] must be a[j] (lowercase) and c[j] must be different
                if c[j] == a[j]:
                    no = False
                    break
            else:
                # If a[j] != b[j], then t[j] must be A (uppercase) and c[j] must be a[j] or b[j]
                if c[j] == a[j] or c[j] == b[j]:
                    no = False
                    break
        if no:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage
# func()
```

This corrected version checks each position in the strings to ensure that a valid template `t` can be constructed.
