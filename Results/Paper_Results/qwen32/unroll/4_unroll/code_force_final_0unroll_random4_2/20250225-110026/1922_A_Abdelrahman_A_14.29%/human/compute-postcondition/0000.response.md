The code snippet `tests = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `tests`. This integer represents the number of test cases, `t`, and it does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, or `c`, which are described as being specific to each test case.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is an input integer, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
