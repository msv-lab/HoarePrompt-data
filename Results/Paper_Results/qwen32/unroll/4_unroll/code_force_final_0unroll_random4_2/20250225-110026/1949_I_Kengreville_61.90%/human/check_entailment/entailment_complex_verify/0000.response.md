### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by using a depth-first search (DFS) to explore connected components of disks that are tangent to each other. The goal is to determine if it's possible to adjust the radii such that the sum of all radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency and no overlap.

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Global Variables:**
   The variables `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` are defined in `func_1` but used in `dfs` without being passed as arguments. This is a significant issue because it makes the code difficult to understand and maintain, and it can lead to undefined behavior if `dfs` is called outside of `func_1`.

2. **DFS Logic:**
   The DFS logic in `dfs` seems aimed at checking if there's a way to adjust the radii such that the sum decreases, but the implementation is incomplete and incorrect. The logic for adjusting the coefficients and checking tangency conditions is not correctly implemented. Specifically, the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are updated in a way that does not directly address the requirement to ensure the sum of the radii strictly decreases.

3. **Tangency Check:**
   The condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` correctly checks if two disks are tangent. However, the code does not correctly handle the adjustment of radii to ensure the sum strictly decreases.

4. **Sum Decrease Check:**
   The code does not ensure that the sum of the radii strictly decreases. It only checks if there is a way to adjust the radii such that the disks remain tangent and do not overlap, but it does not verify the sum of the radii.

#### Example Case Where the Code Fails:

Consider the following input:
```
4
0 0 1
2 0 1
4 0 1
6 0 1
```
The disks are tangent to each other in a line. The code should output `NO` because there is no way to adjust the radii such that the sum of the radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency and no overlap. However, the current code might incorrectly output `YES` due to the incomplete logic.

#### Annotations Analysis:

The annotations provide a detailed state of the program at key points. However, they do not address the core logic issues mentioned above. The annotations show that the code performs DFS to explore connected components and updates coefficients, but they do not validate that the sum of the radii strictly decreases.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues with the code and the example where it fails, the correctness of the program is `False`.

Final: **False**
