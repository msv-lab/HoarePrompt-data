The given initial state describes various lists and variables that are used in a program, which includes a depth-first search (DFS) traversal. However, the specific values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` are not provided. The only information we have is that at least one DFS traversal resulted in a non-zero sum of `coef1` values for the nodes visited.

The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or lists described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **YES**
