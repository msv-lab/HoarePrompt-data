Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1`. Here, `n` is an integer representing the number of disks, with constraints 1 <= n <= 1000. `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers where `x[i]` and `y[i]` represent the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk, and `r[i]` represents the radius of the i-th disk, with constraints 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9. `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to `False` for each disk, and `coef0` and `coef1` are lists initialized to `None` for each disk. The function does not return any value explicitly, but it likely modifies the `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` lists based on the given disks' properties.**
