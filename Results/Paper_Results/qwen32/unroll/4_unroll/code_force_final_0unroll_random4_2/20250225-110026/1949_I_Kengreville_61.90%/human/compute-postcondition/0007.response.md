Functionality: **The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search starting from a given disk index `i`. It marks the disk and all disks directly connected to it as visited, adds their indices to the `nodes` list, and updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists with coefficients related to the constraints on the radii of the disks in the connected component.**
