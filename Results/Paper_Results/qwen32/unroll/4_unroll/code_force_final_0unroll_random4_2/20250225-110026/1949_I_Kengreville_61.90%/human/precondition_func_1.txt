i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the number of disks. x, y, and r are lists of integers representing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii of the disks, respectively. visited is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited. nodes is a list that will store the indices of the disks that are part of the current connected component. coef0 and coef1 are lists of values that will be used to store coefficients for the system of equations representing the constraints on the radii.
