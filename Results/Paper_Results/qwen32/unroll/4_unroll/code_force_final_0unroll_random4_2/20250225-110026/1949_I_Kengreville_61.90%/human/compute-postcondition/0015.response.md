Postcondition: **`n` is the integer value provided by the input, `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of `True` values for all indices that were visited during the `dfs` traversals, `coef0` is a list of integers with length `n` with values assigned based on the `dfs` function, `coef1` is a list of integers with length `n` with values assigned based on the `dfs` function, `nodes` is an empty list, `ok` is `False` since no `dfs` traversal resulted in a non-zero sum of `coef1` values for the nodes visited.**
