You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

#Function 1:

    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n

    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef0[i] = 0
            coef1[i] = 1
            nodes = []
            dfs(i)
            c0 = 0
            c1 = 0
            for j in nodes:
                c0 += coef0[j]
                c1 += coef1[j]
            ok = ok or c1 != 0
    if ok:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

#Function 2:
def dfs(i):
    if not visited[i]:
        visited[i] = True
        nodes.append(i)
        for j in range(n):
            dx = x[i] - x[j]
            dy = y[i] - y[j]
            if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
                coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
                coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
                dfs(j)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search starting from a given disk index `i`. It marks the disk and all disks directly connected to it as visited, adds their indices to the `nodes` list, and updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists with coefficients related to the constraints on the radii of the disks in the connected component.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
The provided Python program attempts to solve the problem by using a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the connections between disks that are tangent to each other. The program then checks if it is possible to adjust the radii according to the conditions specified.

However, there are several issues with the program that indicate it is incorrect:

1. **Global Variables**: The variables `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, `nodes`, and `n` are used within the `dfs` function, but they are not defined within it. These variables are local to `func_1` and should be passed as arguments to `dfs` or declared as global within `dfs`.

2. **DFS Logic**: The DFS logic is intended to check if there is a way to adjust the radii such that the sum of the radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency. However, the logic used in the DFS does not directly address the problem of decreasing the sum of the radii. The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` seem to be used to determine the feasibility of the radii changes, but the logic for adjusting the radii is not correctly implemented.

3. **Condition Check**: The condition `ok = ok or c1 != 0` is used to determine if it is possible to adjust the radii. However, this condition is not sufficient to ensure that the sum of the radii strictly decreases. The program does not account for the actual values of the radii or the possibility of adjusting them in a way that decreases the sum.

4. **Output**: The program outputs "YES" if `ok` is true, which is determined by the condition `c1 != 0`. This condition does not guarantee that the sum of the radii will strictly decrease, which is a requirement of the problem.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
