The provided Python program attempts to solve the problem by using a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the connections between disks that are tangent to each other. The program then checks if it is possible to adjust the radii according to the conditions specified.

However, there are several issues with the program that indicate it is incorrect:

1. **Global Variables**: The variables `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, `nodes`, and `n` are used within the `dfs` function, but they are not defined within it. These variables are local to `func_1` and should be passed as arguments to `dfs` or declared as global within `dfs`.

2. **DFS Logic**: The DFS logic is intended to check if there is a way to adjust the radii such that the sum of the radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency. However, the logic used in the DFS does not directly address the problem of decreasing the sum of the radii. The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` seem to be used to determine the feasibility of the radii changes, but the logic for adjusting the radii is not correctly implemented.

3. **Condition Check**: The condition `ok = ok or c1 != 0` is used to determine if it is possible to adjust the radii. However, this condition is not sufficient to ensure that the sum of the radii strictly decreases. The program does not account for the actual values of the radii or the possibility of adjusting them in a way that decreases the sum.

4. **Output**: The program outputs "YES" if `ok` is true, which is determined by the condition `c1 != 0`. This condition does not guarantee that the sum of the radii will strictly decrease, which is a requirement of the problem.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
