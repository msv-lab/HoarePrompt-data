The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The initial state provides constraints for these variables. After executing the code, the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are set according to the input, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from input, where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**
