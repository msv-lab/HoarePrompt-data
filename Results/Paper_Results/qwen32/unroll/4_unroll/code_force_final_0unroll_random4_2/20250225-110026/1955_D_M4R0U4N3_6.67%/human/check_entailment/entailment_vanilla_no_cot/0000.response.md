Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases. The issue arises from the use of sets to track elements in the subarray. Sets do not account for the frequency of elements, which is necessary for this problem because the arrays `a` and `b` can contain duplicate elements.

To fix this, we should use `Counter` from the `collections` module to keep track of the frequency of elements in the current subarray of `a` and compare it with the frequency of elements in `b`. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b_count = Counter(b)
        a_count = Counter(a[:m])
        matches = sum(min(a_count[x], b_count[x]) for x in b_count)
        ans = 1 if matches >= k else 0
        for r in range(m, n):
            old = a[r - m]
            new = a[r]
            a_count[old] -= 1
            if a_count[old] == 0:
                del a_count[old]
            a_count[new] += 1
            matches -= min(a_count[old], b_count[old]) - min(a_count[old] + 1, b_count[old])
            matches += min(a_count[new], b_count[new]) - min(a_count[new] - 1, b_count[new])
            if matches >= k:
                ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version uses `Counter` to keep track of the frequency of elements in both the current subarray of `a` and the array `b`. It then calculates the number of matching elements by summing the minimum frequencies of each element in the two counters. As the window slides over `a`, it updates the counts and the number of matches accordingly.
