To determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the provided Python code and understand its behavior for each test case.

The code processes `t` test cases. For each test case:
1. It reads integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.
2. It reads a list `a` of `n` integers.
3. It reads a list `todo` of `m` integers.
4. It initializes two sets, `done` and `extra`.
5. It processes the first `m` elements of `a` to populate `done` and `extra` sets.
6. It checks if the size of `done` is at least `k` and sets `ans` to 1 if true, otherwise 0.
7. It then slides a window of size `m` across the rest of the list `a` (from `m` to `n`), updating the `done` and `extra` sets accordingly.
8. It increments `ans` for each position where the size of `done` is at least `k`.
9. Finally, it prints `ans`.

The output for each test case is the value of `ans`, which indicates how many positions in the sliding window of size `m` across the list `a` have at least `k` elements that are in the initial `todo` list.

Since the code processes each test case independently and the state of variables is reset for each test case, the final output state is simply the sequence of printed values for each test case.

Output State: **The output state consists of `t` integers, each representing the result `ans` for the corresponding test case.**
