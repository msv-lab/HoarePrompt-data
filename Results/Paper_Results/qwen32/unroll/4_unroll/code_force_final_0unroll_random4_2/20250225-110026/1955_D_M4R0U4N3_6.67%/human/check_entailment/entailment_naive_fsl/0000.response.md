Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the elements in array `b` are not unique. Specifically, the use of sets (`todo`, `done`, `extra`) does not account for the multiplicity of elements in `b`. This can lead to incorrect counts of matching elements in the subsegments of `a`.

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
5 3 2
1 2 2 1 1
1 2 2
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

Explanation:
- Subsegment [1, 2, 2] matches [1, 2, 2] (all elements match, so it's good).
- Subsegment [2, 2, 1] matches [1, 2, 2] (two elements match, so it's good).
- Subsegment [2, 1, 1] does not match [1, 2, 2] (only one element matches, so it's not good).
- Subsegment [1, 1, 1] does not match [1, 2, 2] (only one element matches, so it's not good).

However, the program will incorrectly identify the third subsegment as good because it only checks for the presence of elements in sets, not their counts.

To fix this, the program should use `Counter` from the `collections` module to keep track of the counts of elements in `b` and the current subsegment of `a`. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b_counter = Counter(b)
        current_counter = Counter(a[:m])
        matches = sum((current_counter & b_counter).values())
        ans = 1 if matches >= k else 0
        for r in range(m, n):
            old = a[r - m]
            new = a[r]
            current_counter[old] -= 1
            if current_counter[old] == 0:
                del current_counter[old]
            current_counter[new] += 1
            matches = sum((current_counter & b_counter).values())
            if matches >= k:
                ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version uses `Counter` to accurately track the counts of elements in `b` and the current subsegment of `a`, ensuring that the number of matching elements is correctly calculated.
