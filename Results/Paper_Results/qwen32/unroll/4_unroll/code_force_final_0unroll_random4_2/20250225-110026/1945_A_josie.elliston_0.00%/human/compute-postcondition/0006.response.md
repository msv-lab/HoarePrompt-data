Functionality: **The function accepts two non-negative integer parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`. It returns `None` in Case_1. In Case_2, it returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3. This case applies if `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of the remainder when `extroverts` is divided by 3 and `universals` is 3 or greater, ensuring the result is at least 2.**
