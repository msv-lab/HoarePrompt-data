`a` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `t`, `n`, and `path` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `path` is a string of n characters where each character is either '.', '@', or '*', with the first character guaranteed to be '.'; `a` is an input integer.**
