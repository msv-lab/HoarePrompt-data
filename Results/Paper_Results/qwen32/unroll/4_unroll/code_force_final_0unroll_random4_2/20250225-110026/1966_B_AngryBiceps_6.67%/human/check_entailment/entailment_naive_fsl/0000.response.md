Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the described operations. The program makes incorrect assumptions about the conditions under which it is possible to change the colors of the grid.

Let's analyze the logic in the program:
1. The program reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the grid (n and m) and the grid itself.
3. It constructs two strings: `first_row`, which contains the first character of each row, and `last_row`, which contains the last character of each row.
4. The program then checks two conditions:
   - If all characters in the first row are the same and the first row is not equal to the last row, it prints "NO".
   - If all characters in `first_row` are the same and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES".

However, these conditions are not sufficient to determine whether the entire grid can be made the same color. The program does not check if there exists a way to use the operations to make all squares the same color. It only checks specific conditions about the first and last rows, which is not comprehensive enough.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following grid:
```
2 2
WB
BW
```
According to the program, this should print "YES" because the first and last rows are not the same, but all characters in the first row are the same (in terms of being different from the last row). However, it is impossible to make all squares the same color using the described operations because the 'W' and 'B' are diagonally opposite and there is no way to select two squares of the same color to change the entire grid to one color.

### Correct Approach:
To determine if it is possible to make all squares the same color, one would need to check if there exists a way to use the operations to change the grid. A simpler and correct approach is to check if there is at least one 'W' and one 'B' in the grid. If both 'W' and 'B' are present, it is impossible to make all squares the same color. If only one of them is present, then it is possible.

Here's a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        has_W = any('W' in row for row in grid)
        has_B = any('B' in row for row in grid)
        if has_W and has_B:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This corrected version checks for the presence of both 'W' and 'B' in the grid and prints "NO" if both are present, otherwise it prints "YES".
