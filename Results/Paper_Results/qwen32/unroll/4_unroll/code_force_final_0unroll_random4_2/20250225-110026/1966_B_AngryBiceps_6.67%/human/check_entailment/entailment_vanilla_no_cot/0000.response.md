Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color based on the given operations. The logic in the program is flawed and does not account for all possible configurations of the grid.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Checking Only First and Last Rows/Columns:**
   - The program checks if all characters in the first row are the same and compares it with the last row. Similarly, it checks the first and last columns.
   - However, this is not sufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made the same color. There could be configurations where the first and last rows or columns are the same, but other rows or columns have different patterns that cannot be resolved by the allowed operations.

2. **Ignoring Internal Patterns:**
   - The program does not consider the internal patterns within the grid. For example, a grid might have alternating rows or columns of different colors that cannot be resolved by the operations described.

3. **Incorrect Logic for "NO":**
   - The program outputs "NO" only if the first row is uniform and different from the last row, or if the first column is uniform and different from the last column.
   - This is not a comprehensive check for the problem's requirements.

### Correct Approach:

To determine if the entire grid can be made the same color, you need to check if there exists a color (either 'W' or 'B') such that all subrectangles of that color can be expanded to cover the entire grid. This means that there should not be a configuration where there are two different colors that are not adjacent in a way that allows one to be expanded to cover the other.

A correct solution would involve checking if the grid can be partitioned into subrectangles of the same color such that these subrectangles can be expanded to cover the entire grid. This is a more complex problem and typically involves checking for connected components of the same color.

Here's a corrected version of the program that checks if the entire grid can be made the same color:

```python
def can_make_uniform(grid, n, m):
    # Check if the grid can be made uniform
    # We need to check if there is a single color that can be expanded to cover the entire grid
    # This can be done by checking if there is a single connected component of the same color
    
    # Check if the grid is already uniform
    first_color = grid[0][0]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if grid[i][j] != first_color:
                return False
    return True

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
        if can_make_uniform(grid, n, m):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage
# func()
```

This program checks if the entire grid can be made the same color by ensuring that all cells in the grid have the same color. If they do, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". However, this is a simplified check and may not cover all edge cases as described in the problem statement. A more comprehensive approach would involve checking for connected components of the same color.
