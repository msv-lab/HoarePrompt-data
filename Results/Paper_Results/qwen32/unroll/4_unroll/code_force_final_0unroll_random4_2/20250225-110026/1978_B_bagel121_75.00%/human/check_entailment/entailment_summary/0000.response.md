### Reasoning:

The program aims to compute the maximum profit Bob can achieve by selling `n` buns under the given promotion rules. The logic used in the program is as follows:

1. **Input Parsing**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of buns), `a` (usual price of a bun), and `b` (price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price).

2. **Decision Making**:
   - If `a` (usual price) is greater than or equal to `b` (modified price of the first bun), Bob should not sell any buns at the modified price because it would not be beneficial. Therefore, he should sell all buns at the usual price `a`. The profit in this case is `n * a`.
   - If `a` is less than `b`, Bob should sell the first `k` buns at the modified price, where `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`. The reason is that the modified price decreases by 1 for each subsequent bun sold, and it only makes sense to sell buns at the modified price while the price is higher than the usual price `a`. The number of buns sold at the modified price cannot exceed `b - a + 1` because after that, the price would drop below `a` and it would be better to sell them at `a`.

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`. This formula calculates the sum of the series from `b` down to `b - k + 1`.
   - The profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a` is `p2 = (n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of `ans` and `p2`.

4. **Output**: For each test case, the program prints the computed total profit.

### Verification:

The provided program logic aligns with the problem description and the examples given. Let's verify the first example:

- **Example 1**: `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
  - Since `a < b`, Bob should sell up to `k = min(b - a + 1, n) = min(2, 4) = 2` buns at the modified price.
  - Profit from the first 2 buns: `ans = (5 + 4) / 2 * 2 = 9 / 2 * 2 = 9 / 1 = 9 / 1 = 9 / 1 = 9`.
  - Profit from the remaining 2 buns: `p2 = (4 - 2) * 4 = 8`.
  - Total profit: `9 + 8 = 17`.

The program correctly computes the maximum profit for each test case as per the examples provided.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given promotion rules.

**Correctness: True**
