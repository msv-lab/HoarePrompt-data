You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    7
    
    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a >= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)
            ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
            p2 = (n - k) * a
            print(ans + p2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. Specifically, it computes the maximum possible sum of `n` integers where each integer is either `a` or `b`, with the constraint that no more than `b - a + 1` of the integers can be `b`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the calculation of the maximum profit for all possible values of `k`. Specifically, the code calculates the maximum profit by fixing `k` to `min(b - a + 1, n)`, but this does not guarantee the optimal solution. The optimal `k` should be determined by comparing the total profit for different values of `k`.

Let's consider an example to illustrate this:

Input:
```
1
5 5 9
```

According to the problem statement, the optimal solution is to sell all buns at the modified price, which gives a profit of `9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35`.

However, the provided code calculates `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n) = min(9 - 5 + 1, 5) = 5`. This is correct in this specific case, but let's consider another example:

Input:
```
1
5 5 6
```

The optimal solution here is to sell the first 2 buns at the modified price and the remaining 3 buns at the usual price. This gives a profit of `6 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 26`.

However, the provided code calculates `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n) = min(6 - 5 + 1, 5) = 2`. This is correct in this specific case, but the code does not verify that this `k` is indeed optimal by comparing with other possible values of `k`.

To ensure the correctness, the code should iterate over all possible values of `k` from 0 to `n` and calculate the total profit for each `k`, then choose the maximum profit. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(n + 1):
            profit = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k) if k > 0 else 0
            profit += (n - k) * a
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        print(max_profit)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected code ensures that the maximum profit is calculated by considering all possible values of `k`.
