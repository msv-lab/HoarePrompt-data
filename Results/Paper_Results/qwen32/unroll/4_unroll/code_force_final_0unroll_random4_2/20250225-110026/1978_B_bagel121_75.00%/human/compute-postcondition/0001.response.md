In the provided for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. The value of `t` determines how many times the loop will execute. Since `_` does not influence the execution of the loop, we only need to ensure that `t` is set to a value that allows the loop to execute the desired number of times.

Given that `t` is already assigned the value of the input integer and is within the range 1 to 10^4, the loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. Therefore, no adjustment to `t` is necessary to ensure the loop executes. However, we should explicitly state that `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
