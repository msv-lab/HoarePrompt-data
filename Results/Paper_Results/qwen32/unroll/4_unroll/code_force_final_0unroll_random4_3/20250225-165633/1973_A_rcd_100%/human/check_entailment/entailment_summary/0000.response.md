### Reasoning:

1. **Sum of Scores Check**:
   - The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because the total points from all games must be even (since each game awards a total of 2 points, either as 2-0 or 1-1).
   - This is correct because in any valid set of games, the total points awarded must be even.

2. **Maximum Score Check**:
   - If the sum of the scores is even, the program then checks if the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores `p1 + p2`. If this condition is true, it prints `p1 + p2` as the maximum number of draws.
   - This is correct because if `p3` is at least `p1 + p2`, it implies that all the games involving the player with score `p3` could have ended in draws against the other two players, and the remaining points could have been distributed among `p1` and `p2` in a way that respects their scores.

3. **Balancing Scores**:
   - If the above conditions are not met, the program enters a loop to find the maximum number of draws.
   - It initializes `x` to 0 (representing the number of games where `p1` lost) and `y` to `p3` (representing the number of games where `p3` won).
   - It then iterates, adjusting `x` and `y` to find a valid distribution of wins and draws that matches the given scores.
   - The loop condition `y >= x` ensures that the number of games where `p3` won is not less than the number of games where `p1` lost.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the remaining points for `p1` after accounting for losses (`p1 - x`) can be distributed among the remaining games in a way that matches `p2`'s score after accounting for wins (`p2 - y`).
   - If a valid distribution is found, it prints the total number of draws, which is `p1 - x + p3`.
   - If no valid distribution is found after the loop, it prints `p3` as the maximum number of draws.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws based on the given scores, and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement. The execution summary aligns with the program's behavior.

**Correctness: True**
