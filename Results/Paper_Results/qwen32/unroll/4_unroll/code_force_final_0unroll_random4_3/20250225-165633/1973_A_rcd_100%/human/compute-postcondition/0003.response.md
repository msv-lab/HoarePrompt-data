Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` (where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. The function processes `t` such test cases (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and returns the result for each test case.**
