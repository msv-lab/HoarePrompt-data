You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by simulating the Kraken's attacks on the ships. It handles specific edge cases by directly printing the expected results for given values of `n` and `k`. However, this approach is not a general solution and is based on hardcoded values for certain test cases. 

The main logic in the program is in the `else` block, which tries to simulate the Kraken's attack pattern by alternating between the first and last ships until either all ships are sunk or the number of attacks (`k`) is exhausted. However, this logic has several issues:

1. **Handling of `k`**: The program assumes that `k` will always be an even number of attacks when alternating between the first and last ships. If `k` is odd, it performs one additional attack on the first ship after the loop. This part is correct, but it does not handle the case where the number of attacks is large enough to sink all ships.

2. **Efficiency**: The program attempts to simulate each attack one by one, which is inefficient for large values of `k` (up to \(10^{15}\)). This approach would result in a time complexity of \(O(k)\), which is not feasible for the given constraints.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles some specific edge cases with hardcoded results, but it does not provide a general solution for all possible inputs.

4. **Error Handling**: The `try-except` block is used to catch exceptions, but it is not clear why it is needed or how it handles the situation where all ships are sunk before `k` attacks are completed.

5. **General Solution**: The program does not provide a general solution for all possible values of `n` and `k`. It should instead calculate the number of ships sunk based on the total number of attacks and the durability of the ships.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it does not provide a general solution for all possible inputs and is inefficient for large values of `k`.
