### Reasoning:

The provided code is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum possible number \( k \) such that a prefix of string \( a \) of length \( k \) is a subsequence of string \( b \). The logic used in the function `func_1` is as follows:

1. **Initialization**: The function reads the lengths of the two binary strings \( a \) and \( b \) (denoted by \( n \) and \( m \) respectively) and then reads the strings themselves.
2. **Iterating through string \( a \)**: It initializes two pointers, \( k \) and \( j \), to 0. The variable \( k \) will keep track of the length of the longest prefix of \( a \) that is a subsequence of \( b \), and \( j \) will be used to traverse the string \( b \).
3. **Checking subsequence condition**: For each character in \( a \), it uses a while loop to find the corresponding character in \( b \) starting from the current position \( j \). If a match is found, it increments both \( k \) and \( j \). If no match is found (i.e., \( j \) exceeds the length of \( b \)), it breaks out of the loop.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the value of \( k \), which represents the length of the longest prefix of \( a \) that is a subsequence of \( b \).

The code correctly implements the logic to find the longest prefix of \( a \) that is a subsequence of \( b \). It efficiently handles the constraints provided in the problem statement, including the large possible sizes of \( n \) and \( m \).

### Correctness:

Based on the provided code and the problem description, the function correctly determines the maximum possible \( k \) for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
