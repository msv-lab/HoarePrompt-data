The code snippet provided initializes a variable `j` to 0. The initial state of the other variables (`a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, and `k`) remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initialization of `j` while keeping the other variables as they were.

Output State: **`a` is the input string, `b` is the new input string, `n` is the length of `a`, `m` is the length of the new input string, `k` is 0, `j` is 0.**
