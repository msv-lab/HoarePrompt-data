Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The task is to rearrange the elements of the array to maximize the beauty, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. The current implementation sorts the array and prints it, but it does not compute the beauty of the rearranged array.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
2 1 3
```
The program will output: `1 2 3`, which is the sorted array, but it should output the maximum beauty, which is `2` (as explained in the problem statement).

The correct approach would be to sort the array and then compute the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        beauty = sum(ar[i] - ar[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)

func()
```

This corrected version sorts the array and calculates the beauty as required by the problem statement.
