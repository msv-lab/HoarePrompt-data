Reasoning:  
The given program does not correctly solve the problem described. The task is to find the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, the array should be sorted in either ascending or descending order. However, the program sorts the array in ascending order and prints the sorted array elements, which does not provide the maximum beauty value. The program should calculate the beauty of the sorted (or inversely sorted) array and print that value instead of the sorted array elements.

Therefore, the program's output does not match the expected output as per the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
