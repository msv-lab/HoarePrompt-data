Reasoning:  
The given program does not solve the problem correctly. The task is to find the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. The maximum beauty can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order, as this will maximize the differences between consecutive elements. However, the provided program sorts the array and then prints the sorted array as a string, not the calculated beauty. 

To solve the problem correctly, after sorting the array, we should compute the sum of the differences between consecutive elements and print that sum.

Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        beauty = sum(ar[i] - ar[i - 1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)

func()
```

Correctness: **False**
