### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation: splitting the array into two parts and swapping them. The key insight here is that the array can be rotated to achieve a sorted order if and only if there exists a point in the array where it can be split into two parts such that the second part followed by the first part is sorted.

The provided solution uses a clever trick to check this condition. It concatenates the array with itself (`concatenated_a = a + a`) and then checks if any subarray of length `n` (the original array length) within this concatenated array is sorted. If such a subarray exists, it indicates that the original array can be rotated to become sorted.

Let's break down the steps of the provided solution:

1. **Concatenation**: The array `a` is concatenated with itself to form `concatenated_a`. This allows us to easily check for any possible rotation of the array.
2. **Checking Subarrays**: The code then iterates over all possible starting points of subarrays of length `n` in `concatenated_a` and checks if any of these subarrays match the sorted version of `a`.
3. **Output**: If a matching subarray is found, it returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No".

This approach works because any rotation of the array can be represented as a subarray of length `n` in the concatenated array `concatenated_a`.

### Correctness:

The provided solution correctly implements the logic needed to determine if the array can be sorted by rotating it. It efficiently checks all possible rotations by leveraging array concatenation and subarray comparison.

Therefore, the correctness of the solution is:

Correctness: **True**
