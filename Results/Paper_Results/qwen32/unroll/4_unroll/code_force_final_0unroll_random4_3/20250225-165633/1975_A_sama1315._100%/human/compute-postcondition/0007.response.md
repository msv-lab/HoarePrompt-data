To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand what the loop does and how it modifies the state.

The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`. In each iteration:
1. It reads the value of `n` from `data[idx]`.
2. It increments `idx` by 1.
3. It reads the next `n` integers from `data` starting at `data[idx]` and converts them into a list `a`.
4. It increments `idx` by `n`.
5. It calls `func_1(a)` with the list `a` and appends the result to the `results` list.

After the loop completes, the variables `idx` and `results` will be updated. The variable `a` will hold the last list of integers processed in the loop, and `n` will hold the last number of integers processed. The variable `t` will remain unchanged as it is only used to control the number of iterations.

Output State: **`a` is the last list of integers processed in the loop, `data` remains unchanged, `idx` is incremented by the total number of integers processed plus `t`, `t` remains the same, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(a)` for each iteration.**
