Reasoning:
The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing any number of prefix-suffix swaps. The provided solution consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes an array `a` and checks if any contiguous subsequence of length `n` in the doubled list `a + a` matches the sorted version of `a`. If such a subsequence is found, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'. The logic behind this is that if the array can be split into two parts and swapped to become sorted, then the sorted array must appear as a contiguous subsequence in the doubled array.

`func_2` handles the input reading and output printing for multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and collects the results to print them.

However, the output hints for `func_1` indicate that it always returns 'No', which contradicts the expected behavior based on the problem statement and the provided examples. This discrepancy suggests that the implementation of `func_1` might not be correct as per the problem description.

For instance, in the second test case of the provided example, the array `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]` can be sorted by performing the prefix-suffix swaps as described in the problem statement. The function should return 'Yes' for this case, but the output hints suggest it returns 'No'.

Therefore, the current implementation of `func_1` does not meet the problem requirements, making the overall program incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
