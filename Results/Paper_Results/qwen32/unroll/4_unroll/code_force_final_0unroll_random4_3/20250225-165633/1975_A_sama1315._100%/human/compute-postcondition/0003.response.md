`idx` is incremented by 1, and `t` is assigned the value of the integer conversion of the string at index `idx` of `data`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50 and each element `a_i` in `a` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from standard input; `idx` is 1; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.**
