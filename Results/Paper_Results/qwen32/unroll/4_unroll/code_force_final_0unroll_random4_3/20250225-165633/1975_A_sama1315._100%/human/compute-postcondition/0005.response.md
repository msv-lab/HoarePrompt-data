The provided Python code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. This action does not affect the values of `a`, `data`, `idx`, or `t`. Therefore, the only change in the state is the introduction of the `results` list, which is now an empty list.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50 and each element `a_i` in `a` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from standard input; `idx` is 2; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list.**
