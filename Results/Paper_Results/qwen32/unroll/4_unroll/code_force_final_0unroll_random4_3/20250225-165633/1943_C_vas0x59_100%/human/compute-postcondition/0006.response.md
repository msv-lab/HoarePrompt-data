Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains the indices of the vertices that are directly connected to the vertex represented by the index of the outer list; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as updated by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to each vertex.**

In this output state, the `d` list has been updated with the shortest distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as determined by the `bfs` function. The `previous` list now contains the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to each vertex. The variables `u2vs` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
