The code snippet provided initializes a new list `path_ba` with the single element `b`. No other variables are modified by this code.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains the indices of the vertices that are directly connected to the vertex represented by the index of the outer list; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as updated by the `bfs` function; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to each vertex; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`.**
