The code snippet `u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]` initializes the `u2vs` variable to be a list of `n` empty lists. Each sublist corresponds to a vertex in the tree and will be used to store the vertices connected to that vertex.

Given the initial state that `u2vs` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers representing the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex, and `n` is the input integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, the code reinitializes `u2vs` to a list of `n` empty lists.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists; `n` is the input integer representing the number of vertices in the tree.**
