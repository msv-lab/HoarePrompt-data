Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains the indices of the vertices that are directly connected to the vertex represented by the index of the outer list. Each connection is bidirectional, meaning if vertex `u` is connected to vertex `v`, then vertex `v` is also connected to vertex `u`.**
