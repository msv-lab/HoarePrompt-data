The code snippet `n = int(input())` takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state mentions that `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in a tree, and `u2vs` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers representing the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex (0-indexed).

Since the code snippet changes the value of `n` to the input value, we need to reflect this in the output state. The value of `u2vs` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers representing the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex (0-indexed); `n` is the input integer representing the number of vertices in the tree.**
