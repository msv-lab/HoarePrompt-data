Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules described. The game described is a variant of the Nim game, and the correct strategy involves the use of the XOR operation on the sizes of the piles, not the sorted unique sizes of the piles.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        xor_sum = 0
        for num in arr:
            xor_sum ^= num
        if xor_sum == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

In this corrected version, we calculate the XOR of all pile sizes. If the XOR sum is zero, Bob wins (as Alice cannot make a move that will change the XOR sum to a non-zero value). Otherwise, Alice wins because she can always make a move that changes the XOR sum to zero, putting Bob in a losing position.
