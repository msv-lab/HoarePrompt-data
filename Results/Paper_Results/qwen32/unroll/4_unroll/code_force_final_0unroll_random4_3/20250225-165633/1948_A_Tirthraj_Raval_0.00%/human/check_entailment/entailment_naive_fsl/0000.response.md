Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly handle all cases for the problem description. Specifically, it incorrectly assumes that the number of special characters `n` must be even to construct a valid string. However, the problem description does not impose this restriction.

For example, consider the test case where `n = 1`. According to the problem statement, it should be possible to construct a string with exactly 1 special character. The program, however, will print "NO" for `n = 1` because it checks if `n % 2 == 1` and returns "NO" in that case.

Here is a counterexample:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  1
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  YES
  ABA
  ```
- Actual Output from the Program:
  ```
  NO
  ```

The program should be able to handle odd values of `n` as well. For instance, a string like "ABA" for `n = 1`, "ABACABA" for `n = 3`, and so on, can be constructed to have exactly `n` special characters.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
