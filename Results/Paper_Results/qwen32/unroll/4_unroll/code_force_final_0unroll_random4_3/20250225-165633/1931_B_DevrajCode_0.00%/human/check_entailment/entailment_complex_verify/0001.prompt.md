You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
a = list(map(int, data[1:]))
print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if total_water % n != 0:
        return 'No'
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'

- Annotated Code: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
a = list(map(int, data[1:]))
print(func_1(n, a))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of the elements in a is divisible by n.
def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if (total_water % n != 0) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of the elements in `a` is divisible by `n`, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, and `total_water % n` is equal to 0
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
        
    #State: container is 0.
    return 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'Yes'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns 'Yes' if it is possible to redistribute the elements of `a` such that each element becomes equal to the average of the list, otherwise it returns 'No'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then interprets the first element as the number of test cases (`t`), and the subsequent elements as the container capacities for each test case.
   - However, there's an issue here: the program assumes that all test cases are provided in a single line, which is not the case as per the problem description. Each test case has multiple lines of input.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program calculates the total amount of water (`total_water`) and checks if it is divisible by `n` (the number of containers).
   - It calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`target = total_water // n`).
   - It then iterates through the containers, keeping a running balance (`container`) of the difference between the current container's water and the target.
   - If at any point the running balance becomes negative, it returns 'No', indicating that it's not possible to equalize the water levels using the allowed operations.
   - If the loop completes without the balance going negative, it returns 'Yes'.

3. **Logic for Correctness:**
   - The core logic of the program is correct: if, while going through the containers, we ever find that we need to take water from a container that doesn't have enough (i.e., the running balance goes negative), then it's impossible to equalize the water levels using the allowed operations (pouring from left to right only).
   - However, the program does not correctly parse the input for multiple test cases, which is a critical issue.

### Conclusion:
The program contains a significant flaw in how it reads and processes multiple test cases. It assumes all input is provided in a single line, which is not correct according to the problem description. Therefore, the program will not work as intended for inputs with multiple test cases.

**Correctness: False**

### Corrected Input Handling Example:
To fix the input handling, we would need to read the input line by line and process each test case separately. Here's a corrected version of the input handling part:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().splitlines()

index = 0
t = int(data[index])
index += 1

results = []

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[index].split()))
    index += 1
    results.append(func_1(n, a))

for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if total_water % n != 0:
        return 'No'
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'
```

This corrected version properly handles multiple test cases and processes each one independently.
