Reasoning:
The program is intended to determine if it is possible to redistribute the water in the containers such that each container has the same amount of water, which is the total amount of water divided by the number of containers (n). The function `func_1` correctly checks this by first ensuring that the total water is divisible by `n` (which is guaranteed by the problem statement, so this check is redundant but does not affect correctness).

The main logic of the function is to simulate the redistribution process by iterating over the containers and keeping track of the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the target amount (which is `total_water // n`). If at any point this cumulative difference becomes negative, it means that more water has been removed than added up to that point, which would imply that it is impossible to redistribute the water as required by the problem constraints (pouring water is only allowed from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index).

However, there is a logical flaw in the provided code. The check `if container < 0` is not sufficient to determine if the redistribution is possible. This check only ensures that we do not end up with a negative amount of water in any container at any point, but it does not guarantee that we can actually redistribute the water to make all containers equal.

The correct approach would be to ensure that the cumulative difference never goes negative, which the current code does, but it also needs to ensure that by the end of the iteration, the cumulative difference is zero (which it implicitly does since the sum of the differences must be zero for the redistribution to be possible).

Given the provided test cases and the logic described, the program seems to pass the provided test cases, but it does not fully cover all edge cases. However, based on the provided states and the given problem constraints, the logic appears to be correct for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
