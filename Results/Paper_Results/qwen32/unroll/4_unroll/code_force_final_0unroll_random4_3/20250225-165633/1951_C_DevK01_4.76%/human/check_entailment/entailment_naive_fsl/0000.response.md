Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase exactly `k` tickets given the constraints. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. **Sorting the Prices**: The program sorts the prices and then tries to purchase tickets based on the sorted prices. However, the optimal strategy is not necessarily to buy tickets on the cheapest days first, especially considering the price increase rule.

2. **Price Increase Rule**: The program does not correctly account for the price increase rule. If you buy `x` tickets on day `i`, the prices for subsequent days increase by `x`. The provided code does not dynamically adjust the prices after each purchase, which is crucial for minimizing the total cost.

3. **Handling the Remaining Tickets**: The program calculates the number of full batches of `m` tickets that can be bought and then handles the remaining tickets separately. This approach does not consider the optimal purchase strategy across multiple days.

### Counterexample:

Let's consider a simple counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2 4
1 3 2 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
10
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Buy 2 tickets on the first day at a cost of `1 * 2 = 2`. Prices become `[3, 4, 6, 6]`.
- Buy 2 tickets on the second day at a cost of `3 * 2 = 6`. Prices become `[4, 6, 8, 8]`.
- Total cost = `2 + 6 = 8`.

However, the provided code will not necessarily follow this optimal strategy and might end up with a higher cost.

### Why the Code Fails:
The code does not dynamically adjust the prices after each purchase and does not consider the optimal purchase strategy. It simply sorts the prices and tries to buy tickets in batches, which does not guarantee the minimum cost.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified and the counterexample provided, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
