You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains three integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9)) representing the number of sale days, the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, and the number of tickets to be bought at the end, respectively. The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        L = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        M = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
        
        m = min(m, k)
        
        M.sort()
        
        q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
        
        N = M[:q]
        
        n = len(N)
        
        if n * m == k:
            cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
        else:
            w = N.pop()
            mu = k - (n - 1) * m
            cost = mu * w
            n = len(N)
            cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu
        
        print(cost)
        
        continue
        
    #State: the sequence of costs printed for each of the t test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `a` representing the number of sale days, the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased each day, the total number of tickets to be bought, and the price per ticket for each day, respectively. The function returns the minimum total cost to buy `k` tickets, considering the constraints on the number of tickets that can be purchased each day.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
