Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` of the same length, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. It then prints two new integers `kq1` and `kq2` for each test case. The digits in `kq1` and `kq2` are determined by comparing the corresponding digits of `x` and `y` and applying specific rules to ensure that `kq1` is always greater than or equal to `kq2`.**
