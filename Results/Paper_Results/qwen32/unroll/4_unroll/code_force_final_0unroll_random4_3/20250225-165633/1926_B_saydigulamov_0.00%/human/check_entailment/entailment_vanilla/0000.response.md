Let's analyze the provided program and compare it against the problem requirements step by step.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Input:**
   - An integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, an integer `n` representing the size of the grid.
   - An `n x n` grid of characters, each either '0' or '1'.
   
2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, print "SQUARE" if the grid contains a square, or "TRIANGLE" if the grid contains a triangle.
   
3. **Shape Definitions:**
   - A **square** is defined as a shape of `k x k` '1's where `k > 1`.
   - A **triangle** is defined as a shape of `k` rows where the `i-th` row has `2*i - 1` '1's, or an upside-down triangle with the same property.

### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n`.
   - It then reads the grid row by row.
   
2. **Processing the Grid:**
   - For each row in the grid that contains at least one '1', it counts the number of '1's and appends this count to the list `k`.
   
3. **Determining the Shape:**
   - The program checks if the first two counts in `k` are equal (`k[0] == k[1]`).
   - If they are equal, it prints the entire list `k`.
   - If they are not equal, the program does nothing, which means it does not print anything for that case.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Output Requirements:**
   - The program does not print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required.
   - Instead, it prints the entire list `k` when `k[0] == k[1]`, which is not the expected output.
   
2. **Logic for Determining Shape:**
   - The program only checks if the first two rows with '1's have the same number of '1's.
   - This is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle.
   - For example, a triangle might have the first two rows with 1 and 3 '1's, respectively, but the program would not handle this correctly.
   
3. **Handling Upside-Down Triangles:**
   - The program does not account for upside-down triangles.
   
4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the shape does not start at the top-left corner of the grid.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle, nor does it produce the correct output format.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
