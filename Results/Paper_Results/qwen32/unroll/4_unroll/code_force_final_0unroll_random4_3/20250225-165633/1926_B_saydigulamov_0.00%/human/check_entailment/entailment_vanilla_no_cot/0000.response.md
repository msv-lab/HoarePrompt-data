Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a triangle or a square. Here are the issues with the code:

1. The program only checks if the number of `1`s in the first two rows are equal, which is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle. For example, a triangle with `k=3` would have `1, 3, 5` ones in its rows, and a square with `k=3` would have `3, 3, 3` ones in its rows. The program does not correctly handle these cases.

2. The program does not account for the structure of the shape. It does not check if the `1`s form a triangle or a square based on their positions.

3. The program prints the list `k` instead of printing "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE".

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to check the following:

- For a square, all rows with `1`s should have the same number of `1`s, and the `1`s should be aligned in the same column positions.
- For a triangle, the number of `1`s in each row should form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2, and the `1`s should be centered in the rows.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for _ in range(a):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Find the rows with 1s
        ones_positions = []
        for row in grid:
            positions = [i for i, x in enumerate(row) if x == '1']
            if positions:
                ones_positions.append(positions)
        
        # Determine if it's a square or a triangle
        if len(ones_positions) > 1:
            first_row = ones_positions[0]
            is_square = all(len(row) == len(first_row) and row == first_row for row in ones_positions)
            is_triangle = all(len(row) == 2 * (i + 1) - 1 and row[0] + row[-1] == 2 * first_row[0] + 2 * i for i, row in enumerate(ones_positions))
            if is_square:
                print("SQUARE")
            elif is_triangle or all(len(row) == 2 * (len(ones_positions) - i) - 1 and row[0] + row[-1] == 2 * first_row[0] + 2 * (len(ones_positions) - i - 1) for i, row in enumerate(ones_positions)):
                print("TRIANGLE")
            else:
                print("UNKNOWN")  # This case should not happen as per the problem statement

func()
```

This corrected version checks the structure of the shape and prints the correct result based on the problem description.
