To determine the output state, we need to carefully analyze the provided loop and understand its behavior given the input constraints. Here's the breakdown of the loop:

1. **Outer Loop (`for i in range(a)`)**: This loop runs `a` times.
2. **Inner Loop (`for _ in range(int(input()))`)**: For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs a number of times specified by the integer input.
3. **Processing Inside Inner Loop**:
   - It reads a string `b` as input.
   - If the string `b` contains the character '1', it counts the number of '1's in `b` and appends this count to the list `k`.
4. **Condition Check**:
   - After the inner loop completes, the code checks if the first and second elements of the list `k` are equal (`k[0] == k[1]`).
   - If the condition is true, it prints the list `k`.

Given the problem constraints, we know:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, but it is not directly used in the loop.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10, and it defines the size of the grid.
- The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that consists of all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.
- `a` is an input integer that determines how many times the outer loop runs.

The key point here is that the output depends on the values provided during the execution of the inner loop, specifically whether the first and second counts of '1's in the strings are equal. Since the problem does not specify the exact input values for the strings, we can only describe the output state in a general form based on the given conditions.

Let's assume the input values for the strings are such that the first and second counts of '1's are equal, which would trigger the print statement. The output state would be the list `k` with the counts of '1's.

For example, if `a = 1` and the input strings for the inner loop are "11" and "11", the output would be `[2, 2]`.

Output State: **the output state you calculate.**

Since the exact input values are not provided, the output state can vary, but if we assume that the condition `k[0] == k[1]` is met, the output state would be a list with two equal counts of '1's from the input strings.

Output State: **[count_of_ones, count_of_ones]** where `count_of_ones` is the number of '1's in the first and second input strings.

For a concrete example, assuming `count_of_ones = 2`:

Output State: **[2, 2]**
