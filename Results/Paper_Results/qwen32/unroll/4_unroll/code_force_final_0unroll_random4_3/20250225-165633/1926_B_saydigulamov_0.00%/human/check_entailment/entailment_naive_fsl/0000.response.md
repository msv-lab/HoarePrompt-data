Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a triangle or a square. The current implementation only checks if the count of '1's in the first two rows with '1's are equal and prints the counts, which is not sufficient to determine the shape.

Here are some issues with the code:
1. The program does not handle all the rows, only the first two rows containing '1's.
2. It does not check the pattern of '1's to determine if they form a triangle or a square.
3. The output is not in the required format ("SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE").

Let's consider a test case to illustrate the problem:

**Test Case:**
```
1
3
001
011
111
```
**Expected Output:**
```
TRIANGLE
```
**Actual Output:**
```
[1, 2]
```

The program incorrectly prints the counts of '1's in the first two rows with '1's instead of determining the shape and printing "TRIANGLE".

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
