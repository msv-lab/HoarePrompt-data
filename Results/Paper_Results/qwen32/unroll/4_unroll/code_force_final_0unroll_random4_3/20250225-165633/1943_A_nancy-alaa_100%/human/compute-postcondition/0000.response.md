To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This indicates that the loop will execute based on the integer value provided by the input.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be initialized or adjusted. The `int(input())` determines how many times the loop will execute.

2. **Input Requirement**: For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be a positive integer. Given that `t` is the number of test cases and `1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4`, we can infer that the input should be `t` to ensure the loop runs `t` times.

3. **State Adjustment**: The state before the loop should ensure that `t` is correctly set as the input. The variables `n` and `a` are mentioned in the problem statement but are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted in the state before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state before the loop should ensure that the input is `t`, which is the number of test cases.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4**
