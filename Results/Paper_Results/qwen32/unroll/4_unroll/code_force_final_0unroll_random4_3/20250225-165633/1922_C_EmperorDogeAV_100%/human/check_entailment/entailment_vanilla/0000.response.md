Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding
The task is to determine the minimum number of coins required to travel from one city to another in a series of queries. The cities are located on a number line, and you can either move to the closest city for 1 coin or to any other city for the distance cost.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities (`n`), the positions of the cities, the number of queries (`m`), and the queries themselves.

2. **Closest City Calculation:**
   - The program uses the `func_1` function to determine the closest city for each city. 
   - `func_1` computes the cost to move to the closest city for each city in the forward direction.
   - It then reverses the list of cities and computes the cost to move to the closest city for each city in the backward direction.
   - The costs are stored in `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix sums for the costs stored in `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`.
   - `pref_sum_f` contains the prefix sums for the forward direction.
   - `pref_sum_b` contains the prefix sums for the backward direction.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program determines the minimum number of coins required to travel from city `a` to city `b`.
   - If `a < b`, it uses the prefix sums from `pref_sum_f` to calculate the cost.
   - If `a > b`, it uses the prefix sums from `pref_sum_b` to calculate the cost.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest City Costs:**
   - The `func_1` function does not correctly calculate the cost to move to the closest city.
   - The function is supposed to return the cost to move to the closest city, but it only checks the next city (`forward`) and the previous city (`back`) and incorrectly assigns `1` if the next city is closer, otherwise, it assigns the distance to the next city.
   - The problem requires moving to the closest city using 1 coin, not the distance to the closest city.

2. **Prefix Sum Usage:**
   - The prefix sums are calculated based on the incorrect closest city costs, which leads to incorrect results for the queries.

### Correctness
Given the issues in the calculation of the closest city costs and the incorrect usage of prefix sums, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
