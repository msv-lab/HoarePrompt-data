### Reasoning:

The provided code is supposed to solve the problem by determining the minimum number of coins required to travel between two cities based on the given rules. Let's analyze the code and its logic step-by-step.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, their coordinates, the number of queries `m`, and the queries themselves.

2. **Determining Closest Cities:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the closest city for each city (except the last one) by comparing the distances to the previous and next cities.
   - It assigns `1` to `prog_cities[i]` if the next city is closer; otherwise, it assigns the distance to the previous city.
   - This part of the code seems to be working correctly based on the problem statement.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are prefix sums of the `prog_cities` list for forward and backward directions, respectively.
   - `pref_sum_f` accumulates the cost of traveling from the first city to each subsequent city using the closest city rule.
   - `pref_sum_b` does the same but in the reverse direction.
   - These prefix sums are used to quickly calculate the cost of traveling between any two cities.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the code calculates the cost of traveling from city `a` to city `b` using the prefix sums.
   - If `a < b`, it uses `pref_sum_f` to find the cost.
   - If `a > b`, it uses `pref_sum_b` to find the cost.
   - This logic seems correct as it leverages the precomputed prefix sums to efficiently answer each query.

### Issues and Corrections:

- **Initialization of `prog_cities`:** The function `func_1` initializes `prog_cities` with `n-1` elements, which is correct. However, it should handle the edge cases properly, especially for the first and last cities.
- **Handling of Closest Cities:** The logic in `func_1` assumes that for each city, there is a uniquely closest city. This is consistent with the problem statement.
- **Prefix Sum Calculation:** The prefix sums are calculated correctly, but the last element of `backward_cities` is not used, which seems fine since we reverse the list before using it.

### Conclusion:

The code appears to be correctly implementing the logic to solve the problem. It reads the input, determines the closest cities, calculates the prefix sums, and efficiently answers each query using these precomputed values.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
