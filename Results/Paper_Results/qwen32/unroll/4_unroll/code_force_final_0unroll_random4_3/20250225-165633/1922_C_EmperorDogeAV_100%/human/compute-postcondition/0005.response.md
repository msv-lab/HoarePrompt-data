Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `cities` representing the coordinates of cities in ascending order and an integer `n` which is the number of test cases. It calculates, for each city (except the last one), whether the next city is closer or the previous city is closer, and returns a list `prog_cities` of `n-1` elements. Each element in `prog_cities` is either `1` if the next city is closer or the distance to the previous city if the previous city is closer.**
