The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. For each test case, it determines whether it's possible to repaint up to `k` parts of a ribbon divided into `n` parts using `m` colors, under the condition that not all parts are repainted and the remaining unpainted parts are not all of the same color. It outputs 'YES' if the condition is met and 'NO' otherwise.
