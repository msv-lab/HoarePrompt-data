Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix based on the allowed operations. The program calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix using the formula \( n \times (n + 1) \times (4 \times n - 1) // 6 \), which is correct for the maximum sum achievable. However, the operations it performs to achieve this sum are incorrect.

The program performs Type 1 and Type 2 operations with a descending permutation for each row and column, but this does not necessarily lead to the maximum sum. The operations should be designed to place the highest possible numbers in the matrix while adhering to the constraints of the problem.

Let's consider a simple counterexample:

For \( n = 2 \):

- The maximum sum is \( 7 \), which can be achieved by setting the matrix as:
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  3 & 2 \\
  2 & 1
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]

- The program's operations would be:
  - Type 1 operation on row 1 with permutation [2, 1]
  - Type 1 operation on row 2 with permutation [2, 1]
  - Type 2 operation on column 1 with permutation [2, 1]
  - Type 2 operation on column 2 with permutation [2, 1]

  This results in the matrix:
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  2 & 1 \\
  2 & 1
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
  which has a sum of \( 6 \), not \( 7 \).

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the operations to achieve the maximum sum for all cases, making it incorrect.
