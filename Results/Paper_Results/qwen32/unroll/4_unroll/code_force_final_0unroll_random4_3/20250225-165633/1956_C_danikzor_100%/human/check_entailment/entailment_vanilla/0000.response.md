Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \(n \times n\) matrix using up to \(2n\) operations. The operations involve setting a row or a column to a permutation of the numbers from 1 to \(n\).

### Optimal Strategy

To maximize the sum, we should ideally place the largest possible numbers in the matrix. The largest numbers are \(n, n-1, \ldots, 1\). The optimal strategy would be to fill each row and each column with these numbers in descending order. This ensures that the sum of the matrix is maximized.

### Calculation of Maximum Sum

The maximum sum of the matrix can be calculated as the sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers, repeated \(n\) times. The sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers is given by the formula \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\). Since each number from 1 to \(n\) appears exactly \(n\) times in the matrix, the total sum is:

\[
\text{Sum} = n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2}
\]

### Correctness of the Program

Let's examine the provided program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \(n\).

2. **Calculating the Maximum Sum:**
   - The program calculates the maximum sum using the formula \(\frac{n^2(n+1)}{2}\).

3. **Generating Operations:**
   - The program outputs \(2n\) operations, where each row and each column is set to the permutation \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\).

### Verification of Operations

- **Row Operations:**
  - The first \(n\) operations set each row to \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\).
- **Column Operations:**
  - The next \(n\) operations set each column to \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\).

However, note that performing both row and column operations with the same permutation will not maximize the sum as intended. The operations should be designed to ensure that the matrix is filled with the largest possible numbers in a way that maximizes the overall sum. The provided program's operations do not guarantee the optimal arrangement of numbers.

### Conclusion

The program calculates the correct maximum sum but does not correctly generate the operations to achieve this sum. The operations provided do not guarantee that the matrix is filled with the largest possible numbers in an optimal way.

**Correctness: False**

The program does not correctly generate the operations to maximize the sum of the matrix as intended by the problem statement.
