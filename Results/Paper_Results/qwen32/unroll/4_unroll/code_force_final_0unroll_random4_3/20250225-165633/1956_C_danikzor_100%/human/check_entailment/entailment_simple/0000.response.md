### Reasoning:

The given program seems to address the problem by calculating the maximum possible sum of the matrix and providing a sequence of operations to achieve this sum. Let's break down the approach:

1. **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum sum is `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`. This formula is derived from the sum of the first `n` natural numbers and their permutations, which is the optimal sum achievable with the given operations.

2. **Operations to Achieve the Maximum Sum:**
   - The program outputs `2 * n` operations, which is within the allowed limit of `2 * n` operations.
   - For each row `i` from `1` to `n`, the program performs two operations:
     - A Type 1 operation to assign the values from `n` to `1` to the `i`-th row.
     - A Type 2 operation to assign the values from `n` to `1` to the `i`-th column.
   - The values assigned are permutations of the numbers from `1` to `n` in descending order.

3. **Verification of Operations:**
   - The operations described ensure that each row and each column ends up with the numbers `n` to `1` in descending order. This arrangement maximizes the sum because the highest numbers are placed in every possible position in the matrix.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and provides a valid sequence of operations to achieve this sum. The operations are within the allowed limit, and the sum is computed using a formula that matches the problem's requirements.
