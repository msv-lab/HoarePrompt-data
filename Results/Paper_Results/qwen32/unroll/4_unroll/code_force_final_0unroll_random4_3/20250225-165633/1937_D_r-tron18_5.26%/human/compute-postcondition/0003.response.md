Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n` equals the length of `s1`, `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where the character '>' appears in `s1`, `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0.**

In natural language: The output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `suffZero` which is a list containing a single element 0. All other variables retain their original values and meanings.
