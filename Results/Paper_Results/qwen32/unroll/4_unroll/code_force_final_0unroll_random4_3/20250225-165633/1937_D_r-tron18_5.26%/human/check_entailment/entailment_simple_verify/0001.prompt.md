You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given Python program correctly solves the problem, we need to analyze the logic and steps involved in the code. Let's break down the program step by step:

### Function 1: `func_1(arr, times)`
- This function calculates the difference between the last element of the array `arr` and the element at the position `max(-n, -1 - times)`.
- It seems to be used for computing differences in accumulated sums, which is useful for determining how many times certain conditions have been met.

### Function 2: `func_2(s1, n)`
- `s1` is the string of '<' and '>' characters representing the grid.
- `n` is the length of the grid.
- `pre` is a list of indices where the character is '>'. This helps in tracking positions of '>' characters.
- `totalOne` keeps track of the number of '>' characters.
- `preOne` is an accumulated sum of indices of '>' characters.
- `suffZero` is a list that accumulates indices of '<' characters, starting from the end of the string.
- `ans` is the list that will store the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

### Main Logic:
- The code iterates over the string `s1` from right to left.
- For each character, it checks if it is '>' or '<'.
- If it is '>', it calculates the number of seconds based on the accumulated sums of '>' and '<' characters.
- If it is '<', it updates the accumulated sum of '<' characters and then calculates the number of seconds based on the accumulated sums.
- The calculations involve complex manipulations of the accumulated sums to determine the exact number of moves required for the pinball to exit the grid.

### Verification:
- The program uses accumulated sums to efficiently calculate the number of moves. This is crucial given the constraints (up to 500,000 characters in the grid).
- The logic for handling '<' and '>' characters and updating the accumulated sums seems consistent with the problem requirements.
- The output format matches the problem description, where the number of seconds for each starting position is printed.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It efficiently handles the large input sizes and constraints using accumulated sums and careful index manipulations.
