Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the described pinball movement and inversion rules for every potential case. There are several issues and edge cases that the code does not handle correctly.

1. **Inversion of Characters**: The code does not actually invert the characters in the grid after each move of the pinball. The problem description specifies that the character should be inverted after the pinball moves, but the code does not perform this inversion.

2. **Movement Logic**: The code uses a complex approach with prefix and suffix sums to calculate the number of moves, which is not straightforward and might not correctly simulate the described movement rules for all cases. The movement logic is not directly implemented but rather inferred from the sums, which might lead to incorrect results for certain grid configurations.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases such as grids with only '<' or only '>' characters, or grids where the pinball might bounce back and forth between two cells indefinitely if the inversion rules were applied correctly.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple test case:

**Input:**
```
1
3
><<
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2 4 3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- For the first cell (index 0), the pinball moves right to the second cell (index 1), inverts the character to '<', then moves left to the first cell (index 0), inverts the character to '>', and finally moves right out of the grid in 2 seconds.
- For the second cell (index 1), the pinball moves left to the first cell (index 0), inverts the character to '>', then moves right to the second cell (index 1), inverts the character to '>', moves right to the third cell (index 2), inverts the character to '<', and finally moves left to the second cell (index 1), inverts the character to '>', and finally moves right out of the grid in 4 seconds.
- For the third cell (index 2), the pinball moves left to the second cell (index 1), inverts the character to '>', then moves right to the third cell (index 2), inverts the character to '<', and finally moves left out of the grid in 3 seconds.

However, the provided code does not correctly simulate this process and will likely produce incorrect results for this and other similar cases.

Therefore, the code is not correct for all potential cases and should be considered incorrect.
