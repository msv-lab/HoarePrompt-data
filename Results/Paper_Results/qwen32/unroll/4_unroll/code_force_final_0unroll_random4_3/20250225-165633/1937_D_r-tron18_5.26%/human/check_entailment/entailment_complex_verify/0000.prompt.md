You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

    1 4 7 10 8 1 
    
Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the described pinball movement and inversion rules for every potential case. There are several issues and edge cases that the code does not handle correctly.

1. **Inversion of Characters**: The code does not actually invert the characters in the grid after each move of the pinball. The problem description specifies that the character should be inverted after the pinball moves, but the code does not perform this inversion.

2. **Movement Logic**: The code uses a complex approach with prefix and suffix sums to calculate the number of moves, which is not straightforward and might not correctly simulate the described movement rules for all cases. The movement logic is not directly implemented but rather inferred from the sums, which might lead to incorrect results for certain grid configurations.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases such as grids with only '<' or only '>' characters, or grids where the pinball might bounce back and forth between two cells indefinitely if the inversion rules were applied correctly.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple test case:

**Input:**
```
1
3
><<
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2 4 3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- For the first cell (index 0), the pinball moves right to the second cell (index 1), inverts the character to '<', then moves left to the first cell (index 0), inverts the character to '>', and finally moves right out of the grid in 2 seconds.
- For the second cell (index 1), the pinball moves left to the first cell (index 0), inverts the character to '>', then moves right to the second cell (index 1), inverts the character to '>', moves right to the third cell (index 2), inverts the character to '<', and finally moves left to the second cell (index 1), inverts the character to '>', and finally moves right out of the grid in 4 seconds.
- For the third cell (index 2), the pinball moves left to the second cell (index 1), inverts the character to '>', then moves right to the third cell (index 2), inverts the character to '<', and finally moves left out of the grid in 3 seconds.

However, the provided code does not correctly simulate this process and will likely produce incorrect results for this and other similar cases.

Therefore, the code is not correct for all potential cases and should be considered incorrect.
