### Reasoning:
The program is designed to determine whether a given subarray of an array is "interesting" based on the XOR property. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of its logic and correctness:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through each test case, extracting the number of elements `n`, the number of queries `q`, the array `a`, and the queries themselves.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR array `pf` where `pf[i]` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to the `i-th` element.
   - It also maintains a dictionary `mp` where keys are the values of the prefix XOR and the values are lists of indices where these prefix XOR values occur.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query defined by `l` and `r`, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l-1]` to `a[r-1]` using the prefix XOR array.
   - If the XOR of the subarray is `0`, it means the subarray can trivially be split into any number of parts with equal XOR (since XOR of any number of zeros is zero), and the program appends 'YES' to the results.
   - If the XOR is not `0`, the program checks if there are indices in the prefix XOR array that can be used to split the subarray into parts with equal XOR:
     - It looks for indices in `mp[pf[r]]` that are greater than or equal to `l`.
     - It looks for indices in `mp[pf[l-1]]` that are less than or equal to `r`.
     - If there exists an index in `mp[pf[r]]` that is less than an index in `mp[pf[l-1]]`, it means the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR, and the program appends 'YES' to the results. Otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for all queries in the required format.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the XOR property. The use of prefix XOR and binary search (`bisect_left`) ensures that the solution is efficient and can handle the input constraints.
- The prefix XOR calculation ensures that we can quickly compute the XOR of any subarray.
- The use of the dictionary `mp` and binary search helps in efficiently finding potential split points in the subarray.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
