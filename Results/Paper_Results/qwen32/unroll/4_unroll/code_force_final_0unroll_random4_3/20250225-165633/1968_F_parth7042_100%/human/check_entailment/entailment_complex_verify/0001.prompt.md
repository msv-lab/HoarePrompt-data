You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines if there exists a subarray within the specified range that has a bitwise XOR of zero. The function outputs 'YES' if such a subarray exists and 'NO' otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:
The program aims to determine whether a subarray of a given array is "interesting" based on the criteria provided. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads input data from standard input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases (`t`), the number of elements in the array (`n`), the number of queries (`q`), the array elements (`a`), and the query ranges (`l` and `r`).

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - For each test case, it calculates the prefix XOR array (`pf`) where `pf[i]` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to the `i-th` element.
   - It also maintains a dictionary (`mp`) that maps each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where this XOR value occurs.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `r` using the prefix XOR array: `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
   - If `x` is `0`, it means the entire subarray can be split into any number of segments with the same XOR value (since the XOR of the entire subarray is `0`), so the subarray is "interesting".
   - If `x` is not `0`, the program checks if there are indices in the prefix XOR array where the prefix XOR value is the same at the start and end of the subarray, but not at the boundaries. This is done using binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate indices in the list of occurrences of the prefix XOR values.
   - If such indices exist and are valid (i.e., the subarray can be split into two or more segments with the same XOR value), the subarray is "interesting".

4. **Output:**
   - The program collects the results for all queries and prints them in the required format.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "interesting" based on the criteria provided. It efficiently uses prefix XOR and binary search to handle the large input sizes within the constraints. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
