You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the printed value of `ans` for each test case. The state of variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remains unchanged outside the loop, as they are only used for input and do not affect the state after the loop ends.
    #
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and lists `a` and `b`. For each test case, it determines how many contiguous subarrays of length `m` in list `a` contain at least `k` elements that are also in list `b`. The function outputs the count of such subarrays for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the provided Python program is correct, we need to analyze its logic and ensure that it correctly counts the number of good subsegments of array `a` for each test case.

Here's a step-by-step reasoning of the program:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, which represent the length of array `a`, the length of array `b`, and the required number of matching elements, respectively.
   - It then reads the elements of array `a` and array `b`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `todo` is initialized as a set containing all elements of array `b`.
   - `done` and `extra` are initialized as empty sets. `done` will store elements from the current subsegment of `a` that are also in `b`, and `extra` will store elements from the current subsegment of `a` that are not in `b`.

3. **First Subsegment Processing**:
   - For the first subsegment of length `m` in `a`, it iterates through the elements.
   - If an element is in `todo`, it is moved from `todo` to `done`.
   - If an element is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`.
   - It checks if the number of elements in `done` is at least `k` and sets `ans` to 1 if true, otherwise 0.

4. **Sliding Window**:
   - For each subsequent subsegment, it slides the window one element to the right.
   - It removes the element that is no longer in the window (`old`).
     - If `old` is in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`.
     - If `old` is in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added back to `todo`.
   - It adds the new element that enters the window (`a[r]`).
     - If `a[r]` is in `todo`, it is moved from `todo` to `done`.
     - If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`.
   - It checks if the number of elements in `done` is at least `k` and increments `ans` if true.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all subsegments for a test case, it prints the value of `ans`.

### Analysis:

- The program uses a sliding window approach to efficiently count the number of good subsegments.
- It maintains the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` to keep track of elements in the current window.
- The logic for moving elements between `todo`, `done`, and `extra` as the window slides is correct.
- The condition to check if a subsegment is good (i.e., if the number of elements in `done` is at least `k`) is correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of good subsegments of array `a` for each test case as per the problem statement.
