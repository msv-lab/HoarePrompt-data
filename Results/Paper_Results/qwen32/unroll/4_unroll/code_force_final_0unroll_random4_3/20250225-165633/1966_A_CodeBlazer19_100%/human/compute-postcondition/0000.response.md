The code provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. Since the code only reads the value of `t` and does not affect any other variables, the other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 100, followed by a list of `n` integers `c_1, c_2, ..., c_n` where 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 100.**
