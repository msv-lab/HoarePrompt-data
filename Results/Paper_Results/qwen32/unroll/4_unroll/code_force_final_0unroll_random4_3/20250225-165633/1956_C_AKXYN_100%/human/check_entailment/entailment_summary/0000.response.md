### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify whether it correctly calculates the maximum sum of the matrix and performs the operations as described.

1. **Matrix Initialization and Sum Calculation**:
   - The program initializes an `n x n` matrix with each row being a permutation from `1` to `n`.
   - It then calculates the sum `res` using the formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for each row index `i` from `0` to `n-1`. This formula seems to be derived from the sum of the first `n` triangular numbers, which is a way to maximize the sum of the matrix.

2. **Operations**:
   - For each test case, the program prints `2 * n` operations. The operations are of two types:
     - Type 1: Assigning a permutation to a row.
     - Type 2: Assigning a permutation to a column.
   - The program prints these operations in reverse order of `i` from `n` to `1`. Specifically, for each `i`, it prints:
     - `1 i 1 2 3 ... n` (assigning the permutation `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` to row `i`)
     - `2 i 1 2 3 ... n` (assigning the permutation `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` to column `i`)

### Verification:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum `res` calculated by the program is indeed the maximum possible sum for the matrix. The formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` is derived from the sum of the first `n` triangular numbers, which is a known way to maximize the sum of the matrix when using permutations.

2. **Operations**:
   - The operations described in the program are valid. Assigning the permutation `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` to each row and column ensures that each element in the matrix gets the highest possible value (which is `n` for the last row and column, and so on).

3. **Number of Operations**:
   - The program performs exactly `2 * n` operations, which is within the allowed limit.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum sum of the matrix and performs the operations as specified. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
