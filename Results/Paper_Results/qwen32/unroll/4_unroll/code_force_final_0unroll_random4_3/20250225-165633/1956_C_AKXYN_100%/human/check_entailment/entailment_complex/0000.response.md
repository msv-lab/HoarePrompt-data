### Reasoning:
The given program aims to solve the problem by maximizing the sum of all the numbers in an `n x n` matrix using a limited number of operations. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and whether it meets the problem requirements:

1. **Matrix Initialization and Result Calculation:**
   - The matrix is initialized with the first `n` natural numbers in each row.
   - The result `res` is calculated using the formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for each row `i`. This formula suggests that the program is trying to calculate the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, each multiplied by a weight that increases with the row index. However, this formula does not directly yield the maximum sum of the matrix.

2. **Operation Output:**
   - The program outputs `2 * n` operations, each of which is a Type 1 or Type 2 operation.
   - For each row `i` from `n` to `1`, it performs a Type 1 operation to set the `i`-th row to the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`, and a Type 2 operation to set the `i`-th column to the same permutation.

### Analysis:
- **Maximizing the Sum:**
  - The goal is to maximize the sum of the matrix. The optimal way to do this is to place the largest possible numbers in the matrix. The program initializes the matrix with the first `n` natural numbers in each row, but it does not ensure that the maximum possible sum is achieved.
  - The operations performed by the program do not guarantee that the matrix will be filled with the highest possible values to maximize the sum.

- **Number of Operations:**
  - The program outputs `2 * n` operations, which is within the allowed limit of `2n` operations per test case.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix. The formula used to calculate `res` and the operations performed do not ensure that the matrix is filled with the highest possible values to achieve the maximum sum. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
