### Reasoning:

The given program aims to maximize the sum of all the numbers in an \( n \times n \) matrix \( a \) by performing a series of operations. The operations involve filling rows and columns with permutations of the numbers from 1 to \( n \).

#### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Matrix Initialization:**
   - The matrix is initialized with rows filled with permutations from 1 to \( n \).
   - Specifically, each row is filled with the permutation \([1, 2, 3, \ldots, n]\).

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum of the matrix is calculated using the formula \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1)\).
   - This formula is derived from the fact that each row and column will be filled with a permutation, and the maximum sum can be achieved by strategically placing the numbers.

3. **Operations Output:**
   - The program outputs \( 2n \) operations: \( n \) operations to fill the rows and \( n \) operations to fill the columns.
   - Each operation is a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

#### Verification:
- The program correctly calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix.
- The operations are correctly specified and ensure that each row and column is filled with a permutation.
- The number of operations is \( 2n \), which satisfies the constraint of using no more than \( 2n \) operations.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix while adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem.
