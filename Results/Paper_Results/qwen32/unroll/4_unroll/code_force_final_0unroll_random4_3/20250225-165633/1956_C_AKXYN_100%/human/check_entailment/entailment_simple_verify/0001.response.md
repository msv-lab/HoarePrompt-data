Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if the program is indeed correct.

### Problem Recap:
- We have an `n x n` matrix initially filled with zeroes.
- We can perform two types of operations:
  - Type 1: Set a row to a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.
  - Type 2: Set a column to a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.
- Objective: Maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix using no more than `2n` operations.
- Output requirements: For each test case, output the maximum sum and the number of operations used, followed by the operations themselves.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Matrix Initialization**:
   - The program initializes the matrix `mat` with the identity permutation (i.e., `mat[i][j] = j` for all `i` and `j`).
   - This is not actually used in the output, as the program directly calculates the sum and the operations without modifying the matrix.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum of all elements in the matrix using the formula `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`.
   - Let's verify if this formula is correct. The formula calculates the sum of the series:
     \[
     \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \cdot (2i + 1)
     \]
   - Expanding the series:
     \[
     \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (2i^2 + 3i + 1) = 2\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} i^2 + 3\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} i + \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 1
     \]
   - Using the known formulas:
     \[
     \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} i^2 = \frac{(n-1)n(2n-1)}{6}
     \]
     \[
     \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} i = \frac{(n-1)n}{2}
     \]
     \[
     \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 1 = n
     \]
   - Substituting these:
     \[
     2 \cdot \frac{(n-1)n(2n-1)}{6} + 3 \cdot \frac{(n-1)n}{2} + n = \frac{(n-1)n(2n-1)}{3} + \frac{3(n-1)n}{2} + n
     \]
   - Simplifying further, we see that the formula does not directly match the expected sum of the matrix when filled with the maximum possible values.

3. **Operations**:
   - The program outputs `2n` operations, alternating between Type 1 and Type 2 operations.
   - Each operation is a permutation of `1` to `n` applied to a specific row or column.
   - The operations are valid in terms of the problem constraints.

### Verification with Example:
- For `n = 1`, the sum should be `1` (since the matrix is `[[1]]`).
- For `n = 2`, the sum should be `7` (since the matrix can be `[[1, 2], [2, 1]]` or similar permutations).

The formula `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` does not correctly calculate the sum of the matrix when filled with the maximum possible values. The correct sum for an `n x n` matrix filled with the numbers from 1 to n in a way that maximizes the sum is actually the sum of the first `n^2` natural numbers, which is:
\[
\frac{n^2(n^2 + 1)}{2}
\]

### Conclusion:
The program's sum calculation is incorrect. The operations themselves are valid, but the sum calculation does not reflect the correct maximum sum for the matrix.

**Final: False**
