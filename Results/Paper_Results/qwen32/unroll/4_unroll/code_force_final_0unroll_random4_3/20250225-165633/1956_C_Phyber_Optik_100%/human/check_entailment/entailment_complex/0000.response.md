### Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem by maximizing the sum of all the numbers in an n Ã— n matrix using no more than 2n operations. The provided solution calculates the maximum possible sum and outputs the operations needed to achieve this sum.

#### Calculating the Maximum Sum:
The sum of all elements in the matrix is calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i \]

Breaking it down:
- For \( i = 1 \), the sum is 1.
- For \( i \geq 2 \), the term \( (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i \) simplifies to \( (2i - 1) \cdot i \).
- This formula calculates the sum of the series where each element in the i-th row (or column) is filled with the number i, repeated i times.

#### Operations to Achieve Maximum Sum:
The operations are designed to fill the matrix such that:
- The n-th row is filled with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n].
- The (n-1)-th row is filled with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n].
- This pattern continues until the first row.

This is achieved with the following operations:
- For each row from n down to 1, perform a Type 1 operation (fill the row with [1, 2, ..., n]).
- Then, for each column from n down to 1, perform a Type 2 operation (fill the column with [1, 2, ..., n]).

This ensures that each row and column is filled with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n], resulting in the maximum possible sum.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and provides the necessary operations to achieve this sum within the allowed number of operations (2n). The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem description and the provided example.
