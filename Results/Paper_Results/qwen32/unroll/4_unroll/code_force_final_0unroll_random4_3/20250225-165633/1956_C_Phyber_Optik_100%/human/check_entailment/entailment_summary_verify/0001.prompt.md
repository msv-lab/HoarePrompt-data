You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        sum = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
        print(sum, n + n)
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
            print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` representing the size of an `n × n` matrix. For each test case, it calculates a specific `sum` based on the formula provided and prints this `sum` along with `2 * n`. It then prints `n` pairs of lines, each pair consisting of two lines that describe specific patterns involving the matrix's dimensions and indices.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix using no more than 2n operations. We can perform two types of operations:
1. Assign a row with a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.
2. Assign a column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.

The optimal strategy to maximize the sum of the matrix involves filling the matrix with the highest possible values. The highest sum can be achieved by filling the matrix with numbers from 1 to n in the most efficient way.

#### Theoretical Maximum Sum:
For an n x n matrix, the maximum sum is achieved by filling the matrix with the numbers from 1 to n in a way that maximizes the sum of all elements. The sum of the first n natural numbers is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Sum of first n natural numbers} = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \]

Since each row and column can be filled with a permutation of these numbers, the maximum sum of the matrix is:
\[ \text{Maximum sum} = n \times \left(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\right) = \frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2} \]

However, the provided program calculates the sum differently:
\[ \text{Sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \times i \]

Let's simplify this expression:
\[ \text{Sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1)) \times i \]
\[ \text{Sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \times i \]
\[ \text{Sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i) \]
\[ \text{Sum} = 1 + 2\sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 - \sum_{i=2}^{n} i \]

Using the formulas for the sum of squares and the sum of the first n natural numbers:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6} \]
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \]

We can rewrite the sums starting from i=2:
\[ \sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 - 1 = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6} - 1 \]
\[ \sum_{i=2}^{n} i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} i - 1 = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} - 1 \]

Substituting these into the expression for the sum:
\[ \text{Sum} = 1 + 2\left(\frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6} - 1\right) - \left(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} - 1\right) \]
\[ \text{Sum} = 1 + \frac{2n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6} - 2 - \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} + 1 \]
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{2n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6} - \frac{3n(n + 1)}{6} \]
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{2n(n + 1)(2n + 1) - 3n(n + 1)}{6} \]
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)(4n + 2 - 3)}{6} \]
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6} \]

This expression does not match the theoretical maximum sum of \(\frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2}\).

#### Operations:
The provided program performs 2n operations, which is within the allowed limit. Each operation fills a row and a column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. However, the way the operations are performed does not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum of the matrix. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
