Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly generate the operations to maximize the sum of the matrix. The program calculates the sum correctly, but the operations it outputs do not achieve the maximum sum.

The problem requires us to fill the matrix in such a way that the sum is maximized using no more than 2n operations. The operations involve filling rows or columns with permutations of numbers from 1 to n. The program correctly calculates the maximum possible sum, which is the sum of the first n squares, but the operations it generates do not achieve this sum.

For example, consider the case where n = 2. The maximum sum is 1^2 + 2^2 + 2 = 7. To achieve this, we need to fill the matrix as follows:
```
1 2
2 1
```
This can be achieved with the following operations:
```
1 1 1 2
1 2 2 1
```
However, the program outputs:
```
1 2 1 2
1 2 1 2
2 2 1 2
2 1 2 1
```
This does not fill the matrix correctly and does not achieve the maximum sum of 7. Instead, it fills the matrix as:
```
1 2
1 2
```
which results in a sum of 6.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not generate the correct operations to achieve the maximum sum for every potential case.
