Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` representing the size of an `n Ã— n` matrix. For each test case, it calculates a specific `sum` based on the formula provided and prints this `sum` along with `2 * n`. It then prints `n` pairs of lines, each pair consisting of two lines that describe specific patterns involving the matrix's dimensions and indices.**
