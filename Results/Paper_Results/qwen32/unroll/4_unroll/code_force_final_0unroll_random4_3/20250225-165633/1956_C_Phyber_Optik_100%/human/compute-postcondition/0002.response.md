To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all iterations, we need to analyze the provided code and the transformations it performs on the variables.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - `n` is read as the size of the n Ã— n matrix.
   - A variable `sum` is initialized to 1.
   - An inner loop runs from 2 to `n` (inclusive). In each iteration, `sum` is updated using the formula: `sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`, which simplifies to `sum += i * i`.
   - After the inner loop, the program prints `sum` and `n + n` (which is `2 * n`).
   - Another loop runs from 1 to `n` (inclusive). For each iteration, it prints two lines:
     - The first line: `1`, `n - j + 1`, followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`.
     - The second line: `2`, `n - j + 1`, followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Let's understand the final state of the variables after all iterations:

- `t` remains unchanged as it is the number of test cases.
- `n` changes with each iteration of the outer loop but does not retain its value after the loop as it is re-read for each test case.
- `sum` is recalculated for each test case and is not retained after the loop for the same reason as `n`.

The output of the program for each test case consists of:
1. A single line with the calculated `sum` and `2 * n`.
2. `n` pairs of lines, each pair consisting of two lines as described above.

Given these points, the output state after all iterations of the loop is best described as a sequence of outputs for each test case, where each output includes the calculated `sum` and `2 * n`, followed by `n` pairs of lines.

Since we are asked to describe the output state in a similar format as the initial execution state and strictly using the format provided, we can state:

Output State: **a sequence of outputs for each test case, where each output includes the calculated `sum` and `2 * n`, followed by `n` pairs of lines as described in the code.**
