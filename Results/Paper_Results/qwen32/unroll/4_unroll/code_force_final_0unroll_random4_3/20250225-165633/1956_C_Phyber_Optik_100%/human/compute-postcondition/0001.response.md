The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1 because the loop iterates `t` times. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts. The state of `t` is the only one that needs to be ensured for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
