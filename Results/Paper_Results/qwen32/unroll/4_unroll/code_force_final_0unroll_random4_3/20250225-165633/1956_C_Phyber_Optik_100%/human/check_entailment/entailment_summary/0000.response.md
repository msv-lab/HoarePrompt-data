### Reasoning:
The provided program calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix by performing a series of operations that fill the matrix with distinct integers from 1 to n in a way that maximizes the sum. The program then outputs the maximum sum and a sequence of operations that achieve this sum.

Here's a breakdown of the program's approach:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum is calculated using the formula provided in the code. The formula is designed to sum the values in such a way that each number from 1 to n appears in the matrix in a way that maximizes the overall sum.
   - The formula `sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` is equivalent to `sum += i^3`, which is the sum of cubes of numbers from 1 to n. This is indeed the maximum possible sum for the matrix, as each cell will be filled with a unique number from 1 to n, and the sum of the first n natural numbers cubed is the maximum sum achievable.

2. **Operations**:
   - The program outputs `2 * n` operations, with each pair of operations consisting of a Type 1 and a Type 2 operation.
   - The Type 1 operation fills a row with a permutation, and the Type 2 operation fills a column with the same permutation. The permutations used are simple increasing sequences from 1 to n.
   - By performing these operations, the program ensures that each number from 1 to n appears exactly once in each row and each column, which is a valid permutation of the matrix.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly calculates the maximum sum based on the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers.
   - The operations described ensure that the matrix is filled in a way that maximizes the sum and uses no more than `2 * n` operations, as required.
   - The output format matches the problem's requirements, and the operations described are valid according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it calculates the maximum possible sum and provides a valid sequence of operations to achieve this sum within the allowed limit of `2 * n` operations.

**Correctness: True**
