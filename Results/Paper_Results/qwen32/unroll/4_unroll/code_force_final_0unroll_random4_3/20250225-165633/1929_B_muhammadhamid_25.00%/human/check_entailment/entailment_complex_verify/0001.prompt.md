You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8, 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2) — the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        
    #State: The output state consists of t lines, each containing the minimum number of rows that need to be colored to ensure that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell in an n x n grid. For each test case, if k is 1, the output is 1. If k is less than or equal to 2 * n, the output is the ceiling of k divided by 2. Otherwise, the output is k divided by 2 plus one.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the size of a square grid `n` and a minimum number of diagonals `k` that should contain at least one colored cell. For each test case, it calculates and outputs the minimum number of rows that need to be colored to meet the requirement on diagonals.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the logic of the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
We need to color the minimum number of cells in an n x n grid to ensure that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell. The grid has 4n - 2 diagonals in total.

### Key Observations:
1. **Diagonals in a Grid:**
   - For a grid of size n x n, there are 2n - 1 diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right.
   - Similarly, there are 2n - 1 diagonals running from top-right to bottom-left.
   - Total diagonals = (2n - 1) + (2n - 1) - 1 = 4n - 2 (subtracting 1 because the main diagonal is counted twice).

2. **Minimum Cells to Color:**
   - If k = 1, only one cell needs to be colored.
   - If k ≤ 2n, we can color cells in such a way that we cover k diagonals with the minimum number of cells. The formula `math.ceil(k / 2)` accounts for the fact that each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals (one from each direction).
   - If k > 2n, we need to cover more diagonals. The formula `k // 2 + 1` ensures that we cover the required diagonals efficiently. This is because after covering 2n diagonals with n cells, each additional cell can cover at most 2 diagonals, but we need to account for the odd cases where an extra cell is needed.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows the above logic:
- For k = 1, it directly prints 1.
- For k ≤ 2n, it uses `math.ceil(k / 2)` to determine the minimum cells.
- For k > 2n, it uses `k // 2 + 1` to determine the minimum cells.

### Testing the Program:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1: n = 3, k = 4**
   - k ≤ 2n (4 ≤ 6), so `math.ceil(4 / 2) = 2`.
   - Correct Output: 2

2. **Test Case 2: n = 3, k = 3**
   - k ≤ 2n (3 ≤ 6), so `math.ceil(3 / 2) = 2`.
   - Correct Output: 2

3. **Test Case 3: n = 3, k = 10**
   - k > 2n (10 > 6), so `10 // 2 + 1 = 6`.
   - Correct Output: 6

4. **Test Case 4: n = 3, k = 9**
   - k > 2n (9 > 6), so `9 // 2 + 1 = 5`.
   - Correct Output: 5

5. **Test Case 5: n = 4, k = 7**
   - k > 2n (7 > 8), so `7 // 2 + 1 = 4`.
   - Correct Output: 4

6. **Test Case 6: n = 7, k = 11**
   - k > 2n (11 > 14), so `11 // 2 + 1 = 6`.
   - Correct Output: 6

7. **Test Case 7: n = 2, k = 3**
   - k > 2n (3 > 4), so `3 // 2 + 1 = 2`.
   - Correct Output: 2

All test cases match the expected outputs based on the problem description and the logic of the program.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to ensure at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

Correctness: **True**
