You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of four integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively.
def func():

        cnt = 0
        
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: a list of t integers, each representing the final value of `cnt` for the respective test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
- Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
- Eve removes one number at a time, and we need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

### Key Points:
- XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the count of each bit position that contributes to the XOR is even.
- Numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in binary are:
  - 1: `001`
  - 2: `010`
  - 3: `011`
  - 4: `100`
- The XOR of the sequence will be zero if and only if the counts of each bit position (0th, 1st, and 2nd) are all even.

### Program Analysis:
The program seems to be counting the number of times Bob can win by:
1. Checking if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd. If so, it increments the count by 1 because removing one of each would make the counts even.
2. Adding half the count of each number to the result, presumably to account for pairs that can be removed to make the counts even.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Initial XOR Check**: The program does not explicitly check the initial XOR of the sequence. It assumes that if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd, Bob can win initially, which is not necessarily true. The initial XOR could be zero even if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are not all odd.
2. **Handling of Zeros**: The program does not account for the presence of zeros in the sequence. Zeros do not affect the XOR, but they should be considered in the overall count of numbers.
3. **Optimal Removal**: The program does not ensure that the removals are optimal to maximize Bob's wins. It simply adds half the count of each number, which may not be the best strategy in all cases.

### Testing the Program:
Let's consider a test case where the initial XOR is zero, but the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are not all odd:
- Input: `0 1 1 0`
- Expected Output: `1` (Bob wins initially because the XOR of `1` and `1` is `0`)
- Program Output: `1` (Correct in this case, but not guaranteed to be correct in all cases)

Let's consider another test case:
- Input: `1 1 1 1`
- Expected Output: `2` (Bob can win twice: first by removing one `1` and then by removing another `1`)
- Program Output: `1` (Incorrect)

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it does not account for the initial XOR value and does not ensure optimal removals to maximize Bob's wins.

### Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when the initial XOR is zero and when the optimal removal strategy is more complex than simply counting pairs.
