Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts four integers `p_i` (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively. The function returns the result for each test case based on the provided counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours.**
