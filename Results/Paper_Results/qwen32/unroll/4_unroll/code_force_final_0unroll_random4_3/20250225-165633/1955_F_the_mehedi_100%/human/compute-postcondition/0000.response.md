In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop will execute `t` times. The variables `p_i` (representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours) are not directly involved in the loop control; they are part of the input for each iteration of the loop.

To ensure the loop executes, we only need to adjust the state of `t` because it is the only variable in the loop head. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
