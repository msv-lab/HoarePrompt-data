The code calculates the value of `mid` based on the values of `big_element` and `small_element`. Given that `small_element` is `left + 1` and `big_element` is `right + 1`, the value of `mid` is derived from these expressions.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr), `clique` is an integer representing the clique number; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right + 1 - (left + 1) + 1) // 2`.**

In simpler terms, `mid` is calculated as `(right - left + 1) // 2`. The values of `left`, `right`, and `clique` remain unchanged, while `mid` is now defined by the given expression.
