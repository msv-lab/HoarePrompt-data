### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, the program code, and the annotations.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to assign distinct integers \(a_i\) to vertices \(i\) such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
- We need to add edges between vertices \(i\) and \(j\) if \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \leq k\).
- The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques, where each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
   - It calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes two arrays: `arr` for vertex values and `cliquess` for clique assignments.
   - It iterates through each clique and calls `make_array` to populate the arrays.

2. **Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`**:
   - It calculates `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` to distribute values.
   - It assigns values to `arr` and clique numbers to `cliquess`.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations describe the state of the program at key points.
- `arr` and `cliquess` are filled in blocks of size `k`, with the last block possibly smaller if `n` is not a multiple of `k`.
- The values in `arr` are assigned in a specific pattern, and `cliquess` assigns clique numbers accordingly.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Global Variables**:
   - The `arr` and `cliquess` arrays are used in `make_array` but are defined in `func_1`. This would cause an `UnboundLocalError` unless `arr` and `cliquess` are passed as parameters to `make_array` or declared as global variables.
   - The annotations do not mention these arrays being passed or declared as global, indicating a potential error.

2. **Logic for Assigning Values**:
   - The logic in `make_array` aims to distribute values in a way that respects the condition \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \leq k\).
   - However, the provided distribution strategy is not guaranteed to minimize the number of cliques. The distribution pattern might not ensure that all pairs within a clique satisfy the condition, especially for certain values of `n` and `k`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not explicitly handle edge cases, such as when `k` is very small or very large.
   - It is crucial to ensure that the program works correctly for all valid inputs within the given constraints.

#### Verification Using Annotations:
- The annotations confirm that `arr` and `cliquess` are filled in blocks of size `k`.
- However, the annotations do not provide a detailed verification of whether the condition \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \leq k\) is satisfied for all pairs within each clique.
- The annotations also do not confirm if the number of cliques is minimized.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the identified issues, particularly the use of global variables and the lack of clarity in the distribution strategy, the provided program is not guaranteed to be correct for all test cases as described in the problem statement.

**Final: False**
