### Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem by assigning distinct integers to vertices and then partitioning the graph into the minimum number of cliques based on the given constraints. Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n` (number of vertices) and `k`.
   - It then calls `func_1(n, k)` to handle the logic for that test case.

2. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
   - It calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`. This is because each clique can have at most `k` vertices, so the minimum number of cliques is the ceiling of `n / k`.
   - It initializes two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of size `n` and filled with zeros initially.
   - It then iterates through the range of `cliques` and calls `make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)` for each `i`. This function is supposed to fill the `arr` and `cliquess` lists for each clique.

3. **Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`**:
   - It calculates `small_element` as `left + 1` and `big_element` as `right + 1`.
   - It calculates `mid` as half the number of elements in the current segment and `not_mid` as the remaining elements.
   - It fills the first half of the segment in `arr` with values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` and the second half with values from `big_element` down to `big_element - not_mid + 1`.
   - It also sets the corresponding elements in `cliquess` to the current clique number.

### Issues and Correctness:
- **Assignment of `arr`**: The function `make_array` assigns values to `arr` and `cliquess` correctly within the specified range. However, it does not ensure that the values in `arr` are distinct across different segments. This is a critical issue because the problem requires all `a_i` to be distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
- **Partitioning into Cliques**: The function `make_array` correctly assigns clique numbers to vertices, but the incorrect assignment of values in `arr` can lead to incorrect edges being added to the graph, thus leading to incorrect clique partitions.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly ensure that all `a_i` are distinct integers from 1 to `n`. This is a crucial requirement for the problem, and the current implementation fails to meet this condition. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
