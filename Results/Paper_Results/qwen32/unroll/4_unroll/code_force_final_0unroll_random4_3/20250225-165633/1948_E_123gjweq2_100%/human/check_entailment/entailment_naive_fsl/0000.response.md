Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Global Variables**: The functions `func_1` and `make_array` use global variables `arr` and `cliquess`. These variables are not defined within the functions or passed as arguments, which can lead to undefined behavior and incorrect results.

2. **Incorrect Array Initialization**: The arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized with `0` values, but the problem requires distinct integers from 1 to n for `arr` and valid clique identifiers for `cliquess`.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Clique Size**: The number of cliques is calculated using `ceil(n / k)`, which may not be optimal for minimizing the number of cliques. The code does not guarantee the minimum number of cliques, which is a key requirement of the problem.

4. **Incorrect Array Population**: The `make_array` function does not correctly populate the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays. The logic for assigning values to `arr` and `cliquess` does not ensure that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is met for all pairs of vertices within the same clique.

5. **Output Format**: The code prints the results directly within the function, which is not the expected behavior. The function should return the results, and the main part of the code should handle the input/output operations.

6. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases properly. For example, when `k` is large relative to `n`, the code should be able to partition the graph into a single clique, but the current logic does not handle this scenario correctly.

### Example of Incorrectness:

Consider the input:
```
2
4 5
4 1
```

The expected output could be:
```
1 2 3 4
1
1 1 1 1
1 3 2 4
2
1 2 1 2
```

However, the provided code will not produce the correct output because of the issues mentioned above. For instance, the code may not correctly assign values to `arr` and `cliquess`, leading to incorrect cliques and partitions.

### Conclusion:
The code does not meet the problem requirements in several ways, including incorrect array initialization, logic for array population, and handling of edge cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
