### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program using the problem description, the provided code, the annotations, and the original assessment.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_2()`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3()`.
   - For each throw, it reads `r` and `c` using `func_1().split()`, converting `r` to an integer and leaving `c` as a string.

2. **Processing Throws:**
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it creates a temporary set `temp` to store possible positions of the ball after the throw.
   - For each player `q` in the current set `ans`, it checks the direction `c`:
     - If `c` is `'0'` or `'?'`, it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to `temp`.
     - If `c` is `'1'` or `'?'`, it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.
   - After processing all players in `ans`, it updates `ans` to be `temp`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program checks if `0` is in `ans` (which can happen due to the modulo operation) and replaces it with `n` if necessary. This ensures that player numbers are in the range `[1, n]`.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the number of possible players who could have the ball (`len(ans)`) and the sorted list of these players.

#### Correctness Verification:

- **Initialization:** The starting player `x` is correctly initialized in the set `ans`.
- **Direction Handling:** The program correctly handles both clockwise (`'0'`) and counterclockwise (`'1'`) directions, as well as the unknown direction (`'?'`).
- **Modulo Operation:** The use of modulo operation ensures that the player positions wrap around the circle correctly.
- **Edge Case Handling:** The program correctly handles the edge case where the modulo operation results in `0` by converting it to `n`.
- **Output:** The program outputs the correct number of possible players and their sorted list.

### Annotations Validation:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: The function correctly reads a line of input and strips whitespace.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: The function correctly converts the input string to an integer.
- **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: The function correctly splits the input string into a list of integers.
- **Function 4 (`func_4`)**: The function correctly processes the throws, updates the set of possible players, and handles edge cases.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws, considering all possible directions for throws marked with `'?'`. The annotations align with the program's behavior, and no issues are identified in the implementation.

**Final:** **True**
