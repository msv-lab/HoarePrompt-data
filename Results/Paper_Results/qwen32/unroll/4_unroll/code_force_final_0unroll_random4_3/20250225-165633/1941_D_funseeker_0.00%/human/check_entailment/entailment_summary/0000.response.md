### Reasoning:

Let's analyze each function and how they work together to solve the problem.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Reads a line of input from standard input and removes any leading or trailing whitespace.
   - This function is responsible for reading a single line of input at a time.
   - **Functionality**: Correct.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Calls `func_1` to read a line of input and converts it to an integer.
   - This function is used to read a single integer, which represents the number of test cases.
   - **Functionality**: Correct.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - Calls `func_1` to read a line of input, splits the line by whitespace, and converts each substring to an integer.
   - This function is used to read a line of integers and return them as a list.
   - **Functionality**: Correct.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - Reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the initial player `x`.
   - Initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x`.
   - For each throw, reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - Updates the set `ans` by adding the possible positions of the ball after the throw, considering both clockwise and counterclockwise directions if the direction is unknown (`'?'`).
   - Adjusts the set to ensure that player `0` is replaced by player `n` if present.
   - Prints the number of possible final positions and the sorted list of those positions.
   - **Functionality**: Correct.

### Integration and Edge Cases:
- The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case independently.
- For each test case, it correctly computes the possible positions of the ball after all throws, considering all possible directions for unknown throws.
- The program handles the modulo operation correctly to ensure the positions wrap around the circle.
- The final output for each test case is the number of possible final positions and the sorted list of those positions.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It reads the input, processes each throw, and computes the possible final positions of the ball, considering all possible directions for unknown throws. The output format matches the problem's requirements.

**Correctness: True**
