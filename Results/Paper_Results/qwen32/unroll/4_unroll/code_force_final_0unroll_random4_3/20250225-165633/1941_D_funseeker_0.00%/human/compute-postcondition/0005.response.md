The code `ans.discard(0)` removes the value `0` from the set `ans` if it is present. Given that `0` was initially in `ans`, it will be removed. The variables `n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged; `ans` is a set of values generated by the loop operations, excluding `0`; `r` and `c` are the values from the last iteration of the loop.**
