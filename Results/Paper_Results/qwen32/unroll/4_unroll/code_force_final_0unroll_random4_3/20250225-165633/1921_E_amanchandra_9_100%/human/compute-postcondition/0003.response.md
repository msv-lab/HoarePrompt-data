The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b`. Here, `h` and `w` are the dimensions of a rectangle, and `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)` are the coordinates of two distinct points within this rectangle. The function processes these test cases and returns a value for each one based on the given conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and `t` sets of six integers each (`h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`). For each test case, it processes the dimensions of a rectangle and the coordinates of two distinct points within it, and returns a result based on these inputs.**
