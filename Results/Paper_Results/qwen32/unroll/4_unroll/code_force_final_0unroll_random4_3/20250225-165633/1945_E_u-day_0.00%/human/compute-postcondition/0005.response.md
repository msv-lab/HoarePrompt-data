The code assigns the value `0` to `low` and `n - 1` to `high`. The values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, and `pos` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise `-1`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `n - 1`.**
