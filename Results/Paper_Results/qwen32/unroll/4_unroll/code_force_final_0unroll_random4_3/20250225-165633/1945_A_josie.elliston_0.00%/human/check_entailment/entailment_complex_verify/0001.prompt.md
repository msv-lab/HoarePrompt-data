You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three non-negative integer parameters representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. It returns -1 if a specific calculation involving extroverts and universals results in None; otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts and the result of that calculation.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Introverts (a)**: Each introvert requires a tent by themselves.
2. **Extroverts (b)**: Each extrovert requires a tent with exactly two other people.
3. **Universals (c)**: Universals can be placed in a tent with 0, 1, or 2 others.

The goal is to determine the minimum number of tents required to accommodate everyone according to their preferences. If it's impossible, return -1.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
- `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`: This function calculates the number of tents required for extroverts and any additional universals to fulfill the requirement that extroverts are in tents with two other people.
- `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`: This function calculates the total number of tents required by adding the tents for introverts to the result from `func_1`.

#### Function `func_1`:
- If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, it checks if the remaining extroverts plus universals can form a tent together.
- If not, it returns `None`, indicating that it's impossible to fulfill the extroverts' requirement.
- Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3, which represents the number of tents needed.

#### Function `func_2`:
- It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
- If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns -1, indicating an impossible arrangement.
- Otherwise, it adds the number of tents for introverts (which is equal to the number of introverts, since each introvert needs a tent by themselves) to the result from `func_1`.

### Correctness Check:
Let's verify the program against the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**: `a=1, b=2, c=3`
   - `func_1(2, 3)` returns `ceil((2+3)/3) = 2` (two tents for extroverts and universals).
   - `func_2(1, 2, 3)` returns `1 + 2 = 3`.

2. **Example 2**: `a=1, b=4, c=1`
   - `func_1(4, 1)` returns `None` because 4 extroverts and 1 universal cannot form the required groups.
   - `func_2(1, 4, 1)` returns `-1`.

3. **Example 3**: `a=1, b=4, c=2`
   - `func_1(4, 2)` returns `ceil((4+2)/3) = 2`.
   - `func_2(1, 4, 2)` returns `1 + 2 = 3`.

4. **Example 4**: `a=1, b=1, c=1`
   - `func_1(1, 1)` returns `None` because 1 extrovert and 1 universal cannot form the required group.
   - `func_2(1, 1, 1)` returns `-1`.

5. **Example 5**: `a=1, b=3, c=2`
   - `func_1(3, 2)` returns `ceil((3+2)/3) = 2`.
   - `func_2(1, 3, 2)` returns `1 + 2 = 3`.

6. **Example 6**: `a=19, b=7, c=18`
   - `func_1(7, 18)` returns `ceil((7+18)/3) = 9`.
   - `func_2(19, 7, 18)` returns `19 + 9 = 28`.

7. **Example 7**: `a=0, b=0, c=0`
   - `func_1(0, 0)` returns `0`.
   - `func_2(0, 0, 0)` returns `0`.

8. **Example 8**: `a=7, b=0, c=0`
   - `func_1(0, 0)` returns `0`.
   - `func_2(7, 0, 0)` returns `7`.

9. **Example 9**: `a=0, b=24, c=0`
   - `func_1(24, 0)` returns `ceil(24/3) = 8`.
   - `func_2(0, 24, 0)` returns `0 + 8 = 8`.

10. **Example 10**: `a=1000000000, b=1000000000, c=1000000000`
    - `func_1(1000000000, 1000000000)` returns `ceil(2000000000/3) = 666666667`.
    - `func_2(1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000)` returns `1000000000 + 666666667 = 1666666667`.

All the examples match the expected output, indicating that the program correctly solves the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of tents required or determines if it's impossible to satisfy the participants' preferences.
