Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to account for situations where the number of universals is insufficient to pair with extroverts to form groups of three.

Let's consider a test case to illustrate the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
1
2 2 1
```

**Explanation of the Test Case:**
- There are 2 introverts, 2 extroverts, and 1 universal.
- Each introvert needs their own tent, so 2 tents are required for the introverts.
- Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two others. Since there is only 1 universal, it is impossible to form two groups of three with the extroverts and the available universal.

**Expected Output:**
```
-1
```

**Actual Output of the Program:**
The program will output `3` for this test case, which is incorrect. Here's why:

1. `func_1(extroverts=2, universals=1)` will return `1` because `(2 + 1) / 3` is `1` when rounded up.
2. `func_2(introverts=2, extroverts=2, universals=1)` will then return `2 + 1`, which is `3`.

However, as explained, it is impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences in this scenario, so the correct output should be `-1`.

Thus, the program does not handle this case correctly and is therefore incorrect.
