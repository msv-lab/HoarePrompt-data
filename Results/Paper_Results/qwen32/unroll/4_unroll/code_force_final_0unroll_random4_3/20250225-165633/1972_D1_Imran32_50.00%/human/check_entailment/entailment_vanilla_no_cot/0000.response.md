Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The function `func_1` appears to be calculating something related to divisors or a similar concept, but it does not implement the logic required to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To solve the problem, you would need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given constraints and check whether the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\) holds. Given the constraints, an efficient approach would be necessary to avoid a time complexity that is too high.

Here's a possible correct implementation:

```python
import math

def count_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    results.append(count_pairs(n, m))

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This implementation directly checks each pair \((a, b)\) and counts those that satisfy the given condition. However, this approach may not be efficient enough for the upper constraint limits. Further optimizations would be required to handle the maximum input sizes efficiently.
