Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, computes a value `ans` based on `n`, and prints the result. The computation involves adding to `n` the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for each `i` from 2 up to the square root of `n` plus one. The function does not return any value explicitly but outputs the computed `ans`.**
