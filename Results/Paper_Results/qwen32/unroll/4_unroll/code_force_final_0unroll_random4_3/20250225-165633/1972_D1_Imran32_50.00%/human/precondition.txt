n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function is called multiple times with different values of n and m, and the total number of test cases t satisfies 1 <= t <= 10^4. The sum of all n values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^6, and the sum of all m values across test cases also does not exceed 2 * 10^6.
