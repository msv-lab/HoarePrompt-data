### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to see if they align with the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Program:
```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = n
    root = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1
    for i in range(2, root + 1):
        cnt = i * i
        ans += (n + i) // cnt
    print(ans)
```

#### Annotations:
The annotations provide insights into the state of the program at various points:
- `t` is the number of test cases.
- `n` and `k` are read from input (note: `k` is used instead of `m`).
- `ans` is initialized to `n`.
- The loop runs from `2` to `sqrt(n) + 1`, and `ans` is updated based on the formula `(n + i) // (i * i)`.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Variable Naming**: The variable `k` is used instead of `m`. This is a clear mistake as per the problem statement.
2. **Logic**: The logic in the program does not match the problem's requirement. The program is not checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
3. **Loop and Calculation**: The loop and calculations inside the program do not address the problem's conditions. The provided program seems to be counting something related to divisors or multiples but not the specific condition given in the problem.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds. Here is a more accurate approach:

```python
import math

def count_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_pairs(n, m))
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The program is using incorrect variable names and performing calculations that do not align with the problem's conditions.

#### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect as it does not solve the problem as described.
