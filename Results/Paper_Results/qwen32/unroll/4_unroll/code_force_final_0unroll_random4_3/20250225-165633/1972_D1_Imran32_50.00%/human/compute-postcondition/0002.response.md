The code calculates the integer square root of `n` and adds 1 to it, assigning the result to the variable `root`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^6, `root` will be `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, which means `root` will be the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^6; `ans` is equal to `n`; `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.**
