Let's analyze the given program and the problem statement to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. A beautiful array can be transformed into an array with all identical elements by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

### Program Analysis:
The program attempts to solve this by:
1. Iterating through each test case.
2. For each array, it tries to find the minimum length of a contiguous segment of identical elements.
3. If the minimum length of such a segment is `inf` (which should not happen as the array is beautiful) or the length of the array itself (meaning the entire array consists of the same element), it outputs `-1`.
4. Otherwise, it outputs the minimum length of the segment.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Logic for Finding Minimum Segment Length**: The program incorrectly calculates the minimum length of a segment of identical elements. It does not correctly handle the case where the last segment of identical elements is the shortest, as it only updates `minn` when it encounters a different element.
2. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where the array is already not beautiful correctly. However, since the problem guarantees that the input array is beautiful, this is not an issue for the given problem constraints.
3. **Final Update for `minn`**: The program correctly updates `minn` with the last segment length after the loop, but the logic for determining the minimum length of a segment of identical elements is flawed.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the logic for finding the minimum segment length, the program is incorrect. It does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful.

### Correctness: **False**

To fix the program, one approach would be to correctly identify the minimum length of segments of identical elements and handle the edge cases properly. However, the current implementation does not achieve this.

Therefore, the final answer is:
Correctness: **False**
