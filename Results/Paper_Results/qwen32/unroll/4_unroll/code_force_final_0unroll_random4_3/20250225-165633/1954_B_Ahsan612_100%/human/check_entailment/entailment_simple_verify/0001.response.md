### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated version to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
- An array is **beautiful** if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.
- The task is to find the minimum number of elements to remove so that the array stops being beautiful.
- If it's impossible to make the array not beautiful, output `-1`.

#### Program Analysis:
The program iterates through each test case and for each array, it tries to find the minimum length of a contiguous segment of identical elements. It then uses this minimum length to determine if the array can be made not beautiful by removing elements.

#### Annotated Code Walkthrough:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `same` keeps track of the length of the current segment of identical elements.
   - `num` stores the current number being counted.
   - `minn` is initialized to `inf` to find the minimum segment length.
   - `i` is the index for iterating through the array.

2. **Loop Through Array**:
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is the same as `num`, increment `same`.
   - If `ar[i]` is different from `num`:
     - Increment `i` to move to the next element.
     - Update `num` to the new element.
     - Update `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
     - Reset `same` to `1`.
   - Increment `i` again to move to the next element.

3. **Final Update**:
   - After the loop, update `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same` to account for the last segment.
   - If `minn` is `inf` or equal to the length of the array, print `-1`.
   - Otherwise, print `minn`.

#### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Minimum Segment Calculation**: The program updates `minn` only when it encounters a different element, which means the last segment of identical elements might not be considered unless it is followed by a different element.
- **Handling Last Segment**: The final update `minn = min(minn, same)` ensures that the last segment is considered, but the logic for finding the minimum segment length is flawed as it does not correctly identify the shortest segment.
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where the array is already not beautiful, but since the problem guarantees the array is beautiful, this is not an issue.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
The program's logic for finding the minimum segment length is flawed. It does not correctly identify the shortest segment of identical elements, which is crucial for determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify the shortest segment of identical elements and ensure that the last segment is also considered. A correct approach would involve:
- Iterating through the array to find all segments of identical elements.
- Keeping track of the minimum length of these segments.
- Handling the last segment properly after the loop.

Given the identified issues, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
