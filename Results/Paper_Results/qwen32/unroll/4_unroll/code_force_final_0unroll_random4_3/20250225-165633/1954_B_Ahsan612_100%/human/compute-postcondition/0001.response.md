To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, let's break down the given code and understand what it does:

1. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. **Inner Loop**: For each test case, the code reads an integer `n` and a list `ar` of length `n`.
3. **Logic**:
   - It initializes `same` to 1, `num` to the first element of `ar`, and `minn` to infinity.
   - It then iterates through the list `ar` to find the minimum length of contiguous segments of the same number.
   - If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, it increments `same`.
   - If `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, it updates `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to `ar[i]`.
   - After the loop, it performs a final check to update `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
   - If `minn` is still infinity or equal to the length of `ar`, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

Since the code processes each test case independently and the output of each test case is printed immediately, the state of variables like `n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, and `minn` will be reset at the start of each test case. Therefore, after all test cases have been processed, the only variable that retains its value across iterations is `t`, which is the number of test cases.

The output state after the loop has finished executing all its iterations will be that all test cases have been processed, and the variable `t` remains unchanged. However, since the problem asks for the state of the variables in the loop head and body, and these variables are local to each iteration and get reset, they do not have a meaningful "final" state across all iterations.

Given the format requirement and the context, the output state can be described as:

Output State: **t is the number of test cases processed, and all other variables (n, ar, same, num, minn) are in their initial state or have been reset for the next test case.**
