Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly output the minimum and maximum of the two integers for each test case. Instead, it incorrectly prints the larger number first followed by the smaller number in every case.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 9
```
The program will output:
```
9 1
```
However, according to the problem description, the correct output should be:
```
1 9
```

This is because the program swaps the values of `x` and `y` regardless of their actual values. To fix this, the condition inside the loop should be corrected to print the minimum value first and then the maximum value. Here is the corrected part of the code:
```python
if x < y:
    print(x, y)
else:
    print(y, x)
```

With this correction, the program would work as expected for all test cases.
