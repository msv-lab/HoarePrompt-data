Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a logical error in the print statements within the if-else block. It should print the minimum value first, followed by the maximum value. However, the current implementation prints `x, y` when `x > y`, which is incorrect. It should print `y, x` in that case to ensure the minimum value comes first.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(y, x)
        else:
            print(x, y)

func()
```

In this corrected version, the program will correctly print the minimum value followed by the maximum value for each pair of integers `x` and `y`.
