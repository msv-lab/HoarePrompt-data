`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `t` is now a specific integer between 1 and 500, inclusive. The other variables (`n`, constraints) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is a specific integer between 1 and 500, inclusive; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; each constraint is described by a pair (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9; there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2; no two constraints are the same.**
