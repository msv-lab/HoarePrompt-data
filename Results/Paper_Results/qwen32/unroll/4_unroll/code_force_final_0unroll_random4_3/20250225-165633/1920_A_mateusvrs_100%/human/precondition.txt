There are t test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500). For each test case, there are n constraints (2 ≤ n ≤ 100). Each constraint is represented by two integers a and x, where a denotes the type of constraint (a ∈ {1, 2, 3}) and x is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). If a=1, k must be greater than or equal to x. If a=2, k must be less than or equal to x. If a=3, k must be not equal to x. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same (all pairs (a, x) are distinct).
