To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to understand the initial state provided and the structure of the list `r`.

Initial State: `r` is a list of integers where each integer is determined by the constraints provided in each iteration of the outer loop.

The `print(*r, sep='\n')` statement unpacks the list `r` and prints each element on a new line.

Since the exact values of the integers in the list `r` are not explicitly provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the list `r` itself. The `*r` syntax in the `print` function unpacks the list, and `sep='\n'` ensures that each element is printed on a new line.

Output: **each element of the list `r` on a new line (where `r` is a list of integers determined by the constraints provided in each iteration of the outer loop)**
