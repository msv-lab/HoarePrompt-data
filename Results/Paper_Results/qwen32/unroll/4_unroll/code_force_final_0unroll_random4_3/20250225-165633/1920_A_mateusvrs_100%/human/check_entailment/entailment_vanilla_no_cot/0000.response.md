Correctness: **False**

The program contains a logical error in the condition where it checks if `bx > ax`. If this condition is true, it appends `0` to the result list `r`, which is correct because it means there are no valid integers `k` that can satisfy all constraints. However, if `bx <= ax`, the program then calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the count of integers in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]` from the total possible integers in that range (`ax - bx + 1`). This calculation is mostly correct, but the program does not handle the case where `bx == ax` properly. If `bx == ax`, there is only one integer `k` to consider, and if this integer is in `cx`, the result should be `0`, not `1 - tmp`.

To fix the program, we need to add a condition to handle the case where `bx == ax`:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        cx = set()
        ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
        bx = -1
        for _ in range(n):
            (a, x) = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        if bx > ax:
            r.append(0)
        elif bx == ax:
            r.append(0 if bx in cx else 1)
        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
    print(*r, sep='\n')
```

With this fix, the program should correctly handle all edge cases and provide the correct output for the given problem.
