Output State: **After all iterations, the variables `t`, `tests`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` retain their initial values. The loop processes each test case by reading inputs for `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, and prints either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified. The variable `no` is a boolean flag used within each iteration to determine if a 'NO' should be printed, but it does not affect the overall state outside the loop.**
