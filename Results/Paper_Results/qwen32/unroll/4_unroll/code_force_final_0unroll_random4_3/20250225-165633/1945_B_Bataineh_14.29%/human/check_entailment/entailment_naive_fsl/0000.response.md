Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic in the code is flawed, especially in the handling of the cases where `m` is not less than `a` or `b`.

Here's a specific counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

Consider the test case:
```
1
2 3 4
```

According to the problem description:
- The first installation launches fireworks every 2 minutes: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...
- The second installation launches fireworks every 3 minutes: 3, 6, 9, 12, ...
- Each firework is visible for 5 minutes.

Let's analyze the visibility of fireworks at different times:
- At time 2: Only the first firework is visible.
- At time 3: Only the second firework is visible.
- At time 4: Only the first firework is visible.
- At time 5: Only the first firework is visible.
- At time 6: Both fireworks launched at times 2 and 3 are visible, and the first firework launched at time 4 is also visible, so three fireworks are visible.
- At time 7: Only the first firework launched at time 4 is visible.
- At time 8: Only the first firework launched at time 6 is visible.
- At time 9: Only the second firework launched at time 6 is visible.
- At time 10: Only the first firework launched at time 8 is visible.
- At time 11: Only the first firework launched at time 8 is visible.
- At time 12: Both fireworks launched at times 6 and 9 are visible, and the first firework launched at time 10 is also visible, so three fireworks are visible.

The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 3, not `m // a + m // b + 2` which evaluates to `4 // 2 + 4 // 3 + 2 = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5`.

Thus, the code does not correctly handle this case and therefore is incorrect.
