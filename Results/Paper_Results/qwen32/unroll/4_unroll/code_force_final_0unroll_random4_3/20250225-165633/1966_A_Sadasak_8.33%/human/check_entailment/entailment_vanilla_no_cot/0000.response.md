Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand after performing the allowed operations. Here are a few issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Frequencies**: The `func_1` function incorrectly caps the frequency of each number at `k`. This is not necessary and does not help in calculating the minimum number of cards that can be left. Instead, the program should calculate the frequency of each number and then determine how many cards can be reduced based on the operations allowed.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Cards**: The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards that can be left. The key insight is that for each unique number `num` with a frequency `freq`, you can reduce the number of cards by `freq // (k - 1)` times, and the remainder `freq % (k - 1)` will be the number of cards left for that number.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, if all cards have the same number, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations.

Here is a revised version of the program that correctly implements the logic:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Calculate frequency of each number
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of cards left
    min_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        min_cards += count % (k - 1)
        if min_cards == 0:
            min_cards = k - 1
    
    print(min_cards)
```

This revised program correctly calculates the minimum number of cards left by considering the remainder of the frequency of each number when divided by `k - 1`. If the total remainder is zero, it means all cards can be completely reduced, and we should return `k - 1` as the minimum number of cards left (since we can't have zero cards).
