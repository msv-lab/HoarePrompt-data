Let's analyze the problem, the provided code, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to minimize the number of cards left by repeatedly exchanging any `k` cards with the same number for `k-1` cards of any number. The goal is to find the minimum number of cards that can remain after performing these operations.

### Code Analysis
The provided code has the following structure:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list of card numbers.
3. It then checks if `k` is greater than `n` or if `k` equals `n` and prints `n` or `k-1` respectively.
4. Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to get a frequency table of the cards, capping the frequency at `k`.
5. It checks if `k` is in the frequency values and prints `k-1` if true, else it prints `n`.

### Function Summary
The function `func_1` creates a frequency table where the frequency of each card number is capped at `k`.

### Issues with the Provided Code
1. **Incorrect Frequency Handling**: The function `func_1` caps the frequency at `k`, which does not help in determining the minimum number of cards left. Instead, we need to determine how many full groups of `k` cards can be formed and calculate the remaining cards.
2. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Cards**: The main logic incorrectly checks if `k` is in the frequency values and returns `k-1` if true, which is not the correct condition to determine the minimum number of cards left. Instead, we need to sum the remainders of the counts of each card number when divided by `k`.

### Correct Approach
The correct approach involves:
1. Calculating the frequency of each card number.
2. For each card number, determine the remainder when the frequency is divided by `k` (i.e., `count % k`).
3. Summing these remainders gives the minimum number of cards left. If the sum is zero, we need to ensure at least one card is left.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the code:
```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    remaining_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        remaining_cards += count % k  # Add the remainder of the cards that cannot form a group of k
    
    # We need to ensure that we do not end up with zero cards, so we need at least one card left
    if remaining_cards == 0:
        remaining_cards = 1
    
    print(remaining_cards)
```
