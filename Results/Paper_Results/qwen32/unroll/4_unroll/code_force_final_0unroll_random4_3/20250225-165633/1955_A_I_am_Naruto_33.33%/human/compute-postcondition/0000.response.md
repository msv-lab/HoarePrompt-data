To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `_` in the `for` loop statement. However, the loop's execution is actually determined by the value provided by `int(input())`, which corresponds to the variable `t` in the problem statement. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is set to a value that allows the loop to execute at least once.

Given the problem statement, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1.

The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are mentioned in the problem statement but are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition. They are likely used within the loop body, which is not provided. Therefore, we do not need to adjust their states for the loop to execute.

So, the only state we need to ensure is that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**

Since the requirement is to ensure the loop executes, we can specify that `t` must be at least 1:

State: **`t` is 1**
