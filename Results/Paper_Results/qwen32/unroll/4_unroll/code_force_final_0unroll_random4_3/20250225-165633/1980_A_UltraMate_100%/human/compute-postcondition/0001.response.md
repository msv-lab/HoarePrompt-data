The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in Python for iteration and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
