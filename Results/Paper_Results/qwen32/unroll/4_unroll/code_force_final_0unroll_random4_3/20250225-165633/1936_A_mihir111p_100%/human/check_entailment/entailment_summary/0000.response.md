### Reasoning:

The program aims to find two indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i âŠ• p_j` is maximized, using at most `3n` queries. Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. **Finding `ans1`:**
   - The program initializes `ans1` to 0.
   - It iterates over all indices `i` from 1 to `n-1`.
   - For each `i`, it performs a query with `func_1(ans1, ans1, i, i)`, which compares `(p_ans1 | p_ans1)` with `(p_i | p_i)`.
   - Since `(p_ans1 | p_ans1) == p_ans1` and `(p_i | p_i) == p_i`, the query essentially compares `p_ans1` with `p_i`.
   - If the result of the query is `<`, it means `p_ans1 < p_i`, so it updates `ans1` to `i`.
   - After the loop, `ans1` will be the index of the maximum element in the permutation `p`.

2. **Finding `mx` and `v`:**
   - The program initializes `mx` to 0 and `v` to `[0]`.
   - It iterates over all indices `i` from 1 to `n-1`.
   - For each `i`, it performs a query with `func_1(mx, ans1, i, ans1)`, which compares `(p_mx | p_ans1)` with `(p_i | p_ans1)`.
   - If the result of the query is `<`, it means `p_mx | p_ans1 < p_i | p_ans1`. Since `p_ans1` is the maximum element, `p_mx < p_i`, so it updates `mx` to `i` and resets `v` to `[i]`.
   - If the result of the query is `=`, it means `p_mx | p_ans1 == p_i | p_ans1`. Since `p_ans1` is the maximum element, `p_mx == p_i`, so it adds `i` to `v`.
   - After the loop, `mx` will be the index of one of the maximum elements in the permutation `p` and `v` will contain all indices of the maximum elements.

3. **Finding `ans`:**
   - The program initializes `mx` to the first element of `v` and `ans` to the first element of `v`.
   - It iterates over all indices `i` from 1 to `len(v) - 1`.
   - For each `i`, it performs a query with `func_1(ans, ans, v[i], v[i])`, which compares `(p_ans | p_ans)` with `(p_v[i] | p_v[i])`.
   - Since `(p_ans | p_ans) == p_ans` and `(p_v[i] | p_v[i]) == p_v[i]`, the query essentially compares `p_ans` with `p_v[i]`.
   - If the result of the query is `>`, it means `p_ans > p_v[i]`, so it updates `ans` to `v[i]`.
   - After the loop, `ans` will be the index of the maximum element in `v`, which is also the maximum element in the permutation `p`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program outputs `! ans ans1`, which is the pair of indices where `p_ans` and `p_ans1` are both maximum elements in the permutation `p`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the maximum element in the permutation `p` and outputs a pair of indices where both elements are maximum, ensuring that their XOR is maximized (since XOR of a number with itself is 0, and XOR of a number with a different maximum is maximized). The number of queries used is `2n - 1` (one for finding `ans1` and `n - 1` for finding `mx` and `v`), which is within the allowed `3n` queries.

**Correctness: True**
