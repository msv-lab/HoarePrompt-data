To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the condition `p <= num`. The variables `p` and `num` are the only ones involved in the loop condition.

Given:
- `num` is a non-negative integer.
- `p` is initialized to 2.

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `p <= num` must be true. Since `p` is initialized to 2, `num` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop condition is `p <= num`.
2. `p` is initialized to 2.
3. For the loop to execute, `num` must be at least 2.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `num` is at least 2.

State: **`num` must be at least 2; `prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements where the first two elements are `False` and the rest are `True`; `Highest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, all set to `0`; `Lowest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, all set to `0`; `p` is 2.**
