Precondition: **num is a non-negative integer.**

Note: The function `func_11` appears to be generating a list of prime numbers up to `num`, but it does not directly contribute to solving the described problem about maximizing triangular pieces of cake. The precondition is based solely on the function signature and the variable `num`.
