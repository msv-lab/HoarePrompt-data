The code snippet initializes a new list called `Lowest_Prime` with `num + 1` elements, all set to `0`. The other variables (`num`, `prime`, and `Highest_Prime`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer; `prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, all set to `True`; `Highest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, all set to `0`; `Lowest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, all set to `0`.**
