The code initializes a list `Highest_Prime` with `num + 1` elements, all set to `0`. The other variables, `num` and `prime`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer; `prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, all set to `True`; `Highest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, all set to `0`.**
