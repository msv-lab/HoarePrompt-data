You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        print(a)
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1), where a_i = 0 indicates that the i-th cell is free and a_i = 1 indicates that the i-th cell contains a chip. It is guaranteed that in each test case, there is at least one cell that contains a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = 0
        
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        
        print(a)
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: the modified list `a` and the count `res` for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of cells where each cell is either free (0) or contains a chip (1). For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of free cells between the first and last chip in the list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list `a` representing the cells.

2. **Trimming Leading and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program trims leading zeros by repeatedly popping the first element of `a` as long as it is `0`.
   - Similarly, it trims trailing zeros by repeatedly popping the last element of `a` as long as it is `0`.
   - This step ensures that the list `a` now contains only the relevant segment with chips and free cells between them.

3. **Counting Operations:**
   - The program initializes `res` to `0`, which will store the number of operations needed.
   - It then iterates through the trimmed list `a` and counts the number of `0`s.
   - Each `0` encountered in the trimmed list represents a free cell that a chip will have to move past to form a contiguous block.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the count of `0`s for each test case, which corresponds to the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single contiguous block.

### Correctness Analysis

- **Trimming Zeros:** Trimming leading and trailing zeros is a valid step because it reduces the problem to the smallest segment that contains chips and the free cells between them. This is crucial because operations are only meaningful within this segment.
  
- **Counting Free Cells:** Counting the number of `0`s in the trimmed list is the correct approach to determine the minimum number of operations. Each `0` represents a free cell that a chip will have to move past to form a contiguous block.

- **Edge Cases:** The program handles edge cases such as all chips already in a block (no `0`s in the trimmed list), which results in `0` operations.

- **Output:** The program prints the result for each test case as required.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single contiguous block. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
