Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations to move the chips into a single block. The logic for counting the number of operations is flawed. Specifically, the program counts all free cells within the trimmed list of chips (after removing leading and trailing free cells), but this does not account for the actual movement of chips to form a contiguous block.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        last_position = -1
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == 1:
                if last_position != -1:
                    res += i - last_position - 1
                last_position = i
        
        print(res)

func()
```

This corrected version keeps track of the last position of a chip and calculates the number of free cells between consecutive chips, which is the correct way to determine the minimum number of operations needed.
