The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `t` needs to be adjusted to ensure that it is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not need any specific initial state.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000**
