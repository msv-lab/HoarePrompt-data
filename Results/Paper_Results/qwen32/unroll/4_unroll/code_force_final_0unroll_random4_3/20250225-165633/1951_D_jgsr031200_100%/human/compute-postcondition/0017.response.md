Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

Initial State:
- `n` is 0
- `k` remains unchanged (but its value is not explicitly given, so we will consider it as a constant value that doesn't change)
- `costs` is a list defined as `[n - k + 1, 1]`
- `h` is defined as `k + 1`
- It is mentioned that `h` is not less than `k`, which aligns with the definition of `h` as `k + 1` (since `k + 1` is always greater than `k`).

The print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. The values of `n`, `k`, `costs`, and `h` do not affect the output of this specific print statement because it is printing a hardcoded string.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **YES**
