The `print(2)` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `n`, `k`, `costs`, or `h`. The value to be printed is explicitly specified as `2`.

Here is the step-by-step explanation:

1. The initial state provides values and relationships for the variables `n`, `k`, `costs`, and `h`.
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` remains unchanged (its value is not specified but it doesnâ€™t affect the print statement).
   - `costs` is a list defined as `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - `h` is defined as `k + 1` and it is not less than `k`.

2. The `print(2)` statement is independent of the values of `n`, `k`, `costs`, and `h`. It simply prints the integer `2`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **2**
