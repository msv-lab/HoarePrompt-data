Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

Initial State:
- `n` is 0.
- `k` remains unchanged (its value is not specified but it is not modified in the initial state).
- `costs` is defined as `[n - k + 1, 1]`, which simplifies to `[-k + 1, 1]` because `n` is 0.
- `h` is defined as `k + 1`.
- It is stated that `h` is less than `k`. However, this seems contradictory because if `h` is `k + 1`, then `h` should always be greater than `k` unless `k` is negative or there is some other context not provided here. For the sake of this problem, we will assume the provided values and focus on the print statement.

The print statement:
```python
print('NO')
```

The print statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`. It does not depend on the values of `n`, `k`, `costs`, or `h`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **NO**
