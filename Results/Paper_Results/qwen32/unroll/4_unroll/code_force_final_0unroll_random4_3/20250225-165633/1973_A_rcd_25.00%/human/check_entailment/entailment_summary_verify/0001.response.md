### Reasoning:

The original assessment provides a detailed breakdown of the logic used in the program and tests it against several examples. Let's verify the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Total Points Check**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores is even. If it's not, it correctly outputs `-1` because an odd total score is impossible under the given rules.
   - This part of the program is correct.

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the program outputs `p1 + p2`. This logic is based on the idea that the highest score could have been achieved by beating both other players and also drawing with each of them. This is a valid approach because the total points from draws and wins must match the given scores.
   - If `p3 < p1 + p2`, the program calculates a range of possible draws (`low` to `high`) and checks for feasibility. It iterates from `low` to `high` to find a valid number of draws (`cur`) such that the remaining scores after accounting for draws are feasible. The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` ensures that the remaining scores are consistent with the given scores.
   - If no such `cur` is found, it defaults to `p3`. This part of the logic ensures that the program covers all possible scenarios and finds the maximum number of draws if possible.

3. **Testing the Program**:
   - The program is tested with several examples provided in the problem description. It correctly handles all the test cases, including edge cases like `0 0 0` and `1 1 10`.

4. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary correctly describes the logic of the program, including the total points check and the calculation of the maximum possible draws.

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or detect if the scores are invalid. The function summary aligns with the behavior of the program, and the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
