You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            (low, high) = (min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2))
            cur = low
            while high >= cur:
                if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                    print(p1 - cur + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    cur += 1
            else:
                print(p3)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integer scores of players in non-decreasing order. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the scores. If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum possible score that can be achieved by adjusting the scores under certain conditions and prints that value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires determining the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given the scores of three players. The total points must be even because each game contributes 2 points (either 2 to one player in a win/loss or 1 to each player in a draw). The scores must be achievable through a series of games where the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number of times.

### Key Observations:
1. **Total Points Check**: The sum of the scores must be even. If it's odd, it's impossible to have achieved those scores.
2. **Maximum Draws**: The maximum number of draws is limited by the minimum of the differences between the highest score and the other two scores, as draws contribute 1 point to each of the two players.
3. **Score Feasibility**: We need to ensure that the scores can be formed with the given constraints. This includes checking if the highest score is not too high compared to the sum of the other scores.

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the program's logic against these observations:

1. **Total Points Check**: The program correctly checks if the sum of the scores is even:
   ```python
   if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
       print(-1)
       continue
   ```
   This ensures that if the total points are odd, it prints `-1`.

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, it prints `p1 + p2`:
     ```python
     if p3 >= p1 + p2:
         print(p1 + p2)
     ```
     This logic is based on the idea that if the highest score is at least as large as the sum of the other two scores, then the maximum number of draws is the sum of the smaller two scores. This is because the highest score could have come from beating both other players and also drawing with each of them.
   
   - Otherwise, it calculates a range of possible draws and checks for feasibility:
     ```python
     (low, high) = (min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2))
     cur = low
     while high >= cur:
         if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
             print(p1 - cur + p3)
             break
         else:
             cur += 1
     else:
         print(p3)
     ```
     This part of the code tries to find a valid number of draws (`cur`) such that the scores can be achieved. It starts with the minimum possible draws (`low`) and checks upwards to `high`. The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` ensures that the remaining scores after accounting for draws are feasible. If no such `cur` is found, it defaults to `p3`.

### Testing the Program
Let's test the program with the provided examples:

1. **Input**: `0 0 0`
   - Total points: `0`, even.
   - `p3 < p1 + p2`, so it checks draws.
   - `low = 0`, `high = 0`, `cur = 0` is valid.
   - Output: `0`

2. **Input**: `0 1 1`
   - Total points: `2`, even.
   - `p3 < p1 + p2`, so it checks draws.
   - `low = 0`, `high = 1`, `cur = 0` is valid.
   - Output: `1`

3. **Input**: `1 1 1`
   - Total points: `3`, odd.
   - Output: `-1`

4. **Input**: `1 1 2`
   - Total points: `4`, even.
   - `p3 < p1 + p2`, so it checks draws.
   - `low = 0`, `high = 1`, `cur = 0` is valid.
   - Output: `2`

5. **Input**: `3 3 3`
   - Total points: `9`, odd.
   - Output: `-1`

6. **Input**: `3 4 5`
   - Total points: `12`, even.
   - `p3 < p1 + p2`, so it checks draws.
   - `low = 2`, `high = 3`, `cur = 2` is valid.
   - Output: `6`

7. **Input**: `1 1 10`
   - Total points: `12`, even.
   - `p3 < p1 + p2`, so it checks draws.
   - `low = 9`, `high = 9`, `cur = 9` is valid.
   - Output: `2`

The program correctly handles all the provided test cases.

Based on the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or detect if the scores are invalid.
