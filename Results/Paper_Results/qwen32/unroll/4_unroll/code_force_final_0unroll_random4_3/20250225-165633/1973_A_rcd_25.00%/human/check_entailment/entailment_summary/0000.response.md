### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given the scores of three players, ensuring that the scores are consistent with the rules of the game. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Sum of Scores Check**: The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because the points awarded in the game (2 for a win, 1 for a draw) always result in an even sum. If the sum is odd, it's impossible to achieve these scores through a valid set of games.

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2`. This is because the highest score `p3` could have been achieved by playing against the other two players, and the remaining points (if any) could be distributed as draws between those other two players.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the difference between `p3` and the other scores (`low` and `high`). It then iterates to find a valid configuration where the points can be distributed such that the conditions of the game are satisfied. Specifically, it checks if `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` to ensure that the remaining points can be distributed as draws between the players.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles several edge cases, such as no games played (`p1 = p2 = p3 = 0`), cases where the scores are not achievable (`p1 = 1, p2 = 1, p3 = 1`), and cases where the maximum number of draws is possible (`p1 = 1, p2 = 1, p3 = 2`).

By analyzing the logic, the program seems to correctly implement the rules and constraints of the game. The execution summary aligns with the described logic, indicating that the program processes each test case appropriately.
