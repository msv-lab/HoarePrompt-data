Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integer scores of players in non-decreasing order. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the scores. If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum possible score that can be achieved by adjusting the scores under certain conditions and prints that value.**
