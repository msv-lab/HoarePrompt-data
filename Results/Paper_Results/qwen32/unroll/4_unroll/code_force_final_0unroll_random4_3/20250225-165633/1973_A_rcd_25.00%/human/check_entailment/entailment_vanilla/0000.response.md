To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires determining the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given the scores of three players. The total points must be even because each game contributes 2 points (either 2 to one player in a win/loss or 1 to each player in a draw). The scores must be achievable through a series of games where the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number of times.

### Key Observations:
1. **Total Points Check**: The sum of the scores must be even. If it's odd, it's impossible to have achieved those scores.
2. **Maximum Draws**: The maximum number of draws is limited by the minimum of the differences between the highest score and the other two scores, as draws contribute 1 point to each of the two players.
3. **Score Feasibility**: We need to ensure that the scores can be formed with the given constraints. This includes checking if the highest score is not too high compared to the sum of the other scores.

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the program's logic against these observations:

1. **Total Points Check**: The program correctly checks if the sum of the scores is even:
   ```python
   if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
       print(-1)
       continue
   ```
   This ensures that if the total points are odd, it prints `-1`.

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, it prints `p1 + p2`:
     ```python
     if p3 >= p1 + p2:
         print(p1 + p2)
     ```
     This logic is based on the idea that if the highest score is at least as large as the sum of the other two scores, then the maximum number of draws is the sum of the smaller two scores. This is because the highest score could have come from beating both other players and also drawing with each of them.
   
   - Otherwise, it calculates a range of possible draws and checks for feasibility:
     ```python
     (low, high) = (min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2))
     cur = low
     while high >= cur:
         if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
             print(p1 - cur + p3)
             break
         else:
             cur += 1
     else:
         print(p3)
     ```
     This part of the code tries to find a valid number of draws (`cur`) such that the scores can be achieved. It starts with the minimum possible draws (`low`) and checks upwards to `high`. The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` ensures that the remaining scores after accounting for draws are feasible. If no such `cur` is found, it defaults to `p3`.

### Testing the Program
Let's test the program with the provided examples:

1. **Input**: `0 0 0`
   - Total points: `0`, even.
   - `p3 < p1 + p2`, so it checks draws.
   - `low = 0`, `high = 0`, `cur = 0` is valid.
   - Output: `0`

2. **Input**: `0 1 1`
   - Total points: `2`, even.
   - `p3 < p1 + p2`, so it checks draws.
   - `low = 0`, `high = 1`, `cur = 0` is valid.
   - Output: `1`

3. **Input**: `1 1 1`
   - Total points: `3`, odd.
   - Output: `-1`

4. **Input**: `1 1 2`
   - Total points: `4`, even.
   - `p3 < p1 + p2`, so it checks draws.
   - `low = 0`, `high = 1`, `cur = 0` is valid.
   - Output: `2`

5. **Input**: `3 3 3`
   - Total points: `9`, odd.
   - Output: `-1`

6. **Input**: `3 4 5`
   - Total points: `12`, even.
   - `p3 < p1 + p2`, so it checks draws.
   - `low = 2`, `high = 3`, `cur = 2` is valid.
   - Output: `6`

7. **Input**: `1 1 10`
   - Total points: `12`, even.
   - `p3 < p1 + p2`, so it checks draws.
   - `low = 9`, `high = 9`, `cur = 9` is valid.
   - Output: `2`

The program correctly handles all the provided test cases.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or detect if the scores are invalid.

Correctness: **True**
