The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times, and its initial value does not need to be adjusted as it is set by the `range` function during each iteration.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are not relevant to the execution of the loop itself, as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
