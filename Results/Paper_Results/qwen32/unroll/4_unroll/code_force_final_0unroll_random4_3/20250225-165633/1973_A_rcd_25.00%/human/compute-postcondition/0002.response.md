To determine the output state, let's analyze the code and how it processes each test case:

1. **Input Reading**: For each of the `t` test cases, three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are read.
2. **Sum Check**: The code first checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` and moves to the next test case.
3. **Direct Calculation**: If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, it prints the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
4. **Loop for Calculation**: If `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the code enters a loop to find the correct value to print:
   - It calculates `low` and `high` based on the differences between `p3` and `p1` and `p3` and `p2`.
   - It then iterates from `low` to `high` to find the value `cur` such that `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`. When this condition is met, it prints `p1 - cur + p3`.
   - If no such `cur` is found in the loop, it prints `p3`.

The variables `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are modified during the loop, but after all iterations, the only state that remains is the count of test cases `t`, which would be `0` because all test cases have been processed.

Output State: **t is 0.**
