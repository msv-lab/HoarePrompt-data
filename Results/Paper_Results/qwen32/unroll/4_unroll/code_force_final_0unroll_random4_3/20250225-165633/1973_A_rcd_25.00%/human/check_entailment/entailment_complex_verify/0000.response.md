Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotated version to ensure everything aligns with the problem description and the expected behavior.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Three friends play chess.
- Each game results in either 2 points to the winner, 1 point to each in a draw, or 0 points to the loser.
- After all games, their scores are `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` with `p1 <= p2 <= p3`.
- We need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened, or `-1` if the scores are inconsistent.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Score Validation**:
   - The program checks if the total points `(p1 + p2 + p3)` are even. If not, it prints `-1` because points from games must be in multiples of 2 (either 0, 1, or 2 points per game).
   - If the total points are even, it proceeds to determine the maximum number of draws.

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws**:
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, it prints `p1 + p2`. This is because if the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores, the maximum number of draws can be `p1 + p2` (considering that `p1` and `p2` could have drawn among themselves).
   - Otherwise, it calculates `low` and `high` as the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and the other scores.
   - It then iterates from `low` to `high` to find a valid number of draws that satisfies the conditions.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where no games were played (`0 0 0`) by printing `0`.
   - It also handles cases where the scores are inconsistent by printing `-1`.

### Detailed Analysis Using Annotations:

- **State of the program right before the function call**: Each test case contains three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order. The number of test cases `t` satisfies `1 ≤ t ≤ 500`.

- **After reading inputs and processing each test case**:
  - **Score Validation**: The program checks if `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0`. If true, it prints `-1`.
  - **If scores are valid**:
    - **Case 1**: `p3 >= p1 + p2`. The program prints `p1 + p2`.
    - **Case 2**: `p3 < p1 + p2`. The program calculates `low` and `high`:
      - `low = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`
      - `high = max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`
      - It then iterates from `low` to `high` to find a valid number of draws:
        - If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks the loop.
        - If no valid `cur` is found, it prints `p3`.

### Conclusion:
