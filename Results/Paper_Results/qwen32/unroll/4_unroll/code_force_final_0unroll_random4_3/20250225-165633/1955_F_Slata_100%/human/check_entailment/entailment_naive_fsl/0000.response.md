Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly meets the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game with a sequence of integers, each integer being 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.
- Eve removes one number after each game until the sequence is empty.
- Eve wants Bob to win as many times as possible.
- Determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

### Program Analysis:
The provided code is:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
```

### Breakdown:
- `a, b, c, d` represent the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s respectively.
- `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` counts the number of pairs for each number.
- `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if there is exactly one leftover of each number (1, 2, 3) after pairing, which would result in a XOR of 0.

### Correctness Check:
1. **Pairing Strategy**: The code correctly pairs each number, and each pair does not contribute to a non-zero XOR.
2. **Leftovers**: The code correctly identifies when there is exactly one leftover of each 1, 2, and 3, which would result in a XOR of 0. This is a key part of ensuring Bob wins.
3. **Edge Cases**:
    - **All numbers are paired**: In this case, the XOR is 0, and Bob wins.
    - **One leftover of each 1, 2, and 3**: The XOR is 0, and Bob wins.
    - **Other single leftovers**: The XOR is non-zero, and Alice wins.

### Testing with Example Cases:
1. **Input**: `1 1 1 0`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: One leftover of each 1, 2, and 3 is not possible, so Bob wins once when all numbers are paired.
2. **Input**: `1 0 1 2`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Bob wins once when one 1 and one 3 are removed, leaving 2 and 4, which XOR to 0.
3. **Input**: `2 2 2 0`
   - Output: `3`
   - Explanation: Bob wins three times by removing pairs optimally.
4. **Input**: `3 3 2 0`
   - Output: `3`
   - Explanation: Bob wins three times by removing pairs optimally.
5. **Input**: `0 9 9 9`
   - Output: `12`
   - Explanation: Bob wins twelve times by removing pairs optimally.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to handle all the described cases correctly. It correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by pairing numbers and considering the optimal removal strategy.

Correctness: **True**.
