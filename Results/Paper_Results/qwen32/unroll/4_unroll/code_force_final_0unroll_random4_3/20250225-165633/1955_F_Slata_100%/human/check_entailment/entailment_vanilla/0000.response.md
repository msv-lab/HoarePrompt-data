Let's analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally from the sequence. Bob wins when the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Bitwise XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of a number with itself is 0 (e.g., 1 XOR 1 = 0, 2 XOR 2 = 0).
   - XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself (e.g., 1 XOR 0 = 1).
   - XOR is commutative and associative.

2. **Winning Condition**:
   - Bob wins if the XOR of all remaining numbers is 0.
   - This can happen if pairs of the same number are removed, leaving an even count of each number or exactly three numbers with odd counts (since 1 XOR 1 XOR 1 = 1, which is non-zero, but 1 XOR 1 XOR 1 XOR 1 = 0).

3. **Eve's Optimal Strategy**:
   - Eve should aim to remove numbers such that Bob wins as many times as possible.
   - This means creating situations where the XOR of the remaining numbers is 0.

#### Strategy:
- For each type of number (1, 2, 3, 4), the optimal strategy is to remove numbers in pairs.
- After removing pairs, if there are exactly three numbers with odd counts, Bob can win once more.

### Code Analysis

Let's break down the code provided:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
```

1. **Loop through Test Cases**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and iterates over each one.

2. **Read Input**:
   - For each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.

3. **Calculate Bob's Wins**:
   - `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2`: This calculates the number of pairs that can be removed for each type of number, contributing to Bob's wins.
   - `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`: This checks if there are exactly three numbers with odd counts. If true, it adds one more win for Bob.

### Conclusion

The code correctly implements the strategy described above:
- It counts the number of pairs that can be removed for each type of number.
- It checks if there are exactly three numbers with odd counts to account for one more win.

Therefore, the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**
