You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program:

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        i = 0
        j = 0
        while i <= n - 1:
            p = l[i]
            q = l[p - 1]
            if q == i + 1:
                print(2)
                j = 1
                break
            i += 1
        if j == 0:
            print(3)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        i = 0
        
        j = 0
        
        while i <= n - 1:
            p = l[i]
            q = l[p - 1]
            if q == i + 1:
                print(2)
                j = 1
                break
            i += 1
        
        if j == 0:
            print(3)
        
    #State: i is the final index checked in the last test case, and j is 0 or 1 depending on whether a valid index was found in the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it checks a list of integers to determine if there exists an index `i` such that the value at `p[p[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1`. If such an index is found, it outputs `2`; otherwise, it outputs `3`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
Monocarp wants to invite at least 2 friends to his party. Each friend `i` has a best friend `p_i`, and for each friend to attend, both the friend and their best friend must receive an invitation. We need to find the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends attend.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program seems to be attempting to find a pair of friends who are best friends with each other and, if found, prints `2` as the answer. If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

#### Key Points:
1. **Loop Through Friends**: The program iterates through each friend `i` and checks if `i` and `p_i` (friend `i`'s best friend) are best friends with each other, i.e., if `p_i`'s best friend is `i`.
2. **Condition Check**: If such a pair is found (`q == i + 1` where `q` is the best friend of `p_i`), the program prints `2` and exits the loop.
3. **Fallback Answer**: If no such pair is found after checking all friends, the program prints `3`.

### Issues:
- **Assumption of Answer**: The program assumes that if there is a pair of friends who are best friends with each other, inviting just those two will ensure that at least two friends attend. This is correct.
- **Fallback Answer**: However, the assumption that if no such pair is found, the answer is `3` is incorrect. It's possible that the minimum number of invitations needed could be more than `3` in certain configurations.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
6
2 3 4 5 6 1
```
In this configuration, no two friends are best friends with each other. However, the program will print `3` as the answer, which is incorrect. The correct answer would be `4` because we need to invite friends `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4` to ensure that friends `2` and `3` attend.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it does not correctly compute the minimum number of invitations when no pair of friends are best friends with each other.

**Correctness: False**
