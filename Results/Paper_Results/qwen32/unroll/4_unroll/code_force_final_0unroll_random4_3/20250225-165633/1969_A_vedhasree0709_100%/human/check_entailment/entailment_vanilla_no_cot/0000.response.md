Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not always correctly determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. The program only checks for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends (i.e., a mutual best friend relationship) and assumes that if such a pair exists, only 2 invitations are needed. However, it does not account for cases where more than 2 friends need to be invited to ensure at least 2 come to the party.

For example, consider the following test case:

```
4
4
2 3 4 1
4
2 3 1 4
4
3 4 2 1
4
4 3 2 1
```

The correct output should be `3` for each of these test cases, as no pair of mutual best friends exists, and at least 3 friends need to be invited to ensure that at least 2 come to the party. However, the provided program would output `2` for the first case and `3` for the others, which is incorrect for the first case.

The program needs to be modified to correctly handle all cases, including those where no mutual best friend pairs exist.
