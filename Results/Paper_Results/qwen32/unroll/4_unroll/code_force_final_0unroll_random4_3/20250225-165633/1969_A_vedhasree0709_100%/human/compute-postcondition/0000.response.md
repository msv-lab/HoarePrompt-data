In the provided code snippet, the for loop is iterating over a range determined by the integer `t` which is obtained from the `input()`. The loop will execute `t` times. The variables `n` and `p` are mentioned in the context of each test case, but they are not directly part of the loop head. Therefore, we can only adjust the state related to `t` to ensure the loop executes.

Given that `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 5000`, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The current state already satisfies this condition as `t` is at least 1 and at most 5000. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t`.

The variables `n` and `p` are part of the test case processing inside the loop, not the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted in the state before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000**
