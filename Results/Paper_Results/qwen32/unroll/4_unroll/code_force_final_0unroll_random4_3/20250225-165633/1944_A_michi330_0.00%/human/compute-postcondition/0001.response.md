To ensure that the `for` loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i`, `t`, and the range parameters `0`, `t`, and `1`. According to the loop statement `for i in range(0, t, 1):`, the loop will execute if `t` is greater than `0`. The variable `i` is initialized to `0` and will increment by `1` in each iteration until it reaches `t`.

Given the problem statement, `t` is the number of test cases and it is assigned the value from `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least `1` because the range function will not generate any values if `t` is `0`.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once for each test case.
