Output State: **The function receives an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the function receives two integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2) where `n` is the number of islands and `k` is the maximum number of bridges Dominater can destroy. `t` is assigned the value `int(input())`.**

In simpler terms, the variable `t` is now assigned the integer value obtained from the input, representing the number of test cases. The conditions and constraints for `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
