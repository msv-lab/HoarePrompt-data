The code snippet provided only initializes a variable `c` to 0. None of the other variables (`a`, `x`, `ind`) are affected by this statement. Therefore, the values of `a`, `x`, and `ind` remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where the first element `t` represents the number of test cases. Each test case is represented by two parts: the first part is a list containing two integers `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ n), representing the number of cows and the index of the cow you own, respectively. The second part is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with all `a_i`'s being pairwise different. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `x` is assigned the value of `a[k]`, which is the rating of the `(k+1)`-th cow in 1-based indexing. `ind` is an empty list. `c` is 0.**
