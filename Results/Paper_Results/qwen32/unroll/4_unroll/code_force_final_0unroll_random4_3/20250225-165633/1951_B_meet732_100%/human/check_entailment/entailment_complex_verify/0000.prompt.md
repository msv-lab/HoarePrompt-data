You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a list `a` that contains multiple test cases. Each test case includes the number of cows `n`, the index `k` of the cow you own, and a list of Cowdeforces ratings for the cows. The function determines and returns a value based on the ratings and indices of the cows. Specifically, it identifies up to two cows with ratings higher than the cow at index `k` and calculates a value that represents a certain relationship between the indices of these cows and the index `k`. The return value depends on the number and positions of these cows with higher ratings.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number of wins for cow k by either doing nothing or swapping once optimally. There are several issues with the code.

1. **Function `func_1` is not defined properly**: The function `func_1` is called in the main loop but is not defined correctly. The variable `n` is used inside `func_1` but is not passed as an argument to the function.

2. **Incorrect logic for determining wins**: The logic inside `func_1` is incorrect. It tries to find the first two cows with ratings higher than cow k's rating and then makes decisions based on their positions. However, this does not correctly simulate the tournament process and does not account for the possibility of swapping cow k with another cow to maximize wins.

3. **Incorrect handling of edge cases**: The code does not handle all edge cases, such as when cow k is already the strongest cow or when swapping cow k with another cow could lead to more wins than not swapping.

To illustrate the issues, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5 2
10 20 15 25 30
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- Initially, cow 2 (with rating 20) plays against cow 1 (with rating 10) and wins.
- Then cow 2 plays against cow 3 (with rating 15) and wins.
- Finally, cow 2 plays against cow 4 (with rating 25) and loses.
- Total wins for cow 2: 2.

However, if cow 2 swaps with cow 5 (with rating 30) before the tournament starts, the sequence of wins would be:
- Cow 5 (with rating 30) plays against cow 1 (with rating 10) and wins.
- Cow 5 plays against cow 3 (with rating 15) and wins.
- Cow 5 plays against cow 4 (with rating 25) and wins.
- Total wins for cow 5 (originally cow 2): 3.

The provided code does not account for this optimal swap scenario, and thus it would not produce the correct output for this test case.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
