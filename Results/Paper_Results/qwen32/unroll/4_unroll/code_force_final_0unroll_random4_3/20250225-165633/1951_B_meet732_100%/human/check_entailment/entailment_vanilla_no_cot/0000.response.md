Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve. Let's break down the issues:

1. The function `func_1` does not account for the possibility of swapping the cow's position to optimize the number of wins.
2. The function `func_1` incorrectly calculates the number of wins in several scenarios:
   - It does not handle the case where the cow's position is not optimal and swapping would yield more wins.
   - The logic for determining the number of wins is flawed, especially when there are more than two cows with higher ratings.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def max_wins(n, k, ratings):
    k -= 1  # Convert to 0-based index
    original_wins = 0
    
    # Calculate the number of wins if no swap is made
    current_max = ratings[k]
    for i in range(k + 1, n):
        if ratings[i] > current_max:
            break
        original_wins += 1
        current_max = ratings[i]
    
    # Try to find the best swap position
    max_wins = original_wins
    for i in range(n):
        if i == k:
            continue
        
        # Swap ratings[k] and ratings[i]
        ratings[k], ratings[i] = ratings[i], ratings[k]
        
        # Calculate the number of wins with this swap
        current_max = ratings[k]
        wins = 0
        if i == 0:
            wins += 1
            current_max = max(current_max, ratings[1])
            for j in range(2, n):
                if ratings[j] > current_max:
                    break
                wins += 1
                current_max = ratings[j]
        else:
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]:
                wins += 1
                current_max = max(current_max, ratings[i - 1])
                for j in range(i + 1, n):
                    if ratings[j] > current_max:
                        break
                    wins += 1
                    current_max = ratings[j]
        
        # Restore the original ratings
        ratings[k], ratings[i] = ratings[i], ratings[k]
        
        max_wins = max(max_wins, wins)
    
    return max_wins

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    ratings = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(max_wins(n, k, ratings))
```

This corrected version calculates the number of wins for the cow in its original position and then tries every possible swap to find the maximum number of wins. It ensures that the cow's position is optimized to achieve the highest possible number of wins.
