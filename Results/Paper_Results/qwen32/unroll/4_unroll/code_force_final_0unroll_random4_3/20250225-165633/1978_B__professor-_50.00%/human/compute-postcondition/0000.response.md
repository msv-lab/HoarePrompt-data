The code provided reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. This affects the variable `t` but does not change the values of `n`, `a`, or `b` as they are not mentioned in the given code snippet. The output state should reflect the updated value of `t` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n`, `a`, and `b` are each an integer where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.**
