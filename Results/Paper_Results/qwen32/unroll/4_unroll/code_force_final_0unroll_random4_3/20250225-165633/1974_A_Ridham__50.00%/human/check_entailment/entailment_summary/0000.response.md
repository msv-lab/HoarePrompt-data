Let's analyze the provided program to see if it correctly solves the problem of determining the minimum number of screens required to place the application icons.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Grid Size**: 5x3 grid (15 cells per screen).
2. **Icons**:
   - 1x1 icons (occupy 1 cell each).
   - 2x2 icons (occupy 4 cells each).
3. **Objective**: Place all icons on the minimum number of screens.

### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 icons (`x`) and 2x2 icons (`y`).
- It calculates the total space required by the 2x2 icons (`space_y = y * 4`).
- It calculates the total space required by the 1x1 icons (`space_x = x * 1`).
- It then determines the number of screens required to place the 2x2 icons (`screen_require_for_y`):
  - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y = y // 2`.
  - If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1`.
- It calculates the remaining cells on these screens after placing the 2x2 icons (`remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`).
- If the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`space_x <= remaining_cells`), it appends `screen_require_for_y` to the result.
- Otherwise, it calculates the extra space required and the number of additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons (`extra_screen`), then appends the total screens required (`extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`) to the result.
- Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Handling of 2x2 Icons**: The program correctly calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons.
2. **Remaining Cells Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons.
3. **Handling of 1x1 Icons**: The program correctly calculates the number of additional screens required for 1x1 icons if the remaining cells are insufficient.

### Correctness Verification:
Let's verify the program against the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1**: `x = 1`, `y = 1`
   - `space_y = 4`, `space_x = 1`
   - `screen_require_for_y = 1`
   - `remaining_cells = 15 - 4 = 11`
   - Since `1 <= 11`, only 1 screen is required.
   - **Correct**.

2. **Test Case 2**: `x = 7`, `y = 2`
   - `space_y = 8`, `space_x = 7`
   - `screen_require_for_y = 1`
   - `remaining_cells = 15 - 8 = 7`
   - Since `7 <= 7`, only 1 screen is required.
   - **Correct**.

3. **Test Case 3**: `x = 12`, `y = 4`
   - `space_y = 16`, `space_x = 12`
   - `screen_require_for_y = 2`
   - `remaining_cells = 30 - 16 = 14`
   - Since `12 <= 14`, only 2 screens are required.
   - **Correct**.

4. **Test Case 11**: `x = 0`, `y = 9`
   - `space_y = 36`, `space_x = 0`
   - `screen_require_for_y = 5`
   - `remaining_cells = 75 - 36 = 39`
   - Since `0 <= 39`, only 5 screens are required.
   - **Correct**.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the placement of both 1x1 and 2x2 icons and calculates the minimum number of screens required for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
