The code provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, and for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` each ranging from 0 to 99. However, the code snippet provided does not make use of `t`, `x`, or `y`; it only reads a new integer input and assigns it to `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers x and y such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` is an input integer.**
