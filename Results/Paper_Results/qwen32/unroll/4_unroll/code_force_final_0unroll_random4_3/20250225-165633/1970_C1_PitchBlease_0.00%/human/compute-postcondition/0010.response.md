Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree, a list of tuples `edges` where each tuple (u, v) represents an edge between nodes u and v, and an integer `start` representing the starting node where a stone is initially placed. The function returns 'Ron' if a certain condition is met, and 'Hermione' otherwise.**
