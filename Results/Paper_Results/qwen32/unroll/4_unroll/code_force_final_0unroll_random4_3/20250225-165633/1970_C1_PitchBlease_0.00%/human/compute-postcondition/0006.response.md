Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `edges` is a list of tuples representing edges between nodes, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `tree` is a `defaultdict` with lists as default values representing adjacency lists for each node, `leaves` is a list of nodes that have exactly one connection in the tree, `dist1` is the shortest distance from `start` to `leaves[0]`, `dist2` is the shortest distance from `start` to `leaves[1]`. At least one of `dist1` or `dist2` is even.**
