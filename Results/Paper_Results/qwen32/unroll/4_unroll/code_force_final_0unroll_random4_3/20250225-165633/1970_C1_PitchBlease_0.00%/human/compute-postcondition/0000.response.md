The code snippet initializes a `deque` with a single tuple containing the `start` node and the distance `0`. This means the `queue` is now a deque with the initial element as `(start, 0)`. The values of `start`, `target`, and `tree` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n; `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree with n nodes; `queue` is a deque with the initial element `(start, 0)`.**
