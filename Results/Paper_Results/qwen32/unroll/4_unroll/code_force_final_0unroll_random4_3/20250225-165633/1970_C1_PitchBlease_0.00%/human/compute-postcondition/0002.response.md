The only condition in the loop head is the `queue`. The loop will execute as long as `queue` is not empty. According to the state provided, `queue` is already initialized with the element `(start, 0)`, which means it is not empty.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n; `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree with n nodes; `queue` is a deque with the initial element `(start, 0)`; `visited` is a set containing the element `start`.**
