t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a description of a test case. Each test case description is a tuple (n, f, k, a), where n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, f and k are integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for each a_i in a.
