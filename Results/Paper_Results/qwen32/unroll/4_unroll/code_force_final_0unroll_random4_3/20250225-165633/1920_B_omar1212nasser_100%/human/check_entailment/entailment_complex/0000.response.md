### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and compare it to the problem requirements.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a` of `n` integers.
   - The list `a` is sorted in ascending order.

2. **Logic to Compute the Result:**
   - The function `func_2` is called with `k`, `x`, and the sorted list `a`.
   - Inside `func_2`, the initial sum of the array is computed (`s`), and the sum of the last `x` elements (which Bob can potentially negate) is computed (`s2`).
   - The function then iterates over the number of elements Alice can remove (`removals`), updating the sums `s` and `s2` accordingly.
   - The function computes a list of possible sums (`pos`) based on the different numbers of elements Alice can remove.
   - The function returns the maximum value from this list, which represents the optimal sum after both players have played optimally.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the sum, so she should remove the smallest elements (since the array is sorted).
   - Bob wants to minimize the sum, so he should negate the largest possible elements. Since the array is sorted, the largest elements are at the end.
   - The function correctly computes the sum after Alice removes `i` elements and Bob negates the largest possible elements, taking into account the elements removed by Alice.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles cases where `k` or `x` is equal to `n` (Alice removes all elements or Bob negates all elements).
   - The function also handles cases where `k` or `x` is 1, ensuring that only one element is removed or negated, respectively.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all given constraints and edge cases, and the output matches the expected results for the provided examples.
