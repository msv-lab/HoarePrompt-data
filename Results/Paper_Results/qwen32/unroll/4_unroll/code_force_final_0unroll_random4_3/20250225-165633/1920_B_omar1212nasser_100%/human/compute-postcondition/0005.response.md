To determine the output state after the loop executes all its iterations, let's analyze the loop step by step:

### Initial State Recap:
- `removals`: A non-negative integer indicating how many elements to remove from the end of `elements`.
- `negatives`: A non-negative integer indicating how many elements from the end of `elements` are considered negative.
- `elements`: A list of integers.
- `pos`: A list initialized with one element, `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`.
- `s`: The sum of all integers in `elements`.
- `s2`: The sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = removals`. In each iteration:
1. `s` is decreased by `elements[-i]`.
2. `s2` is decreased by `elements[-i]`.
3. If `negatives + i` is within the bounds of `elements`, `s2` is increased by `elements[-(negatives + i)]`.
4. `pos` appends a new value calculated as `s - 2 * s2`.

### Iteration Details:
- **Iteration 1 (`i = 1`)**:
  - `s` becomes `s - elements[-1]`.
  - `s2` becomes `s2 - elements[-1]`.
  - If `negatives + 1` is valid, `s2` becomes `s2 + elements[-(negatives + 1)]`.
  - `pos` appends `s - 2 * s2`.

- **Iteration 2 (`i = 2`)**:
  - `s` becomes `s - elements[-2]`.
  - `s2` becomes `s2 - elements[-2]`.
  - If `negatives + 2` is valid, `s2` becomes `s2 + elements[-(negatives + 2)]`.
  - `pos` appends `s - 2 * s2`.

- **...**
- **Iteration `removals` (`i = removals`)**:
  - `s` becomes `s - elements[-removals]`.
  - `s2` becomes `s2 - elements[-removals]`.
  - If `negatives + removals` is valid, `s2` becomes `s2 + elements[-(negatives + removals)]`.
  - `pos` appends `s - 2 * s2`.

### Final Output State:
- `removals`: Remains unchanged.
- `negatives`: Remains unchanged.
- `elements`: Remains unchanged.
- `s`: Decreased by the sum of the last `removals` elements of `elements`.
- `s2`: Adjusted based on the last `removals` elements and the `negatives` elements.
- `pos`: Contains the initial value and `removals` additional values calculated as `s - 2 * s2` in each iteration.

### Output State in Required Format:
Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`) and 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`). `elements` is a list of integers. `pos` is a list containing `removals + 1` elements, starting with `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` and followed by values calculated as `s - 2 * s2` after each iteration of the loop. `s` is the sum of the integers in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements. `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` adjusted by the last `removals` elements.**
