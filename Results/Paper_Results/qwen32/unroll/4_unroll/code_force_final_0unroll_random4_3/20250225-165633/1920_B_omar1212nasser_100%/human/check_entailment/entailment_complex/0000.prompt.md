Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have an array a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n . The
game consists of two steps:

  * First, Alice will remove at most k elements from the array. 
  * Second, Bob will multiply at most x elements of the array by -1 . 

Alice wants to maximize the sum of elements of the array while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both
players play optimally.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and x (1 \leq
n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq x,k \leq n ) — the number of elements in the
array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove,
and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1
to.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 1000 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of elements of the array
after the game if both players play optimally.

Output

    0
    2
    0
    3
    -5
    -9
    0
    -1
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove the only element of
the array. Then, the sum of elements of the array is 0 after the game is over.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Alice to not remove any elements.
Bob will then multiply 4 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
3+1+2-4=2 .

In the fifth test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove 9, 9 . Bob will then
multiply 5, 5, 3 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
-5-5-3+3+3+2=-5 .

# Annotated Functions:
func_1()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, k, and x are integers such that 1 <= n, k, x <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 1000.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        product = func_2(k, x, a)
        
        print(product)
        
    #State: `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are the values read and processed in the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, `x`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it sorts the list `a` and computes a product using the values of `k`, `x`, and the sorted list `a`. The computed product is then printed.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: removals and negatives are non-negative integers such that 0 <= removals <= len(elements) and 0 <= negatives <= len(elements). elements is a list of integers.
def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    pos = []
    s = sum(elements)
    pos.append(s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:]))
    s2 = sum(elements[-negatives:])
    for i in range(1, removals + 1):
        s -= elements[-i]
        
        s2 -= elements[-i]
        
        if negatives + i <= len(elements):
            s2 += elements[-(negatives + i)]
        
        pos.append(s - 2 * s2)
        
    #State: `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`) and 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`). `elements` is a list of integers. `pos` is a list containing `removals + 1` elements, starting with `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` and followed by values calculated as `s - 2 * s2` after each iteration of the loop. `s` is the sum of the integers in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements. `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` adjusted by the last `removals` elements.
    return max(pos)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list `pos`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the maximum value from a list of computed sums based on the input list of integers (`elements`), the number of elements to remove from the end (`removals`), and the number of elements to consider as negative (`negatives`).
