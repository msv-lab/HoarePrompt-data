The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `pos`. The initial state of `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements` remains unchanged as they are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`) and 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`). `elements` is a list of integers. `pos` is an empty list.**
