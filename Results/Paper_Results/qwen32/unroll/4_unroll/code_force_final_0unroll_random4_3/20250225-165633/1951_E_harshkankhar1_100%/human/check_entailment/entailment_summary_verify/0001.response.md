### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's analyze the program in detail to confirm these issues and ensure the assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1(s) -> bool`:
This function correctly checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse. It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.

#### Function `func_2()`:
This function reads a string `s` from the input and attempts to determine if it can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. Here are the key points of analysis:

1. **Immediate Check for Non-Palindrome**:
   - If the entire string `s` is not a palindrome, the function correctly prints "YES", the number of parts as `1`, and the string `s` itself as the partition.
   - This part of the logic is correct.

2. **Handling Palindromic Strings**:
   - The function then searches for the first character that differs from the first character of the string.
   - If no such character is found (i.e., the string consists of the same character repeated), it correctly prints "NO".
   - This part of the logic is also correct.

3. **Partitioning Logic for Palindromic Strings**:
   - If a differing character is found at index `x`, the function checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome.
   - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", the number of parts as `2`, and the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
   - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, the function checks if `x` is `1` or `n // 2`. If so, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES", the number of parts as `2`, and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.

   **Issues**:
   - The logic for partitioning palindromic strings is flawed. For example, for a string like "abccba", the function might fail to find a valid partition.
   - The function does not consider other possible partitions that could make all substrings non-palindromic. For instance, "abccba" could be partitioned into "abc" and "cba", both of which are not palindromes.
   - The function does not handle cases where more than two partitions are needed.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The function prints an extra space in the partitioned substrings, which is incorrect according to the problem's output format requirements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identifies the issues with the program. The program fails to handle all cases of palindromic strings and does not consider multiple partitions when necessary. Additionally, it does not adhere to the required output format.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
