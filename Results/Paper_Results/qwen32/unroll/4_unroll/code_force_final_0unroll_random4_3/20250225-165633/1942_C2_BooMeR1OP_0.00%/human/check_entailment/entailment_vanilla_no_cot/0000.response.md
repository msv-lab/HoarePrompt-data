Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum number of triangular pieces that can be formed by adding up to `y` more vertices to the already chosen `x` vertices in a regular polygon with `n` sides.

Here are the key issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Triangle Counting Logic**:
   - The program assumes that for each vertex, if the next vertex in the sequence is chosen and the one after that is not, it can form a triangle. This is not always the case, especially when considering the circular nature of the polygon and the non-intersecting constraint.

2. **Incorrect Gap Handling**:
   - The program calculates gaps between consecutive chosen vertices and tries to fill these gaps with additional vertices to form triangles. However, it does not correctly account for the fact that adding a vertex can potentially close more than one gap and form multiple triangles.
   - The program also incorrectly adds the entire gap to the answer when it can only add a certain number of triangles based on the number of additional vertices available (`y`).

3. **Non-Optimal Vertex Placement**:
   - The program does not consider the optimal placement of the additional vertices to maximize the number of triangles. It simply fills gaps with pairs of vertices, which may not always yield the maximum number of triangles.

4. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the polygon is small or where the additional vertices are limited.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as:
- Using dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to determine the optimal placement of additional vertices.
- Ensuring that the added vertices do not lead to intersecting diagonals.
- Correctly counting the number of triangles formed by the chosen vertices and the additional vertices.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.
