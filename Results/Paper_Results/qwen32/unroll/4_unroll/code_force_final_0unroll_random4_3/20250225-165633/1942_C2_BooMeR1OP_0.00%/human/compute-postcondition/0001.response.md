The code snippet provided reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers. This list is assigned to the variable `a`. Given the initial state and the code, the value of `a` will be updated to reflect the integers provided in the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 <= y <= n - x. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned specific values from the input. `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
