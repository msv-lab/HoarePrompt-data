To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze its logic against the problem description.

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move. After `n` moves, we need to determine if it's possible for the tower to have exactly `m` cubes.

The key points to consider are:
1. If `n` (number of moves) is less than `m` (number of cubes), it's impossible to have `m` cubes because he can only add one cube per move.
2. If `n` is equal to `m`, it's possible if all moves are additions.
3. If `n` is greater than `m`, it's possible if the difference `n - m` is even. This is because for each pair of moves (one addition and one removal), the net effect is zero cubes. If `n - m` is even, all extra moves can be paired up to result in exactly `m` cubes.

Let's review the provided program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)  # This line does nothing useful
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:  # This line has a logical error
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

There are a couple of issues:
1. The line `q = (b, c)` does not affect the logic and can be removed.
2. The condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2` is incorrect. Here, `a` is the number of test cases, not the number of moves. The correct condition should be `elif (b - c) % 2 == 0`.

The corrected condition should check if the difference `b - c` is even and `b` is greater than or equal to `c`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

Given these points, the original program is incorrect due to the logical error in the condition.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **False**
