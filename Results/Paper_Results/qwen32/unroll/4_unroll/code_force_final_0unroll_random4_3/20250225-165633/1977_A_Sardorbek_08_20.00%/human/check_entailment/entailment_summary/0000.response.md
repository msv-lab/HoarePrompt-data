Reasoning:
The provided program has a logical error in the condition checking for the parity of `a` and `b`. According to the problem statement, we need to determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves. The key observation is that the difference between the number of moves `n` and the final number of cubes `m` must be even because each move either adds or removes one cube.

The correct condition should check if `n - m` is even, not `a % 2 == b % 2`. Here's the breakdown of the correct logic:
1. If `n == m`, it's possible to end up with `m` cubes, so print 'YES'.
2. If `n < m`, it's not possible to end up with more cubes than the number of moves, so print 'NO'.
3. If `n > m` and `n - m` is even, it's possible to end up with `m` cubes by adding and removing cubes appropriately, so print 'YES'.
4. Otherwise, print 'NO'.

The current program incorrectly uses `a % 2 == b % 2` which is unrelated to the problem logic.

Correctness: **False**
