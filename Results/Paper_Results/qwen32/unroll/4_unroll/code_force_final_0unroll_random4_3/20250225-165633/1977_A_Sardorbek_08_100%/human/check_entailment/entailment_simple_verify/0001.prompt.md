You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers n and m such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers n and m such that 1 <= n, m <= 100; a is an input integer. The loop has printed a series of 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' based on the comparisons of b and c for each of the a iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove one cube per move. Therefore, the number of cubes in the tower after `n` moves can be any integer value between `-n` and `n` (inclusive), but since we cannot have a negative number of cubes, the actual range is from `0` to `n`.

For Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves:
1. If `m > n`, it's impossible because the maximum number of cubes he can have is `n`. So, the answer should be "No".
2. If `m == n`, it's possible if he adds one cube each time. So, the answer should be "Yes".
3. If `m < n`, it's possible if the difference `n - m` is even. This is because each pair of moves (one addition and one removal) does not change the number of cubes, and he can perform `n - m` additions or removals to reach `m` cubes. So, the answer should be "Yes" if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`, otherwise "No".

Now, let's examine the provided program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

- The program correctly handles the case when `b == c` by printing "YES".
- However, the condition `elif b < c` is incorrect. According to the problem, if `b < c`, it should print "NO" only if `c > b` (which is already covered in the previous condition). Instead, the program incorrectly prints "NO" whenever `b < c`, which is not correct.
- The condition `elif b % 2 == c % 2` is intended to check if `b - c` is even, but it does not correctly handle the scenario where `b > c`. It should check if `b - c` is even, which is equivalent to checking if `(b - c) % 2 == 0` or `(b % 2) == (c % 2)`. However, this condition alone is not sufficient because it does not account for the possibility where `b < c`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the cases where `b < c` and does not properly check the parity condition for `b > c`.
