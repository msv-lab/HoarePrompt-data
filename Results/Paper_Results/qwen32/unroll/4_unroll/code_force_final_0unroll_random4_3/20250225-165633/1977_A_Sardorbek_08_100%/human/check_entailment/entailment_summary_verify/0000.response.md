### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the provided program's logic for handling cases where `b > c`. The original program checks if `b % 2 == c % 2` to determine if it's possible to achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, which is not sufficient.

To elaborate:
- If `b == c`, the program correctly prints 'YES'.
- If `b < c`, the program correctly prints 'NO' because it's impossible to end up with more cubes than the number of moves.
- If `b > c`, the correct condition to check is whether `(b - c) % 2 == 0`. This is because the difference `b - c` must be achievable by a series of adding and removing cubes in pairs. If `b - c` is even, it means that Nikita can perform a sequence of moves that results in exactly `m` cubes.

The counterexample given in the original assessment (`1 5 1`) clearly demonstrates the flaw in the original program. The program outputs 'No' because `5 % 2 != 1 % 2`, but it should output 'Yes' because `(5 - 1) % 2 == 0`.

The corrected version of the program, as suggested in the original assessment, correctly handles all cases:
- If `b == c`, print 'YES'.
- If `b < c`, print 'NO'.
- If `b >= c` and `(b - c) % 2 == 0`, print 'YES'.
- Otherwise, print 'NO'.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The original program is incorrect and needs to be modified as per the corrected version to handle all cases correctly.
