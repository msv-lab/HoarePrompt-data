Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for determining if it is possible for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Specifically, the logic for handling cases where `b > c` is flawed.

Let's examine the problematic logic:
- If `b == c`, the program correctly prints 'YES'.
- If `b < c`, the program correctly prints 'NO' because it's impossible to end up with more cubes than the number of moves.
- If `b > c`, the program checks if `b % 2 == c % 2` and prints 'Yes' if true, otherwise prints 'No'.

The condition `b % 2 == c % 2` is incorrect because it doesn't account for all scenarios where `b > c` and `m` cubes can still be achieved. For example, if `b > c` and `b - c` is even, it means that the difference in the number of moves can be exactly balanced by adding and removing cubes in pairs, which is valid.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:
- Input: `1 5 1`
- Expected Output: `Yes` (Nikita can add 1 cube, remove 4 cubes, and add 1 cube again, resulting in 1 cube).
- Actual Output: `No` (because `5 % 2 != 1 % 2`).

The correct logic should be:
- If `b == c`, print 'YES'.
- If `b < c`, print 'NO'.
- If `b >= c` and `(b - c) % 2 == 0`, print 'YES' (because the difference can be achieved by a series of adding and removing cubes).
- Otherwise, print 'NO'.

Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```
This corrected version handles all cases as per the problem description.
