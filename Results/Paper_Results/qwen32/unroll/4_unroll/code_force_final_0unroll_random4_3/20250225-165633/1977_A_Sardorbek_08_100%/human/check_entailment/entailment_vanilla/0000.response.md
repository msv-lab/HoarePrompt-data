Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis
Nikita can perform two types of operations on the tower:
1. Add exactly 1 cube.
2. Remove exactly 1 cube.

The initial number of cubes in the tower is 0. After `n` moves, we need to determine if it's possible for the tower to have exactly `m` cubes.

### Key Observations
1. **Parity (Even/Odd) Matters:**
   - If `n` is even, the net effect of the operations can only result in an even number of cubes because adding or removing one cube alternates the parity.
   - If `n` is odd, the net effect can result in either an even or an odd number of cubes.

2. **Minimum and Maximum Possible Cubes:**
   - The minimum number of cubes after `n` moves is `0` (if all operations are removals).
   - The maximum number of cubes after `n` moves is `n` (if all operations are additions).

3. **Feasibility Conditions:**
   - If `m > n`, it's impossible because the maximum number of cubes is `n`.
   - If `m < 0`, it's impossible because the minimum number of cubes is `0`.
   - If `m` is within the range `[0, n]` and the parity of `m` matches the parity of `n` (both even or both odd), it's possible.

### Program Analysis
Let's evaluate the given program against the problem requirements:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)  # This line is unnecessary and does nothing useful
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

1. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates through each one.

2. **Checking Conditions:**
   - **`if b == c:`** This condition checks if the number of moves equals the number of cubes. If true, it prints "YES". This is correct because if `b == c`, we can simply add `c` cubes in `c` moves.
   - **`elif b < c:`** This condition checks if the number of moves is less than the number of cubes. If true, it prints "NO". This is correct because if `b < c`, we cannot have more cubes than moves.
   - **`elif b % 2 == c % 2:`** This condition checks if the parity of `b` and `c` is the same. If true, it prints "Yes". This is correct because if `b` and `c` have the same parity, it's possible to end up with `c` cubes after `b` moves.
   - **`else:`** If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "No". This is correct because it covers the remaining cases where it's not possible to have `c` cubes after `b` moves.

3. **Output Case Sensitivity:**
   - The problem states that the output can be in any case (lowercase or uppercase). The program prints "YES" and "Yes", which are both acceptable.

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
