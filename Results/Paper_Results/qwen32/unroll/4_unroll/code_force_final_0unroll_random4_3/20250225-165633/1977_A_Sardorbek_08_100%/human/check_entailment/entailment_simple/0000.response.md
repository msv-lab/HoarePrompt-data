Reasoning:
The program is supposed to determine if it is possible to end up with a tower of exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove exactly one cube. The key observation here is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of moves `n` and the number of cubes `m` will determine the possibility of achieving the desired configuration. Specifically, it is only possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves if:
1. `m` is less than or equal to `n` (since you cannot have more cubes than the number of moves).
2. The parity of `n` and `m` must be the same (both odd or both even). This is because each move changes the parity of the number of cubes, so after an even number of moves, the parity of the number of cubes will be the same as the initial parity (which is 0, i.e., even), and after an odd number of moves, the parity will be different from the initial parity.

Let's analyze the given program against these conditions:
- If `b == c`, it prints 'YES'. This is correct because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, it is possible to build the tower by adding one cube per move.
- If `b < c`, it prints 'NO'. This is correct because if the number of moves is less than the number of cubes, it is impossible to have more cubes than moves.
- If `b % 2 == c % 2`, it prints 'Yes'. This is correct because if the parity of `n` and `m` is the same, it is possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'No'. This is correct because if `b < c` or the parity of `n` and `m` is different, it is impossible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.

The only issue with the program is the inconsistency in the case of the output strings ('YES', 'NO', 'Yes', 'No'). However, the problem statement mentions that any case of the letters is accepted, so this does not affect the correctness of the logic.

Therefore, based on the logic implemented, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
