The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from a disk at index `i`. It updates the `visited` list to mark disks that are reachable from disk `i`, adds these disks to the `nodes` list, and updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists based on the radius and position conditions. The function modifies these lists in place but does not return any value.
