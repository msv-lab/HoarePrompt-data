The code snippet only assigns the value `False` to the variable `ok`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n`, `coef0` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `coef1` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `nodes` is an empty list, `ok` is `False`.**
