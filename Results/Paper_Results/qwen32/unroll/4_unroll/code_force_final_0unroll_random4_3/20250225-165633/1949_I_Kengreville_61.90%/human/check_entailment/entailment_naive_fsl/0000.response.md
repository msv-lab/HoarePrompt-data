Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description. Here are the main problems:

1. **Global Variables**: The `dfs` function uses variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` which are defined in the `func_1` function. However, these variables are not passed as parameters to `dfs`, and they are not declared as global within `dfs`. This will lead to a `NameError` because `dfs` cannot access these variables.

2. **DFS Logic**: The DFS logic is intended to check if there is a way to adjust the radii such that the sum of all radii strictly decreases while maintaining the tangency conditions. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the logic for adjusting the radii. The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to track the adjustments, but the logic for ensuring that the sum of radii decreases is not correctly implemented.

3. **Condition for Tangency**: The condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` checks if two disks are tangent. However, the logic for adjusting the radii based on this condition is not correctly implemented in the DFS function.

4. **Output Logic**: The `ok` variable is set to `True` if `c1 != 0` for any connected component of disks. This logic does not correctly determine whether it is possible to adjust the radii such that the sum of all radii strictly decreases.

Here is an example where the program does not work as expected:

**Input:**
```
2
0 0 1
2 0 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation:**
In this example, the two disks are tangent to each other. We can decrease the radius of both disks by 0.5, resulting in two disks with radius 0.5 that are still tangent to each other, and the sum of the radii decreases from 2 to 1.

However, the provided code will likely output `NO` for this input because the logic for adjusting the radii is not correctly implemented.

To fix the code, the DFS function needs to correctly handle the logic for adjusting the radii and ensuring that the sum of the radii strictly decreases. The current implementation does not achieve this correctly.
