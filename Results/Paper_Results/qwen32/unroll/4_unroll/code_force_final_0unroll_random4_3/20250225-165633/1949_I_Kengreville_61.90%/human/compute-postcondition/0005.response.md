Postcondition: **`i` is an integer representing the index of a disk, such that 0 <= i < n. `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers where `x[i]` and `y[i]` represent the integer coordinates of the center of the i-th disk, and `r[i]` represents the radius of the i-th disk. If `visited[i]` is `False`, then `visited[j]` is `True` for disks `j` that are reachable from disk `i` through the condition satisfied in the loop, and `False` otherwise. `nodes` includes `i` and possibly other disks that were visited during the DFS traversal. `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` are updated for disks `j` that meet the condition in the loop, with `coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]`. If `visited[i]` is `True`, then no changes are made to `visited`, `nodes`, `coef0`, or `coef1`. `n` is the total number of disks.**
