### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations provided to determine its correctness in solving the problem.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if we can change the radii of disks such that:
  1. Disks that were tangent remain tangent.
  2. No two disks overlap.
  3. The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

#### Program Analysis:
The program uses a Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore the graph of tangent disks. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads `n`, the number of disks.
   - It then reads the coordinates `(x, y)` and radius `r` for each disk.

2. **DFS Initialization:**
   - `visited`: A list to keep track of which disks have been visited.
   - `coef0` and `coef1`: Coefficients used to represent the relationship between the radii of tangent disks.
   - `nodes`: A list to keep track of nodes (disks) in the current connected component of tangent disks.

3. **DFS Execution:**
   - For each disk `i` that hasn't been visited:
     - It initializes the coefficients `coef0[i]` and `coef1[i]`.
     - It starts a DFS from this disk.
     - After the DFS, it sums up the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` for all disks in the connected component.
     - If the sum of `coef1` is not zero, it sets `ok` to `True`.

4. **Output:**
   - If `ok` is `True`, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

#### Annotations:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at various points.
- The DFS correctly identifies connected components of tangent disks.
- The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are updated based on the tangency condition.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program's logic to identify connected components of tangent disks is correct.
- The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to represent the relationship between the radii of tangent disks. Specifically, `coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]` ensures that if the radius of disk `i` is adjusted by a certain amount, the radius of disk `j` is adjusted by the opposite amount to maintain tangency.
- The sum of `coef1` being non-zero indicates that there is a way to adjust the radii such that the sum of all radii strictly decreases. This is because a non-zero sum of `coef1` implies that there is a net change in the radii that satisfies the tangency condition while decreasing the total sum.

#### Conclusion:
The program's logic correctly determines if it is possible to adjust the radii of the disks to meet the problem's requirements. The annotations support this conclusion by showing the correct state transitions and coefficient updates.

**Final: True**
