You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from a disk at index `i`. It updates the `visited` list to mark disks that are reachable from disk `i`, adds these disks to the `nodes` list, and updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists based on the radius and position conditions. The function modifies these lists in place but does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine if we can adjust the radii of the disks such that:
1. Disks that were tangent remain tangent.
2. No two disks overlap.
3. The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the graph of tangent disks. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads `n`, the number of disks.
   - It then reads the coordinates `(x, y)` and radius `r` for each disk.

2. **DFS Initialization:**
   - `visited`: A list to keep track of which disks have been visited.
   - `coef0` and `coef1`: Coefficients used to represent the relationship between the radii of tangent disks.
   - `nodes`: A list to keep track of nodes (disks) in the current connected component of tangent disks.

3. **DFS Execution:**
   - For each disk `i` that hasn't been visited:
     - It initializes the coefficients `coef0[i]` and `coef1[i]`.
     - It starts a DFS from this disk.
     - After the DFS, it sums up the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` for all disks in the connected component.
     - If the sum of `coef1` is not zero, it sets `ok` to `True`.

4. **Output:**
   - If `ok` is `True`, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program attempts to determine if there is a way to adjust the radii such that the sum of all radii decreases while maintaining tangency.
- However, the logic to determine this is flawed. The program checks if the sum of `coef1` is not zero, but this does not directly correlate to whether the radii can be adjusted to meet the problem's requirements.
- The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to represent the relationship between the radii of tangent disks, but the program does not correctly use these coefficients to determine if the radii can be adjusted in the desired manner.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic to determine if the radii can be adjusted to meet the requirements is flawed.
