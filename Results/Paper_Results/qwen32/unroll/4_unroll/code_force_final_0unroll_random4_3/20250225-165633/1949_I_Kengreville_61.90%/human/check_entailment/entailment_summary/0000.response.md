### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the program meets the problem requirements. The problem requires checking if it is possible to change the radii of the disks in such a way that:

1. Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent.
2. No two disks overlap in a region of positive area.
3. The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `dfs`. Hereâ€™s the breakdown of what each function does and how they interact:

- **`func_1`**: This function reads the input values for the disks and initializes necessary data structures (`visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, `nodes`). It then iterates through each disk, and if a disk has not been visited, it calls the `dfs` function starting from that disk. After the DFS completes, it checks if the sum of `coef1` values for the nodes in the current DFS traversal is non-zero. If this condition is met for any traversal, it prints "YES", indicating that it is possible to adjust the radii as required. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

- **`dfs`**: This function performs a depth-first search starting from a given disk index `i`. It marks the disk as visited and adds it to the `nodes` list. It then iterates through all other disks to check if they are tangent to the current disk (i.e., the distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii). If a tangent disk has not been visited, it updates the `coef0` and `coef1` values for that disk and recursively calls `dfs` on that disk.

The key idea here is that the DFS is used to explore groups of disks that are tangent to each other. The `coef0` and `coef1` values are used to determine if there is a way to adjust the radii within each group such that the sum of the radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency and non-overlapping conditions.

However, there are a few issues that need to be considered:

1. **Correctness of DFS for Tangency Check**: The DFS correctly identifies groups of tangent disks. However, it does not explicitly check if the radii can be adjusted to meet the problem's conditions within each group. The condition `c1 != 0` is used to determine if there is a feasible adjustment, but the exact logic behind this condition is not clear from the provided code.

2. **Handling of Overlapping Disks**: The problem statement specifies that no two disks can overlap in a region of positive area after adjusting the radii. The code does not explicitly check for this condition, although the tangency condition should implicitly prevent overlap if the radii are adjusted correctly.

3. **Strict Decrease of Sum of Radii**: The code does not explicitly ensure that the sum of the radii strictly decreases. The condition `c1 != 0` is used to determine if there is a feasible adjustment, but it does not guarantee that the sum decreases.

Given these points, the provided code does not explicitly ensure all conditions of the problem are met. While it correctly identifies groups of tangent disks and uses a condition to determine if there is a feasible adjustment, it does not explicitly ensure that the sum of the radii strictly decreases and that no two disks overlap after adjustment.

### Correctness: **False**

The code may not be fully correct based on the problem requirements as it does not explicitly ensure that the sum of the radii strictly decreases and that no two disks overlap after adjustment.
