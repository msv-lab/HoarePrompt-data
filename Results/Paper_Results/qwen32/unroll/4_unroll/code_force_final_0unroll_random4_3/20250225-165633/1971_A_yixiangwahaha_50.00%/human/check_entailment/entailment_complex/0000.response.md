Reasoning:  
The program is intended to process `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y`. The program should output the minimum and maximum of each pair of integers. However, there is a discrepancy in the implementation. The program is hardcoded to read exactly 10 test cases regardless of the value of `t` provided by the user. This means that if `t` is less than 10, the program will wait for additional inputs that are not part of the test cases, and if `t` is greater than 10, it will only process the first 10 test cases and ignore the rest. This behavior does not align with the problem description, which specifies that the program should process exactly `t` test cases.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle the number of test cases correctly based on the input `t`.

Correctness: **False**
