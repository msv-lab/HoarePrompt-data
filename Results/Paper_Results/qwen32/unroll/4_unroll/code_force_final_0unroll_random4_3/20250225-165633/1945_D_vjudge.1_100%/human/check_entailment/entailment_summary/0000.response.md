### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue. Kirill can bribe people by paying `a_j` coins to swap with a person at position `j` and `b_k` coins for each person `k` between `j` and `i` (Kirill's current position).

The program calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to be among the first `m` people in the queue by iterating through each of the first `m` positions and considering the cost of bribing the person at that position plus the cost of bribing all people between that position and the end of the queue.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` (number of people in the queue excluding Kirill) and `m` (the maximum allowable final position of Kirill). It also reads the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - It creates a list `c` where `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This represents the minimum cost to "clear" a position `i` if Kirill were to swap with someone at position `i` or if he were to pass through position `i` without swapping.
   - It calculates a suffix sum array `suff` where `suff[i]` is the sum of the minimum costs from position `i` to the end of the queue. This helps in quickly calculating the cost of bribing all people from position `i` to the end.

3. **Finding Minimum Cost**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to infinity.
   - It iterates through the first `m` positions and calculates the cost of Kirill bribing the person at position `i` and then bribing all people from position `i+1` to the end. This cost is `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`.
   - It keeps track of the minimum cost encountered during this iteration.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the minimum cost `ans`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue. The use of the suffix sum array `suff` optimizes the calculation of the total cost, making the solution efficient.
