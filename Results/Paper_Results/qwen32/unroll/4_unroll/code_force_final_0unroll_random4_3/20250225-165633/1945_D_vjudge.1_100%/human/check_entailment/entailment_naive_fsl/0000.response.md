Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
Kirill is in a queue and can bribe people to move forward. He can bribe the person at position `j` to swap places with him, paying `a_j` coins, and additionally pay `b_k` coins for each person `k` between `j` and his current position `i`. The goal is to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program defines a function `func_1` which seems to be calculating the minimum coins Kirill needs to spend. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` (the number of people in the queue), `m` (the maximum allowable final position of Kirill), and two lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The program creates a list `c` where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`. This seems to assume that Kirill can choose the cheaper option between `a_j` and `b_k` for each person, which is not accurate according to the problem description.

3. **Suffix Sum Calculation**: The program calculates a suffix sum array `suff` where `suff[i]` is the sum of the elements in `c` from index `i` to the end of the array. This is used to calculate the total cost of bribing people from position `i+1` to the end.

4. **Minimum Cost Calculation**: The program iterates over the first `m` positions and calculates the minimum cost Kirill needs to spend by considering the cost of bribing the person at position `i` and the suffix sum from `i+1`.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The program incorrectly assumes that Kirill can choose the cheaper option between `a_j` and `b_k` for each person, which is not correct. The problem description states that bribing a person at position `j` incurs a cost of `a_j` plus `b_k` for each person `k` between `j` and `i`. The program does not account for the additional `b_k` costs correctly.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 2
10 2 3
1 10 1
```
- For `i = 1`, the cost should be `10 + (1 + 10) = 21`.
- For `i = 2`, the cost should be `2 + 1 = 3`.

The correct answer is `3`, but the program will incorrectly calculate it as `min(10 + (1 + 10), 2 + 1) = min(21, 3) = 3`, which happens to be correct in this case but due to incorrect logic.

However, consider another test case:
```
1
3 2
10 2 3
100 1 1
```
- For `i = 1`, the cost should be `10 + (100 + 1) = 111`.
- For `i = 2`, the cost should be `2 + 1 = 3`.

The correct answer is `3`, but the program will incorrectly calculate it as `min(10 + (100 + 1), 2 + 1) = min(111, 3) = 3`, which again happens to be correct but due to incorrect logic.

A more illustrative counterexample:
```
1
3 2
10 2 3
1 100 1
```
- For `i = 1`, the cost should be `10 + (1 + 100) = 111`.
- For `i = 2`, the cost should be `2 + 1 = 3`.

The correct answer is `3`, but the program will incorrectly calculate it as `min(10 + (1 + 100), 2 + 1) = min(111, 3) = 3`, which again happens to be correct but due to incorrect logic.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly account for the additional `b_k` costs when calculating the total cost of bribing people. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**

The program's logic is flawed and does not accurately reflect the problem description.
