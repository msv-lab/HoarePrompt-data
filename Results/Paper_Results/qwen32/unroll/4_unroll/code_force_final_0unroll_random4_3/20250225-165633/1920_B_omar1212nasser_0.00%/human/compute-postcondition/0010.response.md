Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers, and `elements` is a list of integers. The function returns 0 if certain conditions are met. Otherwise, it returns the maximum value from a list `pos` that contains `removals + 1` elements, starting with `s - 2 * n` and followed by `removals` additional elements computed during the loop.**
