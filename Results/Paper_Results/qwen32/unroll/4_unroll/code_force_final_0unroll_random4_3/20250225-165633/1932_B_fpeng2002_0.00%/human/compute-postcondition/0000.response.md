`num_tests` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. This means `num_tests` will hold the number of test cases provided by the user. The initial state of `t`, `n`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are not affected by this line.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is the integer value provided by the user input.**
