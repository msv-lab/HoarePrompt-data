You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n distinct integers such that 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n].
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)
        
    #State: The output will consist of `n` lines, each either `2` or `3`, depending on the input values for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not always correctly determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp must send to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Logic for Finding Pairs**:
   The program checks if there exists a pair of friends (i, p_i) such that p_i is the best friend of i and vice versa (i.e., l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1). If such a pair is found, it prints `2` because only two invitations are needed to bring both friends to the party. This is correct for cases where such a pair exists.

2. **Handling Cases Without Pairs**:
   If no such pair is found, the program defaults to printing `3`. However, this is not always correct. For example, consider the case where there are no pairs but there are cycles or other structures that allow fewer than 3 invitations to bring at least 2 friends.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Cycles**: If there are cycles of length 3 or more, it might be possible to bring at least 2 friends with fewer than 3 invitations.
   - **Disconnected Pairs**: If there are multiple pairs but no single pair, the program might incorrectly default to `3` when it could be `2` if two separate pairs can be found.

Let's provide a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Counterexample**:
```
2
4
2 3 4 1
4
1 2 3 4
```
**Expected Output**:
```
2
2
```
**Actual Output** (from the given program):
```
3
3
```

In the first test case, friends 1 and 2 form a pair, and friends 3 and 4 form another pair. Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1 and 3, and both pairs will come to the party, making the minimum number of invitations `2`.

In the second test case, there are no pairs, but friends 1 and 2 form a cycle, and friends 3 and 4 form another cycle. Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1 and 3, and both pairs will come to the party, making the minimum number of invitations `2`.

Thus, the program fails to handle these cases correctly and defaults to `3` invitations unnecessarily. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
