To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(n):`. The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and `n` is the upper limit for the range function.

Given the provided state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000
- `n` is the input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50
- `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers such that 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n]

To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. However, from the problem statement, we know that `n` is already constrained to be between 2 and 50, which means `n` is always greater than 0. Therefore, `n` does not need to be adjusted.

The variable `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts since it is initialized by the `range(n)` function in the loop head.

Thus, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute. The state remains as provided.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers such that 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n]**
