The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 5000, and for each test case, `n` is an integer within the range 2 to 50, and `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers with specific constraints. After executing the code snippet, the value of `n` changes to the integer input provided, but the constraints on `n` (2 <= n <= 50) should still hold for the input to be valid. The variable `t` and the list `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers such that 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n].**
