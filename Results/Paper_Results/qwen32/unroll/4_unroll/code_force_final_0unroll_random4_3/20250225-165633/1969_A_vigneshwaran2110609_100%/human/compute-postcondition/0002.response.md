To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's analyze the provided code and the given initial state.

The initial state includes:
- `t`: an integer from 1 to 5000.
- `n`: an integer from 2 to 50.
- `p`: a list of `n` distinct integers such that each integer is between 1 and `n`, and no integer `p_i` is equal to `i` for any `i` in the range [1, n].

The loop code is:
```python
for i in range(n):
    x = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    for i in range(0, x):
        if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
            flag = True
            print(2)
            break
    else:
        print(3)
```

Here's what the loop does:
- For each iteration `i` from 0 to `n-1`, it reads an integer `x` and a list `l` of `x` integers.
- It then checks if there exists an index `i` (from 0 to `x-1`) such that `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1`.
- If such an index is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the inner loop.
- If no such index is found after checking all `x` elements, it prints `3`.

Since the loop runs `n` times and each iteration prints either `2` or `3` based on the condition, the output will consist of `n` lines, each either `2` or `3`.

The variables `t`, `n`, and `p` are not modified within this loop and are not used in the loop's logic, so they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state will be determined by the values printed in each of the `n` iterations of the loop.

Output State: **The output will consist of `n` lines, each either `2` or `3`, depending on the input values for each iteration.**
