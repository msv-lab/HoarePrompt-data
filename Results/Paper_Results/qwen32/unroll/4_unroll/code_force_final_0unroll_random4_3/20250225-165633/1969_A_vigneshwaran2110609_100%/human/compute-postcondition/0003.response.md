Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. Each integer `p_i` in the list satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i != i for all i in [1, n]. For each test case, the function returns the number of integers in the list `p` that are in their "correct" position, defined as p_i = i.**
