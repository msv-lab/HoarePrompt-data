### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum profit Bob can make from selling his buns, given the promotion rules. The solution involves:

1. **Identifying the optimal number of buns (`k`) to sell at the modified price**:
   - The price of the i-th bun sold at the modified price is `(b - i + 1)` coins.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each.
   - We need to find the value of `k` that maximizes the total profit.

2. **Conditions to determine `k`**:
   - If the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price of the first bun `b`, then selling all buns at the usual price `a` would yield the maximum profit.
   - If `a` is less than `b`, then it might be beneficial to sell some buns at the modified price. The maximum `k` can be `min(b - a + 1, n)` because the price of the buns at the modified price decreases until it reaches `a` or we run out of buns.

3. **Calculating the total profit**:
   - The profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price is the sum of an arithmetic series: `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`.
   - The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price is `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two amounts.

The provided code correctly implements the above logic:

- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- It checks if `a >= b` and, if true, prints `n * a`.
- Otherwise, it calculates `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n)` and computes the total profit using the arithmetic series formula and the profit from the remaining buns.
- It prints the total profit for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The code correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can make from selling his buns based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
