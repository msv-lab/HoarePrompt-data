Let's carefully analyze the provided Python program and verify its correctness based on the problem description and the function summary.

### Problem Breakdown and Key Points

1. **When `a >= b`:** If the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the starting price `b`, it's always better to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. This is because the promotional price will never be higher than the usual price.

2. **When `a < b`:** We need to determine the optimal number `k` of buns to sell at the promoted price. The promotional price decreases linearly from `b` to `(b - k + 1)`. The sum of this arithmetic series is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence: `S = (first_term + last_term) * number_of_terms / 2`. Here, `first_term = b`, `last_term = (b - k + 1)`, and `number_of_terms = k`. The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns is simply `(n - k) * a`.

3. **Optimal `k`:** The optimal `k` is the maximum possible value that doesn't exceed `n` or the point where the promotional price becomes less than or equal to the usual price `a`. Thus, `k` is `min(b - a + 1, n)`.

### Program Analysis

The program follows these steps:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. If `a >= b`, it calculates the profit as `n * a`.
4. If `a < b`, it calculates the optimal `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n)`.
5. It calculates the profit from the first `k` buns using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence.
6. It calculates the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns as `(n - k) * a`.
7. It prints the total profit.

### Detailed Verification

Let's break down the logic in the code:

- **Case 1: `a >= b`**
  - The program correctly calculates the profit as `n * a` when `a >= b`.
  - This matches the logic described in the problem breakdown.

- **Case 2: `a < b`**
  - The program calculates `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n)`, which correctly identifies the maximum number of buns that can be sold at the promotional price.
  - The profit from the first `k` buns is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence: `ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
  - The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns is correctly calculated as `p2 = (n - k) * a`.
  - The total profit is then the sum of `ans` and `p2`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit based on the given conditions. It handles both scenarios (`a >= b` and `a < b`) appropriately and calculates the profit accurately.

**Correctness: True**
