You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then prints 'NO' if both `a` and `b` are odd or if one is exactly half of the other; otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description:

### Problem Description Recap:
Bob has a rectangle of size `a x b`. He tries to cut this rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles as he wishes. Two rectangles differing only by a 90° rotation are considered the same. Bob needs to determine if he can obtain some other rectangle from the `a x b` rectangle.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program is:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

### Let's Evaluate the Conditions:
1. **Condition 1**: `if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:`
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program outputs "NO". This is correct because if both dimensions are odd, you cannot cut the rectangle into two identical smaller rectangles with integer sides.

2. **Condition 2**: `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:`
   - If one dimension is exactly half of the other, the program outputs "NO". This is correct because if one dimension is exactly half of the other, cutting the rectangle along the longer side will result in two rectangles of size `a/2 x b` or `a x b/2`, and these cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle different from the original.

3. **Else Case**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program outputs "YES". This is correct because if the dimensions are not both odd and one dimension is not exactly half of the other, it is always possible to cut the rectangle and rearrange the pieces to form a new rectangle.

### Testing Edge Cases:
- **Test Case 1**: `a = 1, b = 1`
  - Both dimensions are odd, so the output is "NO". Correct.
- **Test Case 2**: `a = 2, b = 1`
  - One dimension is even and the other is odd, and one is not half of the other, so the output is "NO". Correct.
- **Test Case 3**: `a = 2, b = 6`
  - One dimension is not half of the other, so the output is "YES". Correct.
- **Test Case 4**: `a = 3, b = 2`
  - One dimension is not half of the other, so the output is "YES". Correct.
- **Test Case 5**: `a = 2, b = 2`
  - Both dimensions are even and one is half of the other, so the output is "YES". Correct.
- **Test Case 6**: `a = 2, b = 4`
  - One dimension is exactly half of the other, so the output is "NO". Correct.
- **Test Case 7**: `a = 6, b = 3`
  - One dimension is exactly half of the other, so the output is "NO". Correct.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to handle all the provided test cases correctly. There are no edge cases that seem to be missed based on the problem description and the given examples.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly handles all the described scenarios. If both dimensions are odd, it returns "NO". If one dimension is exactly half of the other, it returns "NO". In all other cases, it returns "YES", which aligns with the problem description.
