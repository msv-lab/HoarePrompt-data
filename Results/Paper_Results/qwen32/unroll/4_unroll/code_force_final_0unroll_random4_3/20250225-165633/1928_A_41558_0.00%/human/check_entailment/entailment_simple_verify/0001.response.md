### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to verify if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
Bob has a rectangle of size `a x b` and wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles with integer sides. The goal is to determine if these two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Cut Parallel to Sides:**
   - If `a` is even, cutting parallel to `a` results in two rectangles of size `(a/2) x b`.
   - If `a` is odd, cutting parallel to `a` results in two rectangles of size `((a-1)/2) x b` and `1 x b`.
   - If `b` is even, cutting parallel to `b` results in two rectangles of size `a x (b/2)`.
   - If `b` is odd, cutting parallel to `b` results in two rectangles of size `a x ((b-1)/2)` and `a x 1`.

2. **Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the resulting pieces are `1 x b` and `((a-1)/2) x b` or `a x 1` and `a x ((b-1)/2)`, which cannot form a new rectangle with different dimensions.
   - If one of `a` or `b` is even, the resulting pieces can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
   - If `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`, the resulting pieces will be `a x (a/2)` or `(b/2) x b`, which are essentially the same rectangle as the original (rotated).

#### Program Analysis:
Let's look at the provided program and compare it with the above observations.

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

1. **Condition for Both Sides Odd:**
   - The condition `if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` correctly identifies cases where both `a` and `b` are odd, and in these cases, Bob cannot form a new rectangle. This part is correct.

2. **Condition for Half Dimensions:**
   - The condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a` correctly identifies cases where cutting the rectangle results in pieces that form the same rectangle (rotated). This part is also correct.

3. **Remaining Cases:**
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, it means that either one of `a` or `b` is even, or the dimensions are not half of each other, allowing Bob to form a new rectangle. This part is correct.

#### Annotations:
The annotations provided seem to correctly describe the state of the program at key points. They confirm that the program correctly handles the conditions for both sides being odd and for the dimensions being half of each other.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final: True**

The original assessment was accurate.
