### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a rectangle of size `a x b` can be cut and reformed into a different rectangle. The key points to consider are:

1. **Odd dimensions**: If both dimensions `a` and `b` are odd, then cutting the rectangle will result in smaller rectangles of odd dimensions, which cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle that is different from the original (since the only possible rearrangement would result in the same dimensions, just rotated).

2. **One dimension is half of the other**: If one dimension is exactly half of the other (e.g., `a = 2b` or `b = 2a`), then cutting the rectangle along the longer side will result in two rectangles of the same dimensions (`b x b` or `a x a`), which cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle that is different from the original (since the only possible rearrangement would result in the same dimensions, just rotated).

3. **Other cases**: If neither of the above conditions is met, it is always possible to cut the rectangle and rearrange the resulting pieces into a new rectangle that is different from the original.

The provided program correctly implements these conditions:
- It checks if both `a` and `b` are odd.
- It checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other.
- For all other cases, it returns 'YES'.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly determines whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given `a x b` rectangle based on the conditions outlined in the problem description.

### Correctness: **True**
