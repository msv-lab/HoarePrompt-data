To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all iterations, let's break down the code and understand its behavior.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Loop Iteration**: The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, the values of `n`, `k`, and `m` are read, followed by a string `s` of length `m`.
3. **Counting Unique Characters**:
   - `cnt` is used to count the number of times a complete set of `k` unique characters is found in the string `s`.
   - `cur` is a bitmask used to track the unique characters encountered so far in the current segment.
   - For each character `ss` in `s`, its position in the alphabet (0-based) is calculated using `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.
   - If the character has not been encountered in the current segment (`cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`), it is added to the bitmask (`cur += 1 << cur_ss`).
   - If all `k` unique characters have been encountered (`cur == (1 << k) - 1`), `cnt` is incremented, and `cur` is reset to 0.
4. **Output Decision**:
   - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, the output is `'YES'`.
   - If `cnt` is less than `n`, the output is `'NO'`, followed by a constructed string `ans`:
     - `ans` starts with the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times.
     - The next character added to `ans` is the first character from the first `k` characters that is not in the current bitmask `cur`.
     - The remaining characters in `ans` are filled with `'a'` until the length of `ans` is `n`.

### Output State:
After all iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` will retain their values as they were initially provided for each test case. The variables `cnt`, `cur`, and `tmp` will be reset at the start of each iteration and will not persist after the loop completes. The constructed string `ans` will be different for each test case depending on the values of `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s`.

Since the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` are the only ones that are not reset after each iteration and are part of the input, and given that the question asks for the state of these variables after all iterations, the final state will be the last set of values they held during the last iteration of the loop.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n`, `k`, `m` are integers as per the last test case, and `s` is the string of length `m` from the last test case.**
