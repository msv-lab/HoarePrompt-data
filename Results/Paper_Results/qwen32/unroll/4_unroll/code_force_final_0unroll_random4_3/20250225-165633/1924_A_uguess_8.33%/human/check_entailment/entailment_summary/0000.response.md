### Reasoning:

The provided program and its execution summary do not accurately reflect the problem description. Let's break down the problem and the program to understand why.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**:
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Length of the string to check for subsequences.
     - `k`: Number of unique lowercase English alphabets to use (up to the `k`-th letter).
     - `m`: Length of the string `s`.
     - `s`: A string of length `m` containing only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

2. **Output**:
   - For each test case, print "YES" if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in `s`.
   - If "NO", also print one such string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s`.
- It then iterates through the string `s` and uses a bitmask (`cur`) to track the presence of characters.
- If all `k` characters are seen (`cur == (1 << k) - 1`), it increments a counter (`cnt`).
- If `cnt` is at least `n`, it prints "YES".
- Otherwise, it prints "NO" and attempts to construct a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.

#### Issues in the Program:
- The logic for checking if all possible strings of length `n` occur as subsequences is incorrect. The program only checks if `n` distinct substrings containing all `k` unique letters appear in `s`, which is not the same as checking all possible strings of length `n`.
- The construction of the string when printing "NO" is incorrect. It does not ensure that the string is one that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.

#### Correct Approach:
- To solve the problem correctly, one would need to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and check if each one is a subsequence of `s`.
- This can be computationally expensive for large `n` and `k`, so optimizations or more efficient methods may be required.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, its correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
