The `while` loop in question is `while t:`. This loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is truthy. In Python, any non-zero integer is considered truthy, and zero is considered falsy.

Given the state right before the `while` loop: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `t` is already within a range that ensures it is truthy (i.e., `t` is at least 1 and at most 10,000). Therefore, no adjustment is needed to ensure that the loop can execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**
