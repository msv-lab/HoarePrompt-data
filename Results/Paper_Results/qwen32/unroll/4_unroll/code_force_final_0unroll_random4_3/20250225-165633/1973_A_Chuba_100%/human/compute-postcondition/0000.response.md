The provided Python code snippet only reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The initial state includes the scores `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` for each test case, but these are not affected by the given code. The only change is the introduction of the variable `t`, which is assigned the value of the input integer.

Output State: **Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order. The number of test cases t is the input integer.**
