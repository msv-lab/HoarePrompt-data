### Reasoning:

The original assessment appears to be accurate. The program correctly handles the problem requirements and edge cases as described. Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Total Score Parity Check**:
   - The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the program outputs `-1` because it is impossible to achieve an odd total score with the given scoring rules (each game results in an even sum of points: 0+2, 2+0, or 1+1).
   - This check is correct and ensures that the program immediately identifies invalid score sets.

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - If the total score is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula: `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.
   - This formula is derived from the need to maximize the number of draws while ensuring that the remaining points can be distributed as wins and losses among the players.
   - The term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the calculation accounts for the scenario where the highest score `v[2]` is significantly higher than the sum of the other two scores, which would otherwise lead to an incorrect draw count.

3. **Verification Against Example Test Cases**:
   - The original assessment verifies the program against multiple example test cases, including edge cases, and confirms that the program produces the correct output for each case.
   - The detailed calculations and expected outputs match the program's behavior, indicating that the program is correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles the problem requirements and edge cases. It accurately calculates the maximum number of draws and correctly identifies invalid score sets by returning `-1` when the total score is odd.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
