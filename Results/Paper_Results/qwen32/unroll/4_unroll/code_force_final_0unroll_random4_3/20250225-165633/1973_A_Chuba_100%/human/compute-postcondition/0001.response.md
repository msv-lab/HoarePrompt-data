In the provided code snippet, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop variable here is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use inside the loop body. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `t`.

To ensure that the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The scores `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are mentioned as part of the state before the loop starts, but they are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to make the loop execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30**
