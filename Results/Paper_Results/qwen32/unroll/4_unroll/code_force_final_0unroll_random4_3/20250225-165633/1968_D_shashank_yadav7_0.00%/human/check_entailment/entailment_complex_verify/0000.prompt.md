You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

    #State: The output state after all the iterations of the loop will be a series of strings ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw") printed for each test case, based on the comparison of `bm` and `sm` after processing all the iterations for that test case.
    #
    #Since the problem does not specify the exact input values, we cannot provide a specific numerical output state. However, we can describe the state in terms of the output strings that will be printed.
    #
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, and lists `p` and `a`. For each test case, it calculates two scores, `bm` and `sm`, based on the values in `p` and `a`, and prints "Bodya" if `bm` is greater than `sm`, "Sasha" if `sm` is greater than `bm`, or "Draw" if they are equal.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program contains several issues that prevent it from correctly implementing the game rules and determining the winner as described in the problem statement.

1. **Incorrect Score Calculation**:
   - The code incorrectly calculates the scores for both players. The scores should be updated by adding the value of `a` at the current position for each turn. However, the code incorrectly adds `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` which does not align with the rules of the game.
   - The logic `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` is incorrect because it does not properly accumulate the scores for each turn. Instead, it seems to be trying to maximize the score in a way that is not specified in the problem description.

2. **Incorrect Position Update**:
   - The code updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha using `b = p[b] - 1` and `s = p[s] - 1`. This is correct in terms of moving to the next position as specified in the permutation. However, the issue arises from the incorrect score calculation logic that depends on these positions.

3. **Incorrect Loop Logic**:
   - The loop runs `n` times, but the game should run exactly `k` turns. The loop should run `k` times instead of `n` times. This discrepancy could lead to incorrect results, especially when `k` is less than `n`.

4. **Incorrect Initialization**:
   - The initial scores `sp` and `bp` are set to `a[s]` and `a[b]`, respectively. This is correct. However, the initial total scores `sm` and `bm` are set to `a[s] * k` and `a[b] * k`, which is incorrect. The scores should be initialized to `a[s]` and `a[b]` and then updated in each turn.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases such as when `k=0` (no turns are played), or when the starting positions are the same (`P_B == P_S`).

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:
- Consider the following input:
  ```
  1
  3 2 1 1
  2 3 1
  5 5 5
  ```
- The correct output should be `Draw` because both players start at the same position and the scores will be the same after 2 turns.
- However, the program might not handle this case correctly due to the incorrect score calculation logic.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all potential cases. Therefore, the answer is **False**.
