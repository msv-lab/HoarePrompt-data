Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each testcase, n, k, P_B, and P_S are integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. p is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and n inclusive. a is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is read from the input and assigned to the variable `t`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
