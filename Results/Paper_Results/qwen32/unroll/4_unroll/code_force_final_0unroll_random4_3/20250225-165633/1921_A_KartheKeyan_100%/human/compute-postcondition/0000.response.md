The given code is designed to read the number of test cases, `n`, and for each test case, it reads an integer `l` and calculates a value `s` based on the formula `(l//4) + (l-(4*(l//4)))//2`. It then prints the value of `s` and decrements `n` until all test cases are processed.

Given the initial state, the code does not use the coordinates of the corners of the square (`x_i, y_i`), which are provided in the problem description but are not used in the code snippet. Therefore, these coordinates remain unchanged.

The value of `n` is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the while loop until it reaches 0, meaning all test cases are processed. The variable `s` is recalculated for each test case and printed.

Since the coordinates of the square are not used in the code, the output state only reflects the changes to `n` and the calculation of `s` for each test case.

Output State: **There are `t` test cases where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100. For each test case, `l` is an integer read from input, `s` is calculated as `(l//4) + (l-(4*(l//4)))//2`, and printed. `n` is decremented by 1 after processing each test case until `n` is 0. The coordinates `x_i, y_i` remain unchanged.**
