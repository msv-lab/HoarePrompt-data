The provided code snippet is just a comment block and does not contain any executable Python code. Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`) are affected by this code. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, k, and x are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n. The array a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000 for each i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
