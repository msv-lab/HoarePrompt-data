You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap
Vladislav lays down cards in a specific order:
1. First, all odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest.
2. Next, all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest.
3. Then, all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest.
4. This continues until all cards are laid down.

The task is to determine the k-th card laid down.

### Analysis of the Provided Program

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` (total number of cards) and `k` (the position of the card to find).

2. **List `L` Calculation:**
   - The list `L` is intended to store the count of cards laid down in each step (odd multiples, 2*odd multiples, etc.).
   - However, the current implementation of the `while` loop does not populate `L` with any values. It just calculates `m` and subtracts it from `n`, which does not contribute to the logic of the problem.

3. **Logic to Find the k-th Card:**
   - The program initializes `tot` (total cards laid down so far) and `pow` (multiplication factor).
   - It then iterates over the list `L` to determine the k-th card:
     - If `tot < k <= tot + a`, it calculates the k-th card as `pow * (2 * k - 1)`.
     - It updates `tot` and `k` accordingly and multiplies `pow` by 2 for the next iteration.
   - Given that `L` is not populated correctly, this logic will not work as intended.

### Issues Identified:
- The list `L` is not being populated correctly.
- The logic to determine the k-th card relies on the correct values in `L`, which are not being computed.
- The program does not account for the specific sequence of card placements as described in the problem.

### Correctness
Given the issues identified, the program is incorrect. It does not correctly compute the sequence of card placements and thus cannot determine the k-th card accurately.

### Conclusion

Reasoning: The program fails to correctly compute the sequence of card placements and does not populate the list `L` with the necessary values to determine the k-th card. As a result, it cannot produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
