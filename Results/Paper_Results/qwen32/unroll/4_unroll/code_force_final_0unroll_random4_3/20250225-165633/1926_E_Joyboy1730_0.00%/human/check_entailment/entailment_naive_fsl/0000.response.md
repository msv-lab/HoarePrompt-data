Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not seem to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here are a few issues:

1. **Initialization and Usage of List `L`:** The list `L` is initialized but never populated. The program attempts to use `L` later, but it remains empty, which means no values are being stored or used.

2. **Logic for Determining Card Order:** The program does not generate the sequence of cards as described in the problem statement. It fails to lay down the odd-numbered cards first, then the cards that are twice an odd number, and so on.

3. **Calculation of `tot` and `k`:** The logic for adjusting `tot` and `k` is not correctly implemented. The program does not correctly determine the position of the k-th card in the sequence.

4. **Output of the k-th Card:** The program does not correctly output the k-th card. The formula `pow * (2 * k - 1)` is not appropriate for determining the k-th card in the sequence.

Here is an example of a case where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
7 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output:**
The program does not produce any output because the list `L` is empty, and the loop that would print the k-th card is never entered.

Since the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, it is incorrect.
