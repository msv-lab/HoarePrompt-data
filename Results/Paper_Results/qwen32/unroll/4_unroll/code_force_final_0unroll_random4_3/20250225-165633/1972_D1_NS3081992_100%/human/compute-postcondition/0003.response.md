To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to ensure that the condition `i <= m and i * i <= n + i` is satisfied.

Given:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^6\) and \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
- `i` is 1.
- `ans` is 0.

The loop condition is `i <= m and i * i <= n + i`.

Let's analyze the condition step-by-step:

1. **Condition `i <= m`**:
   - Since `i` is 1, this condition will be true if `m` is at least 1. Given that `m` is a positive integer, this condition is already satisfied.

2. **Condition `i * i <= n + i`**:
   - Substituting `i = 1`, the condition becomes `1 * 1 <= n + 1`, which simplifies to `1 <= n + 1`.
   - Since `n` is a positive integer (i.e., \(n \geq 1\)), `n + 1` will always be at least 2, so `1 <= n + 1` is always true.

Since both conditions are satisfied with the given initial values of `i`, `m`, and `n`, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the state remains the same:
State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`, and both are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `i` is 1; `ans` is 0**.
