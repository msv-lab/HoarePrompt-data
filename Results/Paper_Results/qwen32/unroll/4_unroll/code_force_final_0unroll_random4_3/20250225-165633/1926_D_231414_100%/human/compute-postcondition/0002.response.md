The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is used to iterate over the range of `times`. The loop will execute based on the value of `times`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `times` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The other variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `check` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, and `check` is 2147483647**
