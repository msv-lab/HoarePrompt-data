test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a tuple (n, integers) such that n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of integers, and integers is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_j < 2^31) representing the given integers. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
