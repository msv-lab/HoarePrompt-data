You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Program:
from collections import deque
import math

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ans = func_1(n, k, nums)
    print(ans)

def func_1(n, k, nums):
    if k >= sum(nums):
        return n
    (a, b) = (math.ceil(k / 2), k // 2)
    ans = 0
    s_a = 0
    s_b = 0
    for i in range(n):
        s_a += nums[i]
        s_b += nums[n - i - 1]
        if s_a <= a:
            ans += 1
        if s_b <= b:
            ans += 1
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of integers in the list `nums`; `k`, an integer; and `nums`, a list of `n` integers. It returns `n` if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the integers in `nums`. Otherwise, it returns `ans`, which is the total number of times the cumulative sums from the start (`s_a`) and from the end (`s_b`) of the list `nums` are less than or equal to `a` (which is `math.ceil(k / 2)`) and `b` (which is `k // 2`), respectively.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attack pattern as described in the problem. The function `func_1` attempts to calculate the number of ships sunk by the Kraken, but it does so in a way that does not accurately reflect the alternating attack pattern (first ship, last ship, first ship, etc.).

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
5 7
3 2 1 4 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
1. Attack the first ship (3 -> 2)
2. Attack the last ship (2 -> 1)
3. Attack the first ship (2 -> 1)
4. Attack the last ship (1 -> 0) -> Ship 5 sinks
5. Attack the first ship (1 -> 0) -> Ship 1 sinks
6. Attack the last ship (4 -> 3)
7. Attack the first ship (1 -> 0) -> Ship 2 sinks

So, the ships that sink are 1, 2, and 5, which totals 3 ships.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
The program will not produce the correct output because it does not simulate the alternating attack pattern correctly. The logic in the function `func_1` incorrectly attempts to sum the durability from both ends separately and compare it to half of the total attacks, which does not match the problem's requirements.

Thus, the program is incorrect for this case and potentially for others as well.
