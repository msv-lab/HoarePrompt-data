Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of integers in the list `nums`; `k`, an integer; and `nums`, a list of `n` integers. For each test case, the function returns either the integer `n` or `ans`, which is the total number of times two conditions are met: `s_a` is less than or equal to `a` and `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`. However, based on the provided output description, it seems there might be a misunderstanding as it only specifies two distinct return cases which do not directly correlate to the parameters or a clear conditional logic. Assuming the second case is meant to be a computed value based on some internal logic not detailed here, the functionality can be described as returning either `n` or a computed `ans`.**
