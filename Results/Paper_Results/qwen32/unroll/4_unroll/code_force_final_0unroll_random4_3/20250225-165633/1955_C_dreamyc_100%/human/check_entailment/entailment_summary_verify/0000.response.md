Let's carefully analyze the given program and the function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap
The Kraken attacks ships in an alternating pattern: first ship, last ship, first ship, etc. Each attack reduces the durability of the ship by 1. If a ship's durability drops to 0, it sinks and is no longer subject to further attacks. The task is to determine how many ships will be sunk after `k` attacks.

### Provided Program Analysis
The provided program includes a function `func_1` which seems to attempt a solution by calculating cumulative sums from both ends of the list and comparing them to half of the total attacks. However, this method does not correctly simulate the alternating attack pattern described in the problem.

### Function Summary
The function summary explains that `func_1` returns `n` if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the integers in `nums`. Otherwise, it returns the number of times the cumulative sums from the start (`s_a`) and from the end (`s_b`) of the list `nums` are less than or equal to `a` (which is `math.ceil(k / 2)`) and `b` (which is `k // 2`), respectively.

### Evaluation
The function summary and the provided code do not accurately simulate the alternating attack pattern. Instead, it attempts to count the number of ships that can be sunk based on cumulative sums, which is not the correct approach.

Let's consider the example provided in the original assessment:

**Input:**
```
1
5 7
3 2 1 4 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
1. Attack the first ship (3 -> 2)
2. Attack the last ship (2 -> 1)
3. Attack the first ship (2 -> 1)
4. Attack the last ship (1 -> 0) -> Ship 5 sinks
5. Attack the first ship (1 -> 0) -> Ship 1 sinks
6. Attack the last ship (4 -> 3)
7. Attack the first ship (1 -> 0) -> Ship 2 sinks

So, the ships that sink are 1, 2, and 5, which totals 3 ships.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
The program does not simulate the alternating attack pattern correctly and will not produce the correct output for this case.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attack pattern and does not accurately determine the number of ships sunk. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect.
