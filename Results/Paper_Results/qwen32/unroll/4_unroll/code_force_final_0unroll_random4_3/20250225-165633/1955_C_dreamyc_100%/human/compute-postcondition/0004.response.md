Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. Additionally, `k` is less than the sum of the integers in `nums`. `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, and `b` is `k // 2`. `ans` is 0.**

In the output state, the variable `ans` is initialized to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, `a`, and `b`) retain their initial values and conditions.
