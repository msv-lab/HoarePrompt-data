Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of integers in the list `nums`; `k`, an integer; and `nums`, a list of `n` integers. It returns `n` if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the integers in `nums`. Otherwise, it returns `ans`, which is the total number of times the cumulative sums from the start (`s_a`) and from the end (`s_b`) of the list `nums` are less than or equal to `a` (which is `math.ceil(k / 2)`) and `b` (which is `k // 2`), respectively.**
