You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

- Program:
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b, c, d):
    request = f'? {a} {b} {c} {d}'
    print(request, flush=True)
    return input()

    for i in range(1, n):
        ans = func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)
        if ans == '<':
            max_item_idx = i
    pair_idx = max_item_idx
    for i in range(n):
        ans1 = func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)
        if ans1 == '<':

        elif ans1 == '=':
            ans2 = func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)
            if ans2 == '>':
                pair_idx = i
    print(f'! {max_item_idx} {pair_idx}')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` takes an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^4) and prints two indices, `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`, based on the comparisons made within the function. The final output is always `! n-1 n-1` under the given code structure and assumptions.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the provided Python program is correct, we need to analyze the logic and see if it adheres to the problem requirements and constraints.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective:**
   - Find two indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized.
   
2. **Allowed Operations:**
   - Ask queries of the form `? a b c d` and receive a comparison of `(p_a | p_b)` and `(p_c | p_d)`.
   - Use at most `3n` queries per test case.
   
3. **Approach:**
   - The program first identifies the maximum element in the permutation.
   - Then, it tries to find the element that, when XORed with the maximum element, gives the maximum result.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
- **Function `func_1`:** 
  - This function sends a query to the interactor and receives the response.
  - It prints the query and flushes the output, which is essential for the interactor to receive the query.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - **Finding the Maximum Element:**
    - The program initializes `max_item_idx` to 0.
    - It iterates through the permutation to find the index of the maximum element using queries.
    - For each index `i`, it compares `(p[max_item_idx] | p[max_item_idx])` with `(p[i] | p[i])`.
    - If the response is `<`, it updates `max_item_idx` to `i`.
    - This ensures that `max_item_idx` points to the maximum element in the permutation.
    - This part uses `n-1` queries.

  - **Finding the Optimal Pair:**
    - The program initializes `pair_idx` to `max_item_idx`.
    - It iterates through the permutation to find the index `i` such that `p[max_item_idx] ⊕ p[i]` is maximized.
    - For each index `i`, it compares `(p[max_item_idx] | p[pair_idx])` with `(p[max_item_idx] | p[i])`.
    - If the response is `<`, it updates `pair_idx` to `i`.
    - If the response is `=`, it further compares `(p[pair_idx] | p[pair_idx])` with `(p[i] | p[i])` to ensure `pair_idx` points to the correct element.
    - This part uses `2n` queries in the worst case.

- **Total Queries:**
  - The total number of queries used is `n-1 + 2n = 3n-1`, which is within the allowed limit of `3n` queries per test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the maximum element and then finds the optimal pair of indices such that their XOR is maximized. It uses a reasonable number of queries within the allowed limit. Therefore, the program is correct.
