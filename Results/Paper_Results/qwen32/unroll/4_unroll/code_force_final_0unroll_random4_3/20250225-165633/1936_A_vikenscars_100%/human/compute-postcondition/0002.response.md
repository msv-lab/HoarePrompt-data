To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the `func_1` function and how it affects the `max_item_idx` variable.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    ans = func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)
    if ans == '<':
        max_item_idx = i
```

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. In each iteration, it calls `func_1` with the current `max_item_idx` and `i`. The function `func_1` returns a string, and if this string is `'<'`, then `max_item_idx` is updated to `i`.

Without the exact definition of `func_1`, we can infer the following:
- If `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns `'<'`, it means that the current `i` is considered "greater" than the current `max_item_idx` according to the logic inside `func_1`.
- The loop will continue to update `max_item_idx` to the highest value of `i` for which `func_1` returns `'<'`.

Assuming that `func_1` is designed in such a way that it returns `'<'` when the second argument (which is `i` in this case) is greater than the first argument (which is `max_item_idx`), then `max_item_idx` will be updated to the highest value of `i` in the range `[1, n-1]`.

Thus, after the loop completes, `max_item_idx` will be `n-1`.

Output State: **max_item_idx is n-1**.
