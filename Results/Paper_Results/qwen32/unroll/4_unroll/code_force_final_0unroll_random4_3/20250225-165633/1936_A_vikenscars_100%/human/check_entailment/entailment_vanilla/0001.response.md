To determine if the provided Python program is correct, we need to analyze the logic and see if it adheres to the problem requirements and constraints.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective:**
   - Find two indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized.
   
2. **Allowed Operations:**
   - Ask queries of the form `? a b c d` and receive a comparison of `(p_a | p_b)` and `(p_c | p_d)`.
   - Use at most `3n` queries per test case.
   
3. **Approach:**
   - The program first identifies the maximum element in the permutation.
   - Then, it tries to find the element that, when XORed with the maximum element, gives the maximum result.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
- **Function `func_1`:** 
  - This function sends a query to the interactor and receives the response.
  - It prints the query and flushes the output, which is essential for the interactor to receive the query.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - **Finding the Maximum Element:**
    - The program initializes `max_item_idx` to 0.
    - It iterates through the permutation to find the index of the maximum element using queries.
    - For each index `i`, it compares `(p[max_item_idx] | p[max_item_idx])` with `(p[i] | p[i])`.
    - If the response is `<`, it updates `max_item_idx` to `i`.
    - This ensures that `max_item_idx` points to the maximum element in the permutation.
    - This part uses `n-1` queries.

  - **Finding the Optimal Pair:**
    - The program initializes `pair_idx` to `max_item_idx`.
    - It iterates through the permutation to find the index `i` such that `p[max_item_idx] ⊕ p[i]` is maximized.
    - For each index `i`, it compares `(p[max_item_idx] | p[pair_idx])` with `(p[max_item_idx] | p[i])`.
    - If the response is `<`, it updates `pair_idx` to `i`.
    - If the response is `=`, it further compares `(p[pair_idx] | p[pair_idx])` with `(p[i] | p[i])` to ensure `pair_idx` points to the correct element.
    - This part uses `2n` queries in the worst case.

- **Total Queries:**
  - The total number of queries used is `n-1 + 2n = 3n-1`, which is within the allowed limit of `3n` queries per test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the maximum element and then finds the optimal pair of indices such that their XOR is maximized. It uses a reasonable number of queries within the allowed limit. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
