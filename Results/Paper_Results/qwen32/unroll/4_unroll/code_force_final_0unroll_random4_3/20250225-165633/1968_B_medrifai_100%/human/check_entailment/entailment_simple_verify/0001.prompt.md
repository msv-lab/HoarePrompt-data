You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, a is a binary string of length n, and b is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n values across test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of all m values across test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function `func_1` is called with a, b, i, and j, where i and j are indices representing the current position in strings a and b, respectively.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given Python program correctly solves the problem, let's analyze the steps and logic involved.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find the maximum length \( k \) such that the prefix of string \( a \) of length \( k \) is a subsequence of string \( b \).

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the lengths \( n \) and \( m \) of strings \( a \) and \( b \), respectively.
   - Then it reads the strings \( a \) and \( b \).

2. **Main Logic**:
   - Two pointers \( i \) and \( j \) are initialized to 0. These pointers are used to traverse strings \( a \) and \( b \), respectively.
   - A counter \( c \) is initialized to 0. This counter keeps track of the length of the longest prefix of \( a \) that is a subsequence of \( b \).
   - A while loop runs as long as \( j \) is less than \( m \) (length of \( b \)) and \( i \) is less than \( n \) (length of \( a \)).
   - Inside the loop, the function `func_1` is called with arguments \( a \), \( b \), \( i \), and \( j \). This function searches for the character \( a[i] \) in the substring \( b[j:] \).
   - If `func_1` returns a valid index (not -1), it means the character \( a[i] \) was found in \( b[j:] \). The pointer \( j \) is updated to the position right after the found character, and both \( i \) and \( c \) are incremented by 1.
   - If `func_1` returns -1, it means the character \( a[i] \) was not found in \( b[j:] \), and the loop breaks.

3. **Helper Function `func_1`**:
   - This function searches for the character \( a[i] \) in the substring \( b[j:] \) using the `find` method.
   - If the character is found, it returns the index of the character relative to the start of \( b \) (hence `j + index`).
   - If the character is not found, it returns -1.

### Correctness Check
- The program correctly implements the logic to find the longest prefix of \( a \) that is a subsequence of \( b \).
- The use of two pointers and the helper function `func_1` ensures that the program efficiently searches for each character of \( a \) in \( b \) starting from the current position.
- The program handles all edge cases, such as when \( a \) or \( b \) is empty, or when no characters of \( a \) are found in \( b \).

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the program correctly solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
