You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, a is a binary string of length n, and b is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n values across test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of all m values across test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function `func_1` is called with a, b, i, and j, where i and j are indices representing the current position in strings a and b, respectively.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum possible number \( k \) such that a prefix of string \( a \) of length \( k \) is a subsequence of string \( b \).

Here's a breakdown of the code and its correctness:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the lengths of strings \( a \) and \( b \), then the strings themselves.

2. **Logic to Find the Maximum \( k \):**
   - Two pointers, `i` and `j`, are initialized to traverse strings \( a \) and \( b \) respectively.
   - The variable `c` keeps track of the length of the longest prefix of \( a \) that is a subsequence of \( b \).
   - The `while` loop continues as long as both pointers are within the bounds of their respective strings.
   - Inside the loop, the function `func_1` is called to find the next occurrence of the current character of \( a \) in the remaining part of \( b \).
   - If `func_1` returns a valid index (`new_j`), the pointers are updated, and `c` is incremented.
   - If `func_1` returns `-1`, it means the current character of \( a \) is not found in the remaining part of \( b \), and the loop breaks.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function finds the next occurrence of the character `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]`.
   - It uses the `find` method, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring (in this case, a single character) or `-1` if the substring is not found.
   - If the character is found, the function returns the index adjusted by `j` to get the correct position in the original string \( b \).
   - If the character is not found, the function returns `-1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where \( a \) is entirely a subsequence of \( b \) (e.g., the fifth example).
   - It also handles cases where \( a \) has no common characters with \( b \) (e.g., the sixth example).
   - The program correctly processes cases where \( a \) is longer than \( b \) or vice versa.

Since the program correctly handles all the provided examples and edge cases, and there are no apparent issues in the logic, it can be concluded that the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Therefore, **Correctness: True**.
