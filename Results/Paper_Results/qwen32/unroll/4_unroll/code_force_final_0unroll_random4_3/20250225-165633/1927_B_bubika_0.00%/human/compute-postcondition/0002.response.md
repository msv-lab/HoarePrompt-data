The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which is the loop variable. The loop will execute for each test case, and the number of test cases is determined by the value of `t`. The state of `t` must ensure that the loop can execute, which means `t` must be an integer greater than or equal to 1.

The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, for the sake of completeness, we can state their initial conditions as given.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 zeros**
