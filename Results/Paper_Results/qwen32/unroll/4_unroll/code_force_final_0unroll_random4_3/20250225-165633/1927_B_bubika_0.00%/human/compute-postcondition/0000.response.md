The provided code snippet `a = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` assigns a string containing all the lowercase letters of the English alphabet to the variable `a`. This assignment does not affect the values of `t` or `n`, nor does it affect the list `a` that is mentioned in the initial state (which is presumably a list of integers, not a string).

Since the variable `a` in the initial state is a list of integers and the new assignment is a string, it is clear that the list `a` is being replaced by a string. The other variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; a is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**
