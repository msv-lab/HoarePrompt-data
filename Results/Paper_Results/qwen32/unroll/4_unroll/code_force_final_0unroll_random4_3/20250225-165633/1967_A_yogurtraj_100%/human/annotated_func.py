#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^5.

    #State: the sequence of results for each test case, printed line by line.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` (number of elements), a non-negative integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates and prints a specific result for each test case based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the sorted list `a`.
