### Reasoning:

The provided program determines if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the specified operations. The core logic of the program is to check the uniformity of the first and last rows and the first and last columns. Here's a detailed breakdown of why this logic works:

1. **Uniform Rows and Columns Check**: 
   - The program checks if the first row (`a[0]`) is uniform (all characters are the same) and different from the last row (`a[-1]`). If this condition is true, it means there is a conflict between the first and last rows that cannot be resolved by the given operations, so it prints 'NO'.
   - Similarly, the program checks if the first column (`first_row`) is uniform and different from the last column (`last_row`). If this condition is true, it means there is a conflict between the first and last columns that cannot be resolved by the given operations, so it prints 'NO'.

2. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - If either the first and last rows or the first and last columns are uniform and different, it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform because there will always be a row or column that remains different.
   - If neither of these conditions is true, it is possible to make the entire grid uniform. This is because you can always use the operations to propagate the color of a uniform row or column to the rest of the grid.

3. **Examples**:
   - **First Example (NO)**: The first row is "W" and the last row is "B". Since they are different and uniform, it is impossible to make the grid uniform.
   - **Second Example (YES)**: The grid can be made uniform by performing the operations as shown in the diagram.
   - **Third Example (YES)**: All squares are already the same color.
   - **Fourth Example (YES)**: All squares are already the same color.
   - **Fifth Example (YES)**: The grid can be made uniform by performing the operations described in the problem statement.
   - **Sixth Example (NO)**: The first column is "B" and the last column is "W". Since they are different and uniform, it is impossible to make the grid uniform.
   - **Seventh Example (YES)**: All squares are already the same color.
   - **Eighth Example (NO)**: The first column is "W" and the last column is "B". Since they are different and uniform, it is impossible to make the grid uniform.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color based on the given operations. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
