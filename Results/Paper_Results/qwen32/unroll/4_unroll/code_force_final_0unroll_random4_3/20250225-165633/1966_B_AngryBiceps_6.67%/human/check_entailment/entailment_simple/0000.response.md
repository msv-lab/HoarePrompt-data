### Reasoning:

The given problem requires determining if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing a series of operations. The key insight here is that for all squares to be made the same color, certain conditions must be met based on the initial configuration of the grid.

Let's analyze the logic in the provided code:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It then reads `n` lines of `m` characters each, representing the grid.

2. **Building `first_row` and `last_row`:**
   - `first_row` is constructed by taking the first character of each row.
   - `last_row` is constructed by taking the last character of each row.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The code checks if all characters in the first row are the same (`len(set(a[0])) == 1`) and if the first and last rows are different (`a[0] != a[-1]`). If both conditions are true, it prints "NO".
   - The code also checks if all characters in `first_row` are the same (`len(set(first_row)) == 1`) and if `first_row` and `last_row` are different (`first_row != last_row`). If both conditions are true, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Analysis of Conditions:

- **Condition 1:** `len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]`
  - This condition checks if the first row is uniform (all characters the same) but different from the last row. If true, it implies that the first and last rows cannot be made uniform through the operations described because the first and last rows have different colors at the first column.

- **Condition 2:** `len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row`
  - This condition checks if the first column is uniform (all characters the same) but different from the last column. If true, it implies that the first and last columns cannot be made uniform through the operations described because the first and last columns have different colors at the first row.

- If neither of these conditions is met, it means that either:
  - The first and last rows are the same, or the first row is not uniform.
  - The first and last columns are the same, or the first column is not uniform.
  - In either case, it is possible to make the entire grid uniform through a series of operations.

### Conclusion:

The logic in the code correctly identifies the conditions under which it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color. If either of the conditions is met, it correctly prints "NO". Otherwise, it correctly prints "YES".

Thus, the program is correct based on the provided logic and the problem description.
