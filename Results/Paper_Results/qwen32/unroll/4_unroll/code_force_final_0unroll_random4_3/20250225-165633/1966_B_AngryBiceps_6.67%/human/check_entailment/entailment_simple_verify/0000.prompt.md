You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

- Program:

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = []
        first_row = ''
        last_row = ''
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 500. The grid is represented by n lines, each containing m characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'. The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description.

The problem description states that we need to determine whether it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the given operations. The key observation here is that if there exists a rectangle (of any size) that contains both 'W' and 'B', then it's impossible to make the entire grid one color. If all squares in the grid can be partitioned into rectangles of the same color, then it is possible to make the entire grid one color.

The provided code checks only two conditions:
1. If the first and last rows of the grid are the same and consist of a single color.
2. If the first and last columns of the grid are the same and consist of a single color.

If either of these conditions is not met, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".

However, these conditions are not sufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made the same color. There could be a scenario where the first and last rows and columns meet the conditions, but there is still a subrectangle within the grid that contains both 'W' and 'B', making it impossible to make the entire grid one color.

Let's consider a counterexample:
```
3 3
BWB
BWB
BWB
```
In this grid, the first and last rows and columns are the same and consist of a single color when considering only the first and last elements. However, the grid contains both 'W' and 'B', and there is no way to make the entire grid one color using the given operations.

Thus, the provided code does not handle all cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases. It only checks if the first and last rows and columns are the same and consist of a single color, which is not a sufficient condition to determine if the entire grid can be made the same color. There can be cases where the first and last rows and columns meet the conditions, but there is still a subrectangle within the grid that contains both 'W' and 'B', making it impossible to make the entire grid one color.
