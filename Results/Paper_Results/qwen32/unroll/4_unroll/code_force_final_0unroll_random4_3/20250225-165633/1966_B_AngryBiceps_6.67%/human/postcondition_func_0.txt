The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a grid of dimensions `n` by `m` filled with characters 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, it determines whether the grid meets a specific condition: it prints 'NO' if the first row is uniform (all characters are the same) and different from the last row, or if the first column (formed by the first character of each row) is uniform and different from the last column (formed by the last character of each row). Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.
