For the given task, the for loop iterates over a range derived from the input `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the function `input()`. Therefore, the only state we can adjust is the value of `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means the loop will execute `int(input())` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
3. Since `t` is already defined as an integer such that `1 <= t <= 100`, it ensures that `int(input())` will be a positive integer, and thus the loop will execute.

Given this, no further adjustments are needed to the state of `t` or any other variables in the loop head since `t` already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100**
