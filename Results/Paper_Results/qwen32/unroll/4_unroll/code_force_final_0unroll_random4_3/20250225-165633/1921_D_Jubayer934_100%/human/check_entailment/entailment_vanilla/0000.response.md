Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to maximize the total difference \( D \) between two arrays \( a \) and \( c \), where \( c \) is formed by selecting \( n \) integers from \( m \) integers in array \( b \) and arranging them in some order. The total difference is defined as \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \).

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve the problem as follows:
1. **Input Reading**: It reads the number of test cases \( t \), and for each test case, it reads the integers \( n \) and \( m \), the array \( a \) of \( n \) integers, and the array \( b \) of \( m \) integers.
2. **Sorting**: It sorts the array \( a \) in ascending order and the array \( b \) in descending order.
3. **Selection and Calculation**:
   - It initializes an empty list `ans` to store the absolute differences.
   - It iterates through the first \( n \) elements of \( a \) and \( b \) and calculates the absolute difference between corresponding elements. If the difference using the smallest remaining element of \( b \) is greater than the difference using the largest remaining element of \( b \), it switches strategies.
   - If a switch is needed (i.e., `temp != -1`), it continues calculating the differences using the smallest remaining elements of \( b \) for the remaining elements of \( a \).
4. **Output**: It prints the sum of the differences stored in `ans`.

### Issues in the Program
The main issue with the program is its strategy for selecting elements from \( b \). The program tries to switch strategies if the difference using the smallest remaining element of \( b \) is greater than the difference using the largest remaining element of \( b \). However, this approach does not necessarily maximize the total difference \( D \).

### Correct Strategy
To maximize the total difference \( D \), we should pair the smallest elements of \( a \) with the largest elements of \( b \) and the largest elements of \( a \) with the smallest elements of \( b \). This way, we maximize the absolute differences.

### Correct Implementation
A correct implementation would be:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        # Select the n largest from b and n smallest from b
        b_large = b[-n:]
        b_small = b[:n]
        # Calculate the maximum possible difference
        D = sum(abs(a[i] - b_large[i]) for i in range(n)) + sum(abs(a[i] - b_small[i]) for i in range(n))
        # The correct answer is the maximum of these two sums
        print(max(sum(abs(a[i] - b_large[i]) for i in range(n)), sum(abs(a[i] - b_small[i]) for i in range(n))))

func()
```

### Conclusion
The given program does not correctly implement the strategy to maximize the total difference \( D \). Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
