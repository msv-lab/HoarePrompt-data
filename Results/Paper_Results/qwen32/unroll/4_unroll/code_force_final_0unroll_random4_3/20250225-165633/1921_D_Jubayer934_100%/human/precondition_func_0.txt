t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. b is a list of m integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^9. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
