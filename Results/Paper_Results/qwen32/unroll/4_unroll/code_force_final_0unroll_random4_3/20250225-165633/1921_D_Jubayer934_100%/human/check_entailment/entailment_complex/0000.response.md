### Reasoning:

The task is to maximize the total difference \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \) by selecting \( n \) integers from the list \( b \) and arranging them to form the array \( c \).

The program provided follows a strategy to maximize this difference:
1. **Sorting**: 
   - The array \( a \) is sorted in ascending order.
   - The array \( b \) is sorted in descending order.
   
2. **Selection**:
   - For each element in the sorted array \( a \), the program compares the absolute difference between the current element in \( a \) and the corresponding elements from the start and end of the sorted array \( b \).
   - The goal is to choose the larger difference for each element in \( a \) to maximize the total difference \( D \).

3. **Logic**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted array \( a \) and compares the absolute differences between each element in \( a \) and the corresponding elements from the start and end of the sorted array \( b \).
   - If the difference with the element from the end of \( b \) is larger, it switches to using elements from the end of \( b \) for the remaining elements in \( a \).

4. **Implementation**:
   - The program correctly handles the selection process by maintaining a list `ans` that stores the absolute differences.
   - It then prints the sum of these differences for each test case.

### Verification:
The provided program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the total difference \( D \). It ensures that for each element in \( a \), the absolute difference with the corresponding element in \( b \) (either from the start or the end of the sorted \( b \)) is maximized.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it follows the optimal strategy to maximize the total difference \( D \) for each test case.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
