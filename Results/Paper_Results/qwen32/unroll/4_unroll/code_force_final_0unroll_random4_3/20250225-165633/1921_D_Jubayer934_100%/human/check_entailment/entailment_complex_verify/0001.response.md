### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not implement the optimal strategy to maximize the total difference \( D \). Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Sorting Strategy**:
   - The program sorts array \( a \) in ascending order and array \( b \) in descending order.
   - This initial sorting step is correct for the intended strategy of maximizing differences, but the subsequent approach to selecting elements from \( b \) is flawed.

2. **Selection and Calculation**:
   - The program iterates through the elements of \( a \) and \( b \) and calculates the absolute difference between corresponding elements.
   - If the difference using the smallest remaining element of \( b \) is greater than the difference using the largest remaining element of \( b \), it switches strategies. However, this approach is not guaranteed to maximize the total difference \( D \).

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - To maximize the total difference \( D \), we should pair the smallest elements of \( a \) with the largest elements of \( b \) and the largest elements of \( a \) with the smallest elements of \( b \).
   - The correct approach is to calculate the total difference by considering two possible pairings:
     - Pairing the smallest elements of \( a \) with the largest elements of \( b \).
     - Pairing the largest elements of \( a \) with the smallest elements of \( b \).
   - The final result should be the maximum of these two sums.

4. **Evaluation of the Program**:
   - The provided program does not consistently follow the optimal strategy. It attempts to switch strategies based on a single comparison, which is insufficient to ensure the maximum difference.
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the program's logic for selecting elements from \( b \) is flawed and does not guarantee the maximum total difference \( D \).

### Conclusion:
Based on the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the strategy to maximize the total difference \( D \). Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Final: **False**
