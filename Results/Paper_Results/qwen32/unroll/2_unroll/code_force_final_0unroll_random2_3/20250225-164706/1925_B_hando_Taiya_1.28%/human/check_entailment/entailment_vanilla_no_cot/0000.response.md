Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the maximum balance of the problemset by iterating through potential divisors of `x` up to the integer square root of `x`. It checks two conditions for each divisor `i`:

1. If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, then `i` can be a potential balance.
2. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, then `x // i` can be a potential balance.

The program keeps track of the maximum balance found through these checks and prints it for each test case. This approach ensures that the balance is maximized while satisfying the constraints that the sum of the sub-problems' difficulties equals `x` and there are exactly `n` sub-problems.

The function `func_1` is called within the loop for each test case, and it handles the input parsing and calculation logic correctly. Thus, the program is correct for the given problem description.
