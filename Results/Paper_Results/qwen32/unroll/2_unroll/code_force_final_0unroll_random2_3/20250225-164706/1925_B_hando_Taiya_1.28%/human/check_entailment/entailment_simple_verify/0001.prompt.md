You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
from math import *

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, and for each of the t test cases, x and n are integers such that 1 <= x <= 10^8 and 1 <= n <= x.
def func_1():
    x, n = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
    #State: `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or its corresponding pair divisor `x // i` that is less than or equal to `n`. The values of `t`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to n or its corresponding pair divisor x // i that is also less than or equal to n)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the given program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Break a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals `x` and the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties is maximized.
2. **Constraints**:
   - `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000` (number of test cases)
   - `1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8` (difficulty of the main problem)
   - `1 ≤ n ≤ x` (number of sub-problems)

### Approach:
To maximize the GCD of the sub-problems, we need to look for the largest possible divisor `d` of `x` such that `x` can be divided into `n` parts, each of which is a multiple of `d`. This means:
- `x = d * (sum of parts)`
- The sum of parts should be `n`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.
2. **Finding the GCD**:
   - The program iterates over all divisors `i` of `x` from `1` to `isqrt(x)`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks two conditions:
     - `n <= x // i`: If `n` is less than or equal to the quotient of `x` divided by `i`, then `i` can be a possible GCD.
     - `n <= i`: If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, then `x // i` can be a possible GCD.
   - It keeps track of the maximum possible GCD found in `ans`.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Divisor Check**: The program correctly checks divisors up to the square root of `x` and considers both `i` and `x // i` as potential GCDs.
- **Condition Validation**: The conditions `n <= x // i` and `n <= i` ensure that the sub-problems can be formed with the given number `n`.
- **Output**: The program outputs the maximum possible GCD for each test case.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the example provided in the problem statement:
1. **Test Case 1**: `x = 10`, `n = 3`
   - Possible divisors: `1, 2, 5, 10`
   - For `i = 2`: `n <= x // i` (3 <= 5) is true, so `ans = 2`
   - For `i = 5`: `n <= i` (3 <= 5) is true, but `ans` is already 2, so no change.
   - Output: `2`
2. **Test Case 2**: `x = 5`, `n = 5`
   - Possible divisors: `1, 5`
   - For `i = 1`: `n <= x // i` (5 <= 5) is true, so `ans = 1`
   - Output: `1`
3. **Test Case 3**: `x = 420`, `n = 69`
   - Possible divisors: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420`
   - For `i = 6`: `n <= x // i` (69 <= 70) is true, so `ans = 6`
   - Output: `6`

Given the analysis and the verification of the example, the program correctly computes the maximum balance for each test case.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
