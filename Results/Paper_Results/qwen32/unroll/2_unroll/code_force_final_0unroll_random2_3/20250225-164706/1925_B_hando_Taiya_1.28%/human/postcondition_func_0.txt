The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n` and prints the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or its corresponding pair divisor `x // i` that is also less than or equal to `n`. The values of `t`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged after processing each test case.
