Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even, with new values provided by the input; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `0`; `idx` is `0`; `idx_v` is `1`; `curr_v` is `1`.**

In this output state, the variable `curr_v` has been assigned the value `1`. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
