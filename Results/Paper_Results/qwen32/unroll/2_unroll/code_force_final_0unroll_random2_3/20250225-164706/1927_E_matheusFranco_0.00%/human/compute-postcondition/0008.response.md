The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the value of the variable `result`. According to the initial state provided, the variable `result` is explicitly set to the string `'1 4 7 9 2 5 8 10 3 6'`. 

No further computation or change to `result` is described in the given precondition, so we can directly use this value.

Output: **1 4 7 9 2 5 8 10 3 6**
