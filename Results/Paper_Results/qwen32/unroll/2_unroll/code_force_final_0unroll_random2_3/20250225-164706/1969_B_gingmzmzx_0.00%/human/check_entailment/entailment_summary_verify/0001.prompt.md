You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a series of binary strings, each representing a test case. For each binary string, it calculates a specific value based on the arrangement of '0's and '1's in the string and prints this value. The function handles multiple test cases, where the total number of test cases is provided as input, and the length of each binary string is between 2 and 200,000 characters.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the solution is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s should come before all 1s) using the minimum cost. The cost of an operation is defined as the length of the substring being cyclically shifted.

### Key Observations:
1. **Optimal Strategy**: To minimize the cost, we should aim to move all 0s to the left of all 1s. The most efficient way to do this is to focus on the transitions from 1 to 0 within the string.
2. **Cost Calculation**: For each 0 that appears after a 1, we need to move it to the left of all 1s. The cost for moving a 0 that appears after `k` 1s is `k + 1` (the length of the substring that includes this 0 and all preceding 1s).
3. **Efficient Calculation**: Instead of calculating the cost for each 0 individually, we can keep a running count of 1s and 0s. Each time we encounter a 0 after a 1, we add the number of 1s seen so far to the total cost.

### Solution Analysis:
Let's break down the provided code:
1. **Input Reading**: The code reads the number of test cases and then each binary string.
2. **Counting Operations**:
   - `zeroes = s.count(0)`: This counts the total number of 0s in the string.
   - `cnt = [0, 0]`: This is a counter for the number of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - `ans = 0`: This variable accumulates the total cost.
3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - For each character `c` in the string:
     - If `c` is 0, it checks if there have been any 1s encountered so far (`cnt[1] > 0`). If so, it adds 1 to the cost (`ans += 1`).
     - If `c` is 1, it adds the number of 0s encountered so far to the cost (`ans += zeroes - cnt[0]`).
4. **Output**: The total cost `ans` is printed for each test case.

### Issues in the Provided Code:
The provided code does not correctly calculate the cost. Specifically:
- The cost calculation for 0s is incorrect. The cost for moving a 0 that appears after `k` 1s should be `k + 1`, not just 1.
- The cost calculation for 1s is also incorrect. The line `ans += zeroes - cnt[0]` does not accurately reflect the cost of moving 1s.

### Correct Approach:
- We should keep track of the number of 1s encountered so far.
- For each 0 encountered after a 1, we add the number of 1s seen so far to the total cost.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the provided code, the solution is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
