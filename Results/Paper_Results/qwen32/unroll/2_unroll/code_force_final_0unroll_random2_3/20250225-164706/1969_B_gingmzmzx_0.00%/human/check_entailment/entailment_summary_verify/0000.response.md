### Reasoning:

The provided program (`func_1`) does not correctly compute the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using the given cyclic shift operation. Let's analyze the program and the function summary to confirm this.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts of substrings, and the cost of each shift is the length of the substring being shifted. The goal is to find the minimum total cost to sort the string.

#### Program Analysis:
The program processes each binary string as follows:
- It counts the number of '0's in the string.
- It maintains a count of '0's and '1's encountered so far.
- For each character in the string:
  - If the character is '0' and there are any '1's encountered so far, it adds 1 to the cost.
  - If the character is '1', it adds the number of remaining '0's (total '0's minus the count of '0's encountered so far) to the cost.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
The function summary states that the function calculates a specific value based on the arrangement of '0's and '1's in the string, but it does not specify how this value relates to the cost of cyclic shifts. The summary does not indicate that the function correctly computes the minimum cost as described in the problem statement.

#### Example Analysis:
Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:
- Input: `101011`
- Expected Output: `5`

The expected output is derived from a series of cyclic shifts:
1. Choose substring [1, 3]: `101011 -> 011011` (cost = 3)
2. Choose substring [2, 4]: `011011 -> 001111` (cost = 3)
3. Total cost = 3 + 2 = 5

However, the provided program does not perform these cyclic shifts or calculate the costs correctly. Instead, it uses a different logic that does not match the problem's requirements.

#### Conclusion:
The program's logic does not correctly simulate the cyclic shifting and cost calculation as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
