Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `odds`, which is a list of integers representing subarray sums, and `n`, which is an integer representing the size of the palindrome array `a` with the constraint 3 <= n <= 1000. The function returns the list `a`, which is a palindrome array of size `n`.**
