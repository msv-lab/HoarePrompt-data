The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides information about two variables `n` and `k`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value of `n` and `k` does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `n` and `k` are positive integers.
   - The constraints are \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
   - `n` is not equal to `k`.
   - The current value of `n` is less than `k`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print('NO')` statement is executed.
   - The string `'NO'` is directly printed to the console.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` and `k`, the output is straightforward.

**Output: NO**

Final Answer:
Output: **NO**
