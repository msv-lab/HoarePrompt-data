You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    10 7

Output

Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        i = 0
        while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
            i = i + 1
        ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
        for j in range(20):
            if j != i:
                ans.append(1 << j)
        print(len(ans))
        print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates a list of integers based on the value of `k` and prints the length of this list followed by the list itself. The list is constructed such that it includes specific values derived from `k` and powers of 2, excluding the power of 2 that is closest to `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
  1. There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
  2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.
- The sequence `b` is a subsequence of `a` if `b` can be obtained from `a` by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

### Program Analysis:
The program constructs a sequence `ans` for each test case as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the integers `n` and `k`.
3. It determines the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` by incrementing `i` until `1 << (i + 1)` (which is `2^(i+1)`) is greater than `k`.
4. It initializes the sequence `ans` with three elements:
   - `k - (1 << i)` (which is `k - 2^i`)
   - `k + 1`
   - `k + 1 + (1 << i)` (which is `k + 1 + 2^i`)
5. It then appends `2^j` to `ans` for each `j` from `0` to `19` except `i`.
6. Finally, it prints the length of `ans` and the elements of `ans`.

### Checking the Conditions:
1. **No Subsequence Sums to `k`:**
   - The element `k - (1 << i)` is non-positive when `k` is a power of 2, and it is always less than `k` otherwise.
   - The elements `k + 1` and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` are clearly greater than `k`.
   - The remaining elements `2^j` for `j ≠ i` are all powers of 2 and thus cannot sum to `k` because `k` is not a sum of distinct powers of 2 (since `2^i` is the largest power of 2 ≤ `k`).

2. **Subsequences Sum to All Values from `1` to `n` Except `k`:**
   - The powers of 2 up to `2^19` can form any number up to `2^20 - 1` (which is much larger than `n`).
   - The inclusion of `k + 1` and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` ensures that sums involving these elements can be adjusted to reach values greater than `k`.
   - The element `k - (1 << i)` allows for adjustments to reach values less than `k` that are not powers of 2.

However, the construction of the sequence `ans` does not guarantee that all values from `1` to `n` can be formed except for `k`. Specifically, the sequence does not account for the possibility of forming sums that include `k` indirectly through combinations of elements.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly ensure that all values from `1` to `n` can be formed except for `k`. Therefore, the program may not always produce a valid sequence `a` for all possible inputs `n` and `k`.
