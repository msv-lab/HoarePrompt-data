### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads `n` (number of problems), `m` (number of rounds), and the string `a` representing the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: The program initializes a list `count` of size 7 (to represent the 7 difficulty levels 'A' to 'G'). It then iterates through the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in the `count` list based on the difficulty level of each problem. This is done using the formula `ord(char) - ord('A')` which correctly maps 'A' to 0, 'B' to 1, ..., and 'G' to 6.

3. **Calculating Needed Problems**: The program then calculates the number of additional problems needed. It iterates through the `count` list and for each difficulty level, if the count is less than `m` (the number of rounds), it adds the difference `(m - count[i])` to the `needed_problems` variable. This ensures that for each round, there is at least one problem of each difficulty level.

4. **Output**: The program prints the `needed_problems` for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case as per the problem description. It handles the input and output requirements appropriately and performs the necessary calculations accurately.
