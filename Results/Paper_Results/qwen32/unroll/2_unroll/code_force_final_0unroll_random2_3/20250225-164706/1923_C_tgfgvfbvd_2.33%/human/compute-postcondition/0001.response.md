Output State: **For each test case, the code will output 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on whether the sum of the subarray from index l_i to r_i is at least twice the length of the subarray. The variables n, m, l, p, and c will not retain their values after the loop finishes as they are reinitialized for each test case. The variable t, which represents the number of test cases, will be decremented to 0 after all test cases have been processed.**
