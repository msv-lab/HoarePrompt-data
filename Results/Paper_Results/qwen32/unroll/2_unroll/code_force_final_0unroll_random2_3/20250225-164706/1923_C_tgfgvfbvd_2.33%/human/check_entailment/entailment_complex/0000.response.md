### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine if a given subarray of the array `c` is "good" based on the criteria described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the prefix sum array `p` where `p[i]` is the sum of the first `i+1` elements of the array `c`.
   - This allows for efficient calculation of the sum of any subarray `c[l_i ... r_i]` using the formula `p[r_i - 1] - p[l_i - 2]` (with a special case when `l_i` is 1).

2. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program calculates the sum `s` of the subarray `c[l_i ... r_i]` using the prefix sum array.
   - It then checks if the sum `s` is at least twice the length of the subarray, i.e., `s >= 2 * (r_i - l_i + 1)`.
   - If the condition is satisfied, it prints "YES", otherwise "NO".

3. **Correctness of the Condition**:
   - The condition `s >= 2 * (r_i - l_i + 1)` ensures that the sum of the subarray is large enough to be split into two different positive integer arrays `a` and `b` such that the sum of `a` equals the sum of `b` and all elements of `b` are positive.
   - If the sum of the subarray is at least twice its length, it is possible to construct such arrays `a` and `b` by assigning some elements of the subarray to `a` and the rest to `b` in such a way that all elements of `b` remain positive and different from the corresponding elements of `a`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when the subarray length is 1. In such cases, the sum cannot be at least twice the length of the subarray, so the program correctly outputs "NO".

### Conclusion:
The logic of the program correctly determines if a subarray is "good" based on the given criteria. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
