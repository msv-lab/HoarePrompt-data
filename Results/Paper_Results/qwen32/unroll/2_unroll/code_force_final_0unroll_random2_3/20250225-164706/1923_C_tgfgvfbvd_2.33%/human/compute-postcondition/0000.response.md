The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which does not represent a variable that can be adjusted. The loop will iterate based on the value of `t` which is the number of test cases. Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
