To determine the output state, let's break down the loop and understand its behavior:

1. The loop runs from `i = n` down to `i = 1` (inclusive).
2. In each iteration, it prints a formatted string `? 1 {i * n}`.
3. It then calls `func_2()` and assigns the returned value to `v`.
4. If `v` equals `n`, it sets `v` to the current value of `i` and breaks out of the loop.

The loop will terminate under two conditions:
- If `v` equals `n` at any point during the loop, the loop breaks, and `v` is set to the current value of `i`.
- If the loop completes all iterations without `v` ever equaling `n`, the final value of `v` will be the value it was assigned in the last iteration (which is 1, as it is initialized).

Since the problem does not specify the behavior of `func_2()`, we need to consider the two possible scenarios:
- If `func_2()` returns `n` at any point, `v` will be set to the corresponding `i` value and the loop will terminate early.
- If `func_2()` never returns `n`, the loop will run to completion and `v` will remain 1.

Given the initial state and the loop behavior, the output state will be:
- `v` will either be the value of `i` when `func_2()` returns `n`, or it will be 1 if `func_2()` never returns `n`.
- `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the loop.

Thus, the output state can be described as:
Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, and `k` satisfies 1 <= `k` <= `n`; `v` is either the value of `i` when `func_2()` returns `n`, or 1 if `func_2()` never returns `n`.**
