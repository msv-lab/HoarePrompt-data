To determine the state required for the `for` loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `i`, `n`, and `k`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n // k + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, the range must contain at least one integer.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Range Analysis**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n // k`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n // k` must be at least 1. This means `n // k + 1` must be greater than 1.
   - Therefore, `n // k` must be at least 1, which implies `n >= k`.

2. **Initial Values of `n` and `k`**:
   - We know that `k` satisfies `1 <= k <= n`.
   - To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least `k`.

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Given that `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, and `k` satisfies `1 <= k <= n`, we need to ensure that `n >= k` to make the loop execute.
   - The value of `v` (which is either `i` when `func_2()` returns `n`, or 1 if `func_2()` never returns `n`) does not affect the loop execution directly as it is not part of the loop head.

Based on this analysis, the state should be adjusted to ensure `n >= k`. Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`**.
