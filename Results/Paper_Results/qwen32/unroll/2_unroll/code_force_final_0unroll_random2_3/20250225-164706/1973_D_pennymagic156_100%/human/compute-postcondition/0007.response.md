To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of calling `func_2()` on the variables `i`, `cnt`, `l`, and `v`. However, the function `func_2()` is not defined in the provided context, so we can only make assumptions based on the description given.

Given:
- `i` is the value that caused the loop to exit.
- `cnt` is 0.
- `l` is `n + 1`.
- `v` is either the value of `i` when `func_2()` returns `n`, or `1` if `func_2()` never returns `n`.

Since `func_2()` is not defined, we can only consider the two possible outcomes described:
1. `func_2()` returns `n`, and `v` becomes the value of `i` when this happens.
2. `func_2()` never returns `n`, and `v` remains `1`.

However, without the definition of `func_2()`, we cannot determine if it returns `n` or not, and we cannot determine the specific value of `i` when `func_2()` returns `n`. Therefore, we will consider both possibilities in the output state.

Output State: **`i` is the value that caused the loop to exit, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `n + 1`, `v` is either the value of `i` when `func_2()` returns `n`, or `1` if `func_2()` never returns `n`.**

In simpler terms, the values of `i`, `cnt`, and `l` remain unchanged. The value of `v` depends on whether `func_2()` returns `n` or not.
