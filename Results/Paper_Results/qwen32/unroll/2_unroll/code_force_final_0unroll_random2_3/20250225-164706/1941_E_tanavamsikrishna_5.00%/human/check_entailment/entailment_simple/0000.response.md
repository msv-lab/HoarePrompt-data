### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is intended to solve the problem of minimizing the total cost of installing supports for bridges over a river grid, adhering to the constraints provided.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function calculates the cost of installing supports in a single row of the river grid.
- It starts by incrementing the first `d-1` elements of the row by 1.
- Then, for each subsequent element in the row, it calculates the cost by adding the original depth of that cell, 1, and the minimum cost of the previous `d` elements.
- The function returns the cost of the last element in the row, which represents the total cost of installing supports for that row under the given constraints.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function handles the overall logic for multiple test cases.
- It reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
- It constructs the grid of river depths (`rows`).
- It computes the cost of installing supports for each row using `func_1` and stores these costs in the `costs` list.
- It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows by summing the corresponding elements in `costs`.
- Finally, it prints the minimum total cost found among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

### Analysis:
- The function `func_1` correctly computes the minimum cost for installing supports in a single row according to the problem's constraints.
- The function `func_2` correctly computes the minimum total cost for installing supports across `k` consecutive rows by considering all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows and selecting the one with the minimum total cost.
- The program handles multiple test cases by calling `func_2` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem as described. The given annotations and the logic within the functions align with the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
