Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the annotations to ensure that the logic and implementation are correct for the given problem description.

### Problem Recap
- **Objective**: Build `k` bridges over consecutive rows of a grid representing a river, with supports installed according to specific rules.
- **Constraints**:
  - Supports must be installed in the first and last columns.
  - The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
  - The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i, j} + 1`.
- **Goal**: Minimize the total cost of installing supports for all `k` bridges.

### Program Analysis

#### Function `func_1(row: List[int], d: int)`
- **Purpose**: Calculate the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row.
- **Logic**:
  1. **Initialization**: The first `d-1` supports are installed at the beginning of the row, and their costs are calculated as `a_{i, j} + 1`.
  2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: For each subsequent cell, it calculates the minimum cost by considering the minimum cost of placing a support within the previous `d` cells (excluding the current cell) and adds the cost of placing a support in the current cell, which is `a_{i, j} + 1`.

- **Annotations**:
  - The first `d-1` elements are incremented by 1.
  - Each subsequent element is the sum of its original value, the minimum value in the preceding `d` elements, and 1.
  - The function returns the last element of the modified list, which is the minimum cost for the entire row.

- **Issues**:
  - The current implementation in `func_1` does not correctly account for the requirement that a support must be installed in the last column. The cost calculation should ensure that the last column is always included in the support installation.
  - The logic for calculating the minimum cost using dynamic programming is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly handle the requirement that the distance between supports must be no more than `d`.

#### Function `func_2()`
- **Purpose**: Handle multiple test cases, calculate the cost for each row using `func_1`, and find the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.
- **Logic**:
  1. **Input Reading**: Reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
  2. **Cost Calculation**: For each row in the grid, it calculates the cost of installing supports using `func_1`.
  3. **Total Cost Calculation**: It calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and stores these costs in `total_costs`.
  4. **Output**: Prints the minimum total cost from `total_costs`.

- **Annotations**:
  - The function reads input values including the number of rows (`n`), number of columns (`m`), number of bridges (`k`), maximum distance between supports (`d`), a 2D list of integers (`rows`), and calculates the cost of installing supports for each row using `func_1`.
  - It then computes the sum of costs for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum of these sums.

- **Issues**:
  - The reliance on `func_1` means that the issues in `func_1` propagate to `func_2`.
  - The calculation of total costs and the selection of the minimum cost are correct if `func_1` were correct.

### Correctness Evaluation
Given the issues identified in `func_1`, the overall program is not correct. The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` does not correctly account for the requirement that supports must be installed in the last column and that the distance between supports must be no more than `d`.

### Final Evaluation
The original assessment is inaccurate due to the issues in `func_1`.

**Final: False**
