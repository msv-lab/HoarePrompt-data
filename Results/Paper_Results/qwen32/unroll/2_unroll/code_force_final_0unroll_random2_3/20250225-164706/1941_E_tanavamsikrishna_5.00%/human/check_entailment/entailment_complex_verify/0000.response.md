### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies significant issues in the provided code. Let's break down the problems and verify them step-by-step using the annotated code and the problem description.

#### Issues in `func_1`:

The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the cost of installing supports in a single row while ensuring the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`. However, the current implementation does not achieve this:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Support Costs**:
   - The function simply adds 1 to each cell and then uses a sliding window to determine the minimum cost, which does not align with the problem's constraints.
   - It does not ensure that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`. Instead, it assumes that the cost for each cell is just the depth plus 1 and then computes the cumulative cost, which is incorrect.

The annotations confirm that `func_1` modifies the list by adding 1 to each cell and then using a sliding window to determine the minimum cost, but this is not the correct approach as it does not respect the distance constraint `d`.

#### Issues in `func_2`:

The function `func_2` is intended to calculate the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows. However, the current implementation does not achieve this:

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation for Multiple Bridges**:
   - The function calculates the cost for each row independently using `func_1` and then sums these costs for `k` consecutive rows to find the minimum total cost.
   - This approach does not consider the constraints on the distance `d` between supports across multiple rows. It assumes that the cost for each row can be calculated independently, which is incorrect.

The annotations confirm that `func_2` calculates the cost for each row independently and then sums these costs for `k` consecutive rows, but this is not the correct approach as it does not respect the distance constraint `d` across multiple rows.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, we need to:

1. For each row, determine the minimum cost to place supports such that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
2. Use dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the minimum cost for placing supports across `k` consecutive rows while respecting the distance constraint `d`.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following test case:
```
1
4 5 2 2
0 1 1 1 0
0 2 2 2 0
0 2 1 1 0
0 3 2 1 0
```
- The correct minimum cost for building 2 bridges with `d=2` should be `8` (as per the problem statement example).
- The provided code will not produce the correct result because it does not correctly handle the placement of supports with the distance constraint `d` across multiple rows.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost of installing supports for a row, and `func_2` fails to handle the problem constraints properly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
