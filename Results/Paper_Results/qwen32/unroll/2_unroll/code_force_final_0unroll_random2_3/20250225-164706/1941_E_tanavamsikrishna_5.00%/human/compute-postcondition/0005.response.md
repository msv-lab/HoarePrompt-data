To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's break down the loop and see what it does.

The loop iterates over the `costs` list, summing up `k` consecutive elements at a time, and appending each sum to the `total_costs` list. The loop runs for `len(costs) - (k - 1)` iterations because the last `k` elements need to be considered as the final sum.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n`, `m`, `k`, `d` remain unchanged.
   - `rows` remains unchanged.
   - `costs` remains unchanged.
   - `total_costs` is initialized as an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For `i` ranging from `0` to `len(costs) - k` (inclusive), the loop calculates the sum of `k` consecutive elements starting from index `i` in the `costs` list.
   - This sum is then appended to the `total_costs` list.

3. **Final State**:
   - `total_costs` will contain the sums of all possible `k`-length sublists of `costs`.

The output state after the loop finishes executing will be:

Output State: **n is the first input integer, m is the second input integer, k is the third input integer, d is the fourth input integer, rows is a 2D list of integers where each sublist (row) contains m integers read from the input, costs is a list of integers where each integer is the result of func_1(row, d) for the corresponding row in rows, total_costs is a list of integers where each integer is the sum of k consecutive elements from the costs list.**
