Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, and `costs`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of rows, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of columns, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of bridges, `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports, `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid and contains `m` integers, and `costs` is a list of integers representing the cost of installing supports for each row. The function returns a value based on the constraints provided, which could involve calculating the minimum cost to install supports within the given maximum distance `d` while considering the number of bridges `k` and the costs for each row.**
