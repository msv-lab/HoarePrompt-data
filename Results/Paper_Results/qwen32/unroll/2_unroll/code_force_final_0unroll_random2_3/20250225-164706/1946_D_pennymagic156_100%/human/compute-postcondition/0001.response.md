The code snippet provided reassigns the variable `a` to the value returned by the function `func_1()`. This means that the original value of `a` is no longer relevant, as it has been overwritten. The values of `n` and `x`, which were initially assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`. The length of the array `a` is still a positive integer, and each integer in `a` is still less than 2^30, but `a` now holds the value returned by `func_1()`.**
