You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

    return max(ans, len(a))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function calculates and returns the maximum value between the count of elements that can be XORed to zero at any bit position and the length of the list `a`, which is left empty after the function's execution.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code attempts to solve the problem by iterating over each bit position from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB) and making decisions based on the XOR and OR operations. However, the logic seems flawed and does not correctly implement the required conditions.

### Key Issues:
1. **Logic for Bitwise Operations**: The code seems to be trying to handle the constraints by examining each bit position, but the logic for determining the maximum number of segments (`k`) based on the bitwise XOR and OR operations is incorrect. The code does not correctly ensure that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of the segments is less than or equal to `x`.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The code does not handle some edge cases correctly. For example, if `x` is `0`, the only valid segment would be the entire array if the XOR of the entire array is `0`. The code does not handle this correctly.

3. **Incorrect Return Values**: The code can return incorrect values for certain inputs. For example, the code might return `-1` when a valid segmentation exists, or it might return a value greater than the actual maximum number of segments.

### Example of a Case Where the Code Fails:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 0
0 0 1
```
The correct output should be `1` because the only valid segment is the entire array `[0, 0, 1]` since `0 ^ 0 ^ 1 = 1` which is not less than or equal to `0`. However, the code might incorrectly handle this case and return a different value.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description, and there are cases where it fails to produce the correct output. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
