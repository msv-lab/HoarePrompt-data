Output State: **`n` and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`. The length of the array `a` is still a positive integer, and each integer in `a` is still less than 2^30.**

In simpler terms, the values of `n` and `x` are updated to whatever values are returned by the function `func_3()`, while the properties of the array `a` remain unchanged.
