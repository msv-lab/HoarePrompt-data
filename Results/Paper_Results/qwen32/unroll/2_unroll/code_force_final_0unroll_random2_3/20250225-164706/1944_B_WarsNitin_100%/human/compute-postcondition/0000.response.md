Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50,000, and k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The array a is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 50,000.**

In simple terms, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of an integer input by the user, which is between 1 and 5000 inclusive. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
