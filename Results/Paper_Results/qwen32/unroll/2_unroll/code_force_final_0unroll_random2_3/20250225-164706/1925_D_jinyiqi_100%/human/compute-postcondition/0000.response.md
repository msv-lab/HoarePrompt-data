The code provided only reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer `t` is presumably the number of test cases that will follow. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a_i`, `b_i`, `f_i`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values and conditions remain the same.

Output State: **Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5. The next m lines contain three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i, where a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. All pairs (a_i, b_i) are distinct. The sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `t` is an input integer.**
