### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to carefully analyze the problem statement and the logic implemented in the code.

#### Problem Breakdown:

1. **Inputs:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of children.
     - `m`: Number of friendship pairs.
     - `k`: Number of excursions.
     - `m` lines of three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, `f_i` representing the friendship pairs and their initial friendship values.

2. **Objective:**
   - Compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - The result should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where `p` and `q` are coprime, and the output should be \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7)\).

#### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads `m` lines, each containing `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the sum of initial friendship values (`sum_f`).

3. **Combinatorial Calculations:**
   - `cn2` is calculated as \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), representing the number of possible pairs of children.
   - `p` and `q` are calculated as follows:
     - \( p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \text{cn2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1) \)
     - \( q = 2 \cdot \text{cn2}^2 \)

4. **Simplification and Modular Inverse:**
   - The program simplifies the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (`gcd`).
   - It then computes the modular inverse of `q` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and multiplies it with `p`, taking the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Verification:

- The formula for `p` and `q` seems to be derived from the expected value calculation for the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions.
- The program correctly handles the modular arithmetic required to produce the final result.

However, there is a potential issue with the formula for `p` and `q`. The formula used in the code does not accurately reflect the expected value calculation for the problem. The expected value calculation involves the probability of selecting a friend pair and the increase in their friendship value over `k` excursions, which is more complex than the formula provided in the code.

#### Correct Formula:

The expected value calculation should consider the probability of selecting a friend pair and the expected increase in their friendship value over `k` excursions. The correct formula for `p` and `q` should be derived based on these probabilities.

Given the discrepancy between the provided formula and the correct expected value calculation, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **False**
