The given code snippet only initializes a variable `M` with the value `10 ** 9 + 7`. This value is a common modulus used in competitive programming to prevent integer overflow. None of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a_i`, `b_i`, `f_i`, `t`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **Each test case consists of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ `m` ≤ min(10^5, `n`(`n`-1)/2), and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2 · 10^5. The next `m` lines contain three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, where `a_i` ≠ `b_i`, 1 ≤ `a_i`, `b_i` ≤ `n`, and 1 ≤ `f_i` ≤ 10^9. All pairs (`a_i`, `b_i`) are distinct. The sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `k` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `t` is an input integer. `M` is 10 ** 9 + 7.**
