### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not correctly implement the expected value calculation for the problem. Let's break down why the program is incorrect based on the problem description and the annotations.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
- For each excursion, if a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1.
- The result should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) in its simplest form, and we need to output \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

#### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It correctly calculates the sum of initial friendship values (`sum_f`).
   - It computes the total number of possible pairs (`cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2`).

2. **Calculation of `p` and `q`**:
   - The program uses the formula:
     \[
     p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)
     \]
     \[
     q = 2 * cn2 ** 2
     \]
   - However, this formula does not correctly account for the expected increase in friendship values over multiple excursions.

3. **Simplification and Output**:
   - The program simplifies the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (`gcd`).
   - It calculates \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\) and prints the result.

#### Correct Approach:
- The expected value calculation involves considering the probability of picking a friend pair and the probability of picking a non-friend pair.
- For each friend pair, the expected contribution to the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions can be calculated using the formula for the expected value of a random variable.
- The correct approach involves using combinatorial mathematics to compute the expected sum of friendship values.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the expected value calculation as described in the problem statement. The formula used for `p` and `q` is incorrect and does not account for the increase in friendship values over multiple excursions.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the provided program is incorrect. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
