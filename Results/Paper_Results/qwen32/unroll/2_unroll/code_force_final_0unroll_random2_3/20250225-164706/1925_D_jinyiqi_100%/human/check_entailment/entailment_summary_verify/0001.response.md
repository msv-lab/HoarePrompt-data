### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem statement to determine if the program correctly implements the required solution.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Objective**: Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
- **Constraints**:
  - `n` children, `m` pairs of friends with initial friendship values, `k` excursions.
  - Each excursion randomly picks a pair of children.
  - If the pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for subsequent excursions.
  - The expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) in its simplest form, and we need to output \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program calculates `p` and `q` using the following formulas:
- `p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`
- `q = 2 * cn2 ** 2`

Where:
- `cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2` is the total number of possible pairs of children.
- `sum_f` is the sum of initial friendship values of all friend pairs.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
The formulas used in the program do not correctly represent the expected value calculation. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Probability of Picking a Friend Pair**:
   - The probability of picking a specific friend pair in one excursion is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{m}{cn2}\).
   - The expected number of times a specific friend pair is chosen in `k` excursions is \(k \cdot \frac{m}{cn2}\).

2. **Expected Friendship Value Contribution**:
   - For a specific friend pair with initial friendship value `f`, the expected contribution to the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions is more complex.
   - It involves summing the expected values of the friendship values for each possible number of times the pair is chosen.

3. **Formula Derivation**:
   - The correct formula for the expected sum of friendship values involves combinatorial mathematics and is not simply a linear combination of `k`, `m`, and `sum_f`.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the expected value calculation as described in the problem statement. The formulas used do not account for the probabilistic nature of the problem and the cumulative increase in friendship values over multiple excursions.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem.

**Final: False**
