### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to understand if it correctly computes the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - Number of children `n`
   - Number of friend pairs `m`
   - Number of excursions `k`
   - For each friend pair `(a_i, b_i)`, a friendship value `f_i`

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions, expressed as `p * q^-1 % (10^9 + 7)`, where `p/q` is the fraction representing the expected value in its simplest form.

3. **Key Points:**
   - Each excursion, a pair of children is chosen uniformly at random.
   - If the chosen pair is a friend pair, their friendship value increases by 1 for subsequent excursions.
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions needs to be computed.

#### Provided Solution Analysis:
The solution provided attempts to compute the expected value using a specific formula. Let's analyze the formula and the implementation:

1. **Combinatorial Calculations:**
   - `cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2` computes the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n`, which is the total number of possible pairs.
   - `sum_f` is the sum of all initial friendship values.

2. **Formula for `p` and `q`:**
   - The numerator `p` is calculated as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`.
   - The denominator `q` is calculated as `2 * cn2 ** 2`.

3. **Simplification and Modular Inverse:**
   - The fraction `p/q` is simplified by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - The result is computed as `p * q^-1 % (10^9 + 7)`, where `q^-1` is the modular inverse of `q` modulo `10^9 + 7`.

#### Verification:
The provided solution seems to be attempting to compute the expected value based on some combinatorial and probabilistic reasoning. However, the formula used for `p` and `q` does not directly correspond to the expected value calculation for the problem as described.

The expected value calculation should involve considering the probability of each pair being chosen and the incremental increase in friendship values. The provided formula seems to be an incorrect simplification or misinterpretation of the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the solution is **False**.

**Correctness: False**
