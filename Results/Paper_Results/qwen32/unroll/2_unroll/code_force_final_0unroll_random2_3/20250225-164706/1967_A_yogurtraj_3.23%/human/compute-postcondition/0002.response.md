Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of elements in a list, a non-negative integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function processes each test case based on the values of `n`, `k`, and `a`, and returns a result for each test case.**
