The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, a non-negative integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific result based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the sorted list `a`. The result is derived by distributing the value `k` across the elements of the list in a particular manner and then computing a final value that is printed.
