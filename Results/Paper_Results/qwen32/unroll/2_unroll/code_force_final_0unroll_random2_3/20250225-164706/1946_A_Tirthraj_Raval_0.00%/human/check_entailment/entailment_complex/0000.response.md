Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The program sorts the array and prints the count of the median element, which does not address the problem's requirement of increasing the median with the minimum number of operations.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Sort the array.
2. Identify the median.
3. Determine the minimum number of increments needed to ensure the median increases. This involves incrementing the smallest elements up to and including the median until the median value itself increases.

The current logic in the program simply counts the occurrences of the median element, which is not related to the number of operations needed to increase the median.

Thus, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
