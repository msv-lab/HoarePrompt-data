Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not properly account for the price increase mechanism. The program simply sorts the prices and buys the minimum of `m` or `k` tickets each day without considering the cumulative price increase on subsequent days. This can lead to suboptimal solutions where the total cost is higher than necessary.

To solve this problem correctly, one could use a dynamic programming approach or a greedy strategy that takes into account the price increase for subsequent days. The program needs to be modified to consider the cumulative effect of buying tickets on the prices of future days.
