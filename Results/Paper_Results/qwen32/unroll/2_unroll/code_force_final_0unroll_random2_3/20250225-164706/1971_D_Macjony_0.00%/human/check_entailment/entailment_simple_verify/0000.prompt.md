You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):

        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:

                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description.

The task is to determine the minimum number of pieces required to cut a binary string into such that the pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string. The sorted binary string should have all '0's before all '1's.

The given program works by iterating through the binary string and counting the transitions from '0' to '1'. It increments the count each time it encounters a transition from '0' to '1'. However, it also includes an additional decrement of the count if at least one '0' to '1' transition is found. This decrement step seems unnecessary and incorrect.

Let's consider some edge cases and examples:

1. **Example 1: "11010"**
   - The program will count transitions from '0' to '1' which are at positions 2 and 3.
   - The count will be incremented twice, making it 3.
   - The flag will be set to True because there is at least one '0' to '1' transition.
   - The count will then be decremented by 1, making it 2. However, the correct answer is 3.
   
2. **Example 2: "00000000"**
   - There are no transitions, so the count remains 1.
   - The flag remains False, so no decrement happens.
   - The count is 1, which is correct.
   
3. **Example 3: "1"**
   - There are no transitions, so the count remains 1.
   - The flag remains False, so no decrement happens.
   - The count is 1, which is correct.
   
4. **Example 4: "10"**
   - There is one transition from '1' to '0'.
   - The count is incremented once, making it 2.
   - The flag is not set to True because the transition is from '1' to '0', not '0' to '1'.
   - The count remains 2, which is correct.
   
5. **Example 5: "0001111"**
   - There is one transition from '0' to '1'.
   - The count is incremented once, making it 2.
   - The flag is set to True because there is at least one '0' to '1' transition.
   - The count is decremented by 1, making it 1, which is correct.
   
6. **Example 6: "0110"**
   - There are two transitions: one from '0' to '1' and one from '1' to '0'.
   - The count is incremented twice, making it 3.
   - The flag is set to True because there is at least one '0' to '1' transition.
   - The count is decremented by 1, making it 2, which is correct.

The program seems to incorrectly decrement the count in some cases, leading to incorrect results. Specifically, the decrement step is unnecessary and incorrect for the first example ("11010").

**Correctness: False**

Explanation: The program incorrectly decrements the count if there is at least one '0' to '1' transition, which can lead to incorrect results in some cases, as demonstrated by the first example "11010". The decrement step is unnecessary and should be removed.
