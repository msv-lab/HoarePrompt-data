The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is already an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. However, after executing this line, `t` will be reassigned to the new integer input value. The variable `s` and its properties remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the new integer input value (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500); `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.**
