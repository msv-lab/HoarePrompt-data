You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: Prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each of the n test cases, with t and a unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the transformation and sorting logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it does not properly transform and check the array elements to determine if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
10 3 20 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- The array is `[10, 3, 20, 1]`.
- We can split `10` into `1` and `0`, resulting in `[1, 0, 3, 20, 1]`.
- We can split `20` into `2` and `0`, resulting in `[1, 0, 3, 2, 0, 1]`.
- No matter how we split the numbers, it is impossible to sort the array in non-decreasing order because the `1` at the end will always be out of place.

**Program Output:**
The program will likely output `YES` for this input, which is incorrect.

The main issue in the program is that it does not correctly simulate the transformation process and check if the resulting array can be sorted. The logic of checking only the immediate previous element and its split is not sufficient to determine if the entire array can be sorted after any number of transformations.

To correctly solve the problem, a more comprehensive approach is needed, such as recursively splitting the numbers and checking if the resulting array can be sorted.
