The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `n`. Since the loop iterates `n` times, the value of `n` is crucial for determining whether the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need any specific state adjustment. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. However, according to the problem statement, `n` is provided by the input and satisfies `2 <= n <= 50`.

Given that the loop will execute as long as `n` is within the specified range, there is no need to adjust `n` or `_`. The state of `t` and `a` does not affect the execution of the loop, so they remain as they are.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an integer provided by the input (2 <= n <= 50); `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99**
