Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to determine if it is possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order by applying the given operation any number of times. However, there is a logical flaw in the implementation. The program checks if the current element is less than the previous one, and if so, it attempts to split the previous element and check if the resulting list is sorted. This approach is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order through the given operation.

The key issue is that the program does not fully simulate the process of splitting elements and reordering the array. It only checks if splitting the previous element and appending the current element results in a sorted list, which is not a comprehensive check. The program should simulate the process of splitting elements and check if the entire array can be sorted, not just局部 changes.

For example, consider the test case `12 28 5`. The program will check if splitting `28` and appending `5` results in a sorted list, but it does not consider other possible splits or the overall order of the array. In this case, the correct approach would be to split `28` into `2` and `8` and check if the array `[12, 2, 8, 5]` can be sorted, which it cannot.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
