To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's analyze the given loop and the initial state:

### Initial State:
- `t` is the same as `int(data[0])`
- `n` is the value from the last test case
- `s` is the string from the last test case
- `index` is `1 + 2*t`
- `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the number of 'U' characters in each test case string.

### Loop Code:
```python
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list.
- For each iteration, it prints the current `result` which is either 'YES' or 'NO'.
- This loop does not modify any of the variables `t`, `n`, `s`, or `index`. It only prints the elements of the `results` list.

### Output State:
- The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `index` remain unchanged.
- The `results` list remains unchanged as well, but its elements will be printed to the console.

### Human-readable Output State:
The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `results` list will have been printed to the console, with each element ('YES' or 'NO') printed on a new line. The variables `t`, `n`, `s`, and `index` will retain their initial values.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`t` is the same as `int(data[0])`, `n` is the value from the last test case, `s` is the string from the last test case, `index` is `1 + 2*t`, `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the number of 'U' characters in each test case string. The elements of `results` have been printed.**
