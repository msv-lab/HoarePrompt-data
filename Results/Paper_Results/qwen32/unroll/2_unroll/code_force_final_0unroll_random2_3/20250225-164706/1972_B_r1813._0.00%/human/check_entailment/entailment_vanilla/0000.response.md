Reasoning:
The problem revolves around determining the winner of a game based on the initial configuration of coins. The key observation is that the game's outcome is solely dependent on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins ("U") in the initial configuration.

Here's the reasoning step-by-step:
1. Each player removes a facing-up coin and flips the adjacent coins.
2. The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins left.
3. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice (who goes first) can always ensure that she leaves an even number of facing-up coins for Bob. This strategy guarantees that Alice will always have a move when Bob cannot, thus leading to Alice's win.
4. Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always ensure that he leaves an odd number of facing-up coins for Alice, leading to Bob's win.

The given program implements this logic correctly:
- It reads the input values for the number of test cases and the configurations of coins.
- For each configuration, it counts the number of facing-up coins.
- It checks if the count of facing-up coins is odd or even.
- It appends "YES" to the results list if the count is odd (indicating Alice's win) and "NO" if the count is even (indicating Bob's win).
- Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

Thus, the program correctly determines the winner based on the initial configuration of coins.

Correctness: **True**
