The only variable in the loop head is `times`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `times`. If `times` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variables `t` and `check` do not affect the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `times` must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `times` must be greater than or equal to 1; `check` is 2147483647**
