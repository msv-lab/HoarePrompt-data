To determine if the given Python program is correct, we need to verify that it correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required to place the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons on the 5x3 grid screens.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` (number of 1x1 icons) and `b` (number of 2x2 icons).

2. **Handling 2x2 Icons:**
   - Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. Since each screen is a 5x3 grid (15 cells), the number of screens required just to accommodate the 2x2 icons is calculated by `t = b // 2`. If `b` is odd, an additional screen is needed, so `t = b // 2 + 1`.

3. **Remaining Space for 1x1 Icons:**
   - After placing the 2x2 icons, the remaining space on the screens is calculated as `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, it means the 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining space without needing additional screens.
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, the program calculates the number of additional screens required for the 1x1 icons. This is done by first calculating the number of additional cells needed (`t2 = a - t1`), and then determining how many full screens are needed to accommodate these cells (`t = t + t2 // 15`). If there are leftover cells that do not fill a full screen, an additional screen is added (`t = t + t2 // 15 + 1`).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of screens `t` required for each test case.

### Verification with Test Cases:

Let's verify the program with the provided test cases:

- **Test Case 1: (1, 1)**
  - 1 2x2 icon requires 1 screen.
  - Remaining space: 15 - 4 = 11 cells.
  - 1 1x1 icon can fit in the remaining space.
  - Output: 1

- **Test Case 2: (7, 2)**
  - 2 2x2 icons require 1 screen.
  - Remaining space: 15 - 8 = 7 cells.
  - 7 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining space.
  - Output: 1

- **Test Case 3: (12, 4)**
  - 4 2x2 icons require 2 screens.
  - Remaining space: 30 - 16 = 14 cells.
  - 12 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining space.
  - Output: 2

- **Test Case 4: (0, 3)**
  - 3 2x2 icons require 2 screens.
  - Output: 2

- **Test Case 5: (1, 0)**
  - 1 1x1 icon requires 1 screen.
  - Output: 1

- **Test Case 6: (8, 1)**
  - 1 2x2 icon requires 1 screen.
  - Remaining space: 15 - 4 = 11 cells.
  - 8 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining space.
  - Output: 1

- **Test Case 7: (0, 0)**
  - No icons require 0 screens.
  - Output: 0

- **Test Case 8: (2, 0)**
  - 2 1x1 icons require 1 screen.
  - Output: 1

- **Test Case 9: (15, 0)**
  - 15 1x1 icons require 1 screen.
  - Output: 1

- **Test Case 10: (8, 2)**
  - 2 2x2 icons require 1 screen.
  - Remaining space: 15 - 8 = 7 cells.
  - 8 1x1 icons cannot fit in the remaining space.
  - Additional screens needed: 8 - 7 = 1, requiring 1 more screen.
  - Output: 2

- **Test Case 11: (0, 9)**
  - 9 2x2 icons require 5 screens.
  - Output: 5

The output of the program matches the expected output for all the test cases.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
