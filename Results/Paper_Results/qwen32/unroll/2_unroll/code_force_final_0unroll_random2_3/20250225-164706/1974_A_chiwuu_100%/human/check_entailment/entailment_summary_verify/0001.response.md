### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step and compare it with the problem requirements and the function summary to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Grid Size**: Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means it has 15 cells.
2. **Icon Sizes**: 
   - 1x1 icons occupy 1 cell.
   - 2x2 icons occupy 4 cells.
3. **Constraints**:
   - A screen can hold a maximum of 3 2x2 icons (since 4 2x2 icons would require 16 cells).
   - The remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons are filled with 1x1 icons.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads `a` (number of 1x1 icons) and `b` (number of 2x2 icons).

2. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - `t = b` initializes `t` with the number of 2x2 icons.
   - The code then calculates the minimum number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons:
     - If `b` is even, `t = b // 2`.
     - If `b` is odd, `t = b // 2 + 1`.
   - This logic is incorrect because it assumes each screen can hold 2 2x2 icons, which is not true. Each screen can hold a maximum of 3 2x2 icons.

3. **Calculating Remaining Space**:
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` calculates the remaining space on the screens used for 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1 >= a`, no additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons.
   - Otherwise, `t2 = a - t1` calculates the number of 1x1 icons that still need to be placed.
   - The program then calculates the number of additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons:
     - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t = t + t2 // 15`.
     - Otherwise, `t = t + t2 // 15 + 1`.

#### Correct Logic:
1. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The correct calculation should be `screens_for_2x2 = (b + 2) // 3`, because each screen can hold a maximum of 3 2x2 icons.

2. **Calculating Remaining Space**:
   - `remaining_space = screens_for_2x2 * 15 - b * 4` calculates the remaining space on the screens used for 2x2 icons.
   - If `remaining_space >= a`, no additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons.
   - Otherwise, `additional_screens = (a - remaining_space + 14) // 15` calculates the number of additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons.

#### Correct Implementation:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        screens_for_2x2 = (b + 2) // 3  # Correct calculation for 2x2 icons
        remaining_space = screens_for_2x2 * 15 - b * 4
        if remaining_space >= a:
            total_screens = screens_for_2x2
        else:
            additional_screens = (a - remaining_space + 14) // 15  # Correct calculation for 1x1 icons
            total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens
        print(total_screens)

# Call the function to execute the program
func()
```

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed. The logic for calculating the number of screens for 2x2 icons and the remaining space is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

**False**

### Final: **False**
