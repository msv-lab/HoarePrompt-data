Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Grid Size:** Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which has a total of 15 cells.
2. **Icon Sizes:** There are two types of icons:
   - 1x1 icons, which occupy 1 cell.
   - 2x2 icons, which occupy 4 cells.
3. **Objective:** Place the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons on the minimum number of screens.

### Key Points:
- Prioritize placing 2x2 icons first because they occupy more space.
- After placing 2x2 icons, place the remaining 1x1 icons.
- Calculate the number of screens required based on the total number of cells occupied.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Reading the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, reading the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
3. Calculating the number of screens required for 2x2 icons.
4. Calculating the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons.
5. Calculating the number of additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons.
6. Printing the total number of screens for each test case.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons by dividing by 2 and rounding up. However, this is incorrect because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, not 2.
   - The correct calculation should be to divide the number of 2x2 icons by the number of 2x2 icons that can fit on a screen (which is 2, as a 5x3 grid can fit at most 2 non-overlapping 2x2 icons).

2. **Incorrect Calculation for Remaining Cells:**
   - After placing 2x2 icons, the program calculates the remaining cells incorrectly. It should subtract the total cells occupied by 2x2 icons from the total available cells and then check how many 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining space.

3. **Incorrect Calculation for Additional Screens:**
   - The program incorrectly calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. It should divide the remaining number of 1x1 icons by the total number of cells in a screen (15) and round up.

### Correct Approach:
1. Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons by dividing the number of 2x2 icons by 2 and rounding up.
2. Calculate the remaining number of cells after placing 2x2 icons.
3. Calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons by dividing the remaining number of 1x1 icons by 15 and rounding up.
4. Sum the screens needed for 2x2 icons and the additional screens needed for 1x1 icons.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the minimum number of screens required. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
