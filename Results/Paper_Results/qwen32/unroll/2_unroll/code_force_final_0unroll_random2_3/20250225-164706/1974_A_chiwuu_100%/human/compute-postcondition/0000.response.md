Output State: **The function receives an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99) where `x` is the number of 1x1 application icons and `y` is the number of 2x2 application icons. `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`.**

In simple terms, the variable `n` has been assigned the value of the first integer input, which represents the number of test cases. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`) remain as described in the initial state.
