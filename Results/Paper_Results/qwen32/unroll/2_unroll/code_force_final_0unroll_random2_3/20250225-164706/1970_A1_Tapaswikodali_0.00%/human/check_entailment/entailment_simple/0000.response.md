### Reasoning:

The program follows the steps outlined in the problem description to compute the balanced shuffle of a given balanced parentheses sequence. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program starts by initializing `balance` to 0 and an empty list `details`. `balance` is used to keep track of the balance of the parentheses sequence as we iterate through the string `s`. `details` is used to store tuples of the form `(balance, -i, char)` for each character in the string `s`.

2. **Building the `details` List**:
   - The program iterates over each character in the input string `s` using `enumerate`, which provides both the index `i` and the character `char`.
   - If the character is `'('`, it increments the `balance` by 1.
   - If the character is `')'`, it decrements the `balance` by 1.
   - It appends a tuple `(balance, -i, char)` to the `details` list. The `-i` is used to ensure that when sorting, ties in `balance` are broken by the position in decreasing order (as required by the problem statement).

3. **Sorting the `details` List**:
   - The program sorts the `details` list. This sorting is based on the first element of the tuple (`balance`), and in case of ties, it uses the second element (`-i`), which ensures the positions are sorted in decreasing order.
   - After sorting, the characters are extracted from the sorted tuples and joined to form the resulting string `result`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the resulting string `result`, which is the balanced shuffle of the input string `s`.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It accurately computes the prefix balance for each character, sorts the characters based on the specified criteria, and produces the correct balanced shuffle sequence. The use of `-i` ensures that ties in balance are resolved by position in decreasing order, which is crucial for the correct output.

Thus, the program is correct.
