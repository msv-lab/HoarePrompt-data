Functionality: **The function accepts a balanced parentheses string `s` and prints a new string formed by sorting the characters of `s` based on a tuple `(balance, -i, char)`, where `balance` is the net count of `'('` minus `')'` up to the character, `-i` is the negative index of the character, and `char` is the character itself.**
