Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes an integer `n`, an integer `m`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'. It constructs a new list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the direction specified by each character in `s`. It then calculates the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order and returns these products in their original order.**
