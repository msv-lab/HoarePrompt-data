Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5 and 1 <= m <= 10^4; a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^4; s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'; The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5; `b` is an empty list.**

In simple terms, the initial conditions for the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged. The only change is that a new variable `b` is introduced, and it is initialized as an empty list.
