Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` where `n` is the size of a set and `k` is a positive integer not exceeding `n`. The function returns the result of some computation for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
