Reasoning:
The provided Python program is intended to verify if a password meets the specified conditions for being considered strong. The key conditions are:
1. The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program reads multiple test cases, each with a password, and checks each password using the `func_1` function. Here's a breakdown of how `func_1` works:
- It separates digits and letters into two lists.
- It sorts both lists.
- It checks if the last digit is greater than any letter. If so, it returns `False` because digits should not come after letters.
- It constructs a new password by concatenating the sorted digits and letters.
- It compares this new password with the original password. If they match, it means the original password was already sorted correctly, and it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

However, there is a logical flaw in the `func_1` function. The condition `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:` is incorrect because it only checks the last digit against the first letter, and it does not ensure that no digit comes after any letter in the original password. Instead, it should ensure that there are no digits after any letter in the original password sequence.

A correct approach would be:
1. Traverse the password to ensure that all digits appear before any letter.
2. Check that digits are in non-decreasing order.
3. Check that letters are in non-decreasing order.

Given the current implementation, the program will incorrectly accept passwords where a letter is followed by a digit, as long as the digits and letters are individually sorted.

Thus, the program is not correct as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
