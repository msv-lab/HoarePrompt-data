In the given task, the loop iterates over the list `cases`, where each element of `cases` is a tuple containing the values `(n, m, k, a, b)`. To ensure that the loop executes, the list `cases` must contain at least one tuple. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are defined within each tuple, and their states are determined by the content of the tuple itself. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the state of the `cases` list to ensure it contains at least one valid tuple.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `cases` is a list containing at least one tuple (n, m, k, a, b) where n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, k is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= 2 * min(n, m), and a and b are lists of lengths n and m respectively, where each element in a and b is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive; `results` is an empty list.**
