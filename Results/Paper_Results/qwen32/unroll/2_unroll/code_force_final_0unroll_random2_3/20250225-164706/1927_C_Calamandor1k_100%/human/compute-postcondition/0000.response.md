The given Python code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. This operation does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. The variables `t`, `cases`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The only new variable introduced is `results`, which is an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each test case in the list 'cases' is a tuple containing three elements: (n, m, k) where n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, and k is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= 2 * min(n, m); the next two elements in each test case are lists 'a' and 'b' of lengths n and m respectively, where each element in 'a' and 'b' is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive; `results` is an empty list.**
