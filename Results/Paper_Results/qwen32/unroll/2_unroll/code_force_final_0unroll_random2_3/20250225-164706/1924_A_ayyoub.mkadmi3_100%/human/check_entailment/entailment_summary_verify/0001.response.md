### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in the string `s`.
- If not, we need to provide a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` (length of `s`).
   - It reads the string `s` which consists of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program calls `func_1(s, k, n)` to determine if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.

3. **Function `func_1` Summary:**
   - `func_1` processes the string `s` and returns a tuple `(b, s1, s2)`.
   - `b` is a boolean indicating if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`.
   - `s1` and `s2` are intermediate strings constructed during the processing.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - If `b` is `False`, the program attempts to find a character not in `s1` and constructs a string of length `n` using this character.
   - If `b` is `True`, it outputs 'Yes'.

#### Issues in the Program:
- The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It does not correctly determine if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.
- The condition `len(s1) >= n * k` is not a valid check for the problem.
- The approach of constructing `s1` and `s2` by removing characters from an alphabet set does not help in checking subsequences of length `n`.

#### Correct Approach:
- To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
  1. Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
  2. For each generated string, check if it is a subsequence of `s`.
  3. If any string is not a subsequence, output 'No' followed by that string.
  4. If all strings are subsequences, output 'Yes'.

#### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not accurately determine if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
