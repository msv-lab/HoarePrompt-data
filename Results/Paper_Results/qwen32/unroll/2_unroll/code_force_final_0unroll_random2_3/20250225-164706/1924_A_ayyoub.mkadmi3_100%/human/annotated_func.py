#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000. Additionally, the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
        
    #State: s1 is the same as the input string s, s2 contains characters from s that were the last remaining character in alphabet at any point, and alphabet is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets.
    r = len(s1) // k
    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #The program returns a tuple containing three elements: a boolean indicating if the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and the string `s2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a string `s` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and returns a tuple. The tuple contains a boolean indicating if the length of the processed string `s1` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from a calculated index, and a string `s2` that includes characters which were the last remaining in the set of allowed alphabets at any point during processing.
