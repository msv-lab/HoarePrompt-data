Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the string `s`. If not, we need to provide a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one as follows:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` (the length of the string `s`).
   - It reads the string `s` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It calls the function `func_1(s, k, n)` which is supposed to determine if all possible strings of length `n` can be subsequences of `s`.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return a tuple `(b, s1, s2)` where `b` is a boolean indicating if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences, and `s1` and `s2` are some intermediate strings.

3. **Determining the Output:**
   - If `b` is `False`, it means not all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences.
     - It attempts to find a character in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that is not in `s1` and constructs a string of length `n` using this character.
     - It appends 'No' and the constructed string to the output list.
   - If `b` is `True`, it appends 'Yes' to the output list.

4. **Output:**
   - It prints the results for each test case.

### Issues in the Program

The function `func_1` does not correctly determine if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`. The logic inside `func_1` is not aligned with the problem requirements.

- **Incorrect Logic:**
  - The function `func_1` attempts to build `s1` and `s2` by removing characters from an alphabet set, but this does not help in checking subsequences of length `n`.
  - The condition `len(s1) >= n * k` is not a valid check for the problem.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:

1. Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. For each generated string, check if it is a subsequence of `s`.
3. If any string is not a subsequence, print 'No' followed by that string.
4. If all strings are subsequences, print 'Yes'.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
