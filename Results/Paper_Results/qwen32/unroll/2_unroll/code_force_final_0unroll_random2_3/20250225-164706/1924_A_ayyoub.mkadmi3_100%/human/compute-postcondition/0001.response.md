Output State: **`s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 1000; `s1` is an empty string; `s2` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The variable `s2` is initialized as an empty string. The values of `s`, `s1`, and the constraints on `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged.
