Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Logic Error in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine if all possible strings of length `n` can be formed as subsequences of `s`. However, the current implementation does not correctly check for all possible subsequences.
   - The current logic in `func_1` only checks if a particular sequence of characters from `s` can be rearranged to form a sequence of length `n` using the first `k` letters, but it does not account for all possible subsequences of length `n`.

2. **Generating the Missing Subsequence**:
   - If the answer is `NO`, the program is supposed to print a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence of `s`. The current logic in the program does not correctly generate such a string.
   - The current logic simply finds the first character from the first `k` letters that is not in `s1` and repeats it `n` times, which does not guarantee that this string is not a subsequence of `s`.

3. **Case Sensitivity for Output**:
   - The problem description allows for any case for `YES` or `NO`, but the output should match the case used in the example output. The program currently uses lowercase `no` and `yes`, which is not consistent with the example output.

4. **Efficiency Concerns**:
   - The program does not handle the constraints efficiently. For example, it uses a set to store the alphabet and removes characters from it, which can be inefficient for large inputs.

To fix the program, a more correct approach would involve generating all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` letters and checking if each one is a subsequence of `s`. This can be done using a recursive or iterative approach to generate the strings and a function to check if a string is a subsequence of another string.

Here is a more correct approach to solve the problem:

```python
def is_subsequence(x, y):
    it = iter(y)
    return all(c in it for c in x)

def generate_strings(n, k):
    if n == 0:
        return [""]
    smaller_strings = generate_strings(n - 1, k)
    return [chr(97 + i) + s for s in smaller_strings for i in range(k)]

t = int(input())
OUT = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    all_strings = generate_strings(n, k)
    missing = None
    for string in all_strings:
        if not is_subsequence(string, s):
            missing = string
            break
    if missing is None:
        OUT.append('YES')
    else:
        OUT.append('NO')
        OUT.append(missing)

for i in OUT:
    print(i)
```

This program correctly generates all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` letters and checks if each one is a subsequence of `s`. If a missing string is found, it is printed as the output.
