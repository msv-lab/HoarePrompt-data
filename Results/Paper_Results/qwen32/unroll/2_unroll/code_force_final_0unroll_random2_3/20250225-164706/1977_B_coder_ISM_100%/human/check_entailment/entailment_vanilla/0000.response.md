Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find an array `a` of length `n` (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 32`), such that each element in `a` is either `1`, `0`, or `-1`.
- The array must satisfy `x = Σ(a_i * 2^i)` for a given positive integer `x` (where `1 ≤ x < 2^30`).
- No two consecutive elements in `a` should be non-zero.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a positive integer `x`.

2. **Initial Binary Representation**:
   - The program converts `x` into a binary string `s` of length 30, where each element is either `'1'` or `'0'` based on whether the corresponding bit in `x` is set.

3. **Adjusting the Array**:
   - The program then iterates through the binary representation to adjust it according to the rules:
     - If two consecutive `'1'`s are found, the first `'1'` is replaced with `'-1'` and the second `'1'` is replaced with `'0'`.
     - If it encounters a `'1'` that is not followed by another `'1'` and a flag is set, it sets that `'1'` to `'0'` and sets the next element to `'1'`.
     - If the last element is `'0'` and the flag is set, it sets the last element to `'1'`.
     - If the last element is `'1'` and the flag is set, it sets the last element to `'0'` and appends an additional `'1'` to the array, increasing the length by 1.

4. **Final Adjustment**:
   - The program ensures that no two consecutive elements are non-zero by swapping `'1'`s and `'-1'`s as necessary.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the array and the array itself.

### Correctness Check:

- **Binary Conversion**:
  - The initial binary conversion is correct, but it only considers `'1'`s and `'0'`s, not `'-1'`s.

- **Adjustment Logic**:
  - The adjustment logic aims to ensure that no two consecutive elements are non-zero by replacing `'1'`s with `'-1'`s and `'0'`s as needed.
  - This logic is generally correct, but there are some edge cases that need to be handled properly (e.g., when the last element is `'1'` and the flag is set, it correctly appends an additional `'1'`).

- **Output**:
  - The output format is correct, printing the length of the array and the array itself.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to correctly adjust the binary representation of `x` to meet the problem's requirements, ensuring that no two consecutive elements are non-zero and that the sum of the array elements multiplied by their respective powers of 2 equals `x`.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
