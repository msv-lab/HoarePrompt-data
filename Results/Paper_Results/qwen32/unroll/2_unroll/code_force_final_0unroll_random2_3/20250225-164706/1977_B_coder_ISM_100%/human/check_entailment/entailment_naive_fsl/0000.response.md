Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the condition that there should not exist an index \(0 \le i \le n-2\) such that both \(a_i \neq 0\) and \(a_{i+1} \neq 0\). Specifically, the program does not ensure that no two consecutive elements in the array are non-zero.

Let's consider a test case to demonstrate the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
1
3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
1 1
```
or
```
3
1 0 1
```
or any other valid representation where no two consecutive elements are non-zero.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
2
1 1
```

In this case, the output `1 1` is incorrect because it violates the condition that no two consecutive elements should be non-zero.

To fix this, the program needs to be modified to ensure that when it sets a position to `1` or `-1`, it checks the adjacent positions to ensure they are `0` before setting the current position. Additionally, the program should handle edge cases properly, such as when the input is a power of 2 or when the input requires the use of `-1`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        s = []
        length = 0
        while x > 0:
            if x % 2 == 1:
                if length > 0 and s[-1] != 0:
                    s[-1] = -1
                    x += 1
                s.append(1)
            else:
                s.append(0)
            x //= 2
            length += 1
        print(length)
        print(*s)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version ensures that no two consecutive elements are non-zero by adjusting the previous element to `-1` if necessary when setting the current element to `1`.
