Reasoning:  
The given program is intended to solve the problem by calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions. However, the logic used in the program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements.

The problem states that for each pair (a, b), the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` must be satisfied. The provided program, on the other hand, calculates `ans` by starting with `n` and then adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`. This approach does not account for the `gcd(a, b)` part of the condition and incorrectly assumes that `(n + b) // (b * b)` is related to the number of valid pairs for each `b`.

To correctly solve the problem, for each `b` from 1 to `m`, we need to determine how many `a` values from 1 to `n` satisfy the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. This requires iterating over possible `a` values and checking the condition for each pair, which is computationally expensive given the constraints.

However, the given program does not perform this check and instead uses an incorrect formula. Therefore, the program is not correct for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
