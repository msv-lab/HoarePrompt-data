### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Provided Program
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)
```

#### Analysis of the Program
The provided program initializes `ans` to `n` and then iterates over `b` from `2` to `min(n, m)`, adding \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to `ans` for each `b`. The original assessment suggests that this formula does not match the problem description.

Let's break down the logic of the program to see if it can be valid:

1. **Initialization of `ans`**: The program initializes `ans` to `n`. This might be correct because when \(b = 1\), \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\), and the condition \(a + 1\) being a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1)\) simplifies to \(a + 1\) being a multiple of 1, which is always true. Therefore, there are `n` valid pairs for \(b = 1\).

2. **Loop over `b`**: The loop iterates from `b = 2` to `min(n, m)`. This is reasonable because we need to check all possible values of `b`.

3. **Calculation of `ans`**: The expression \((n + b) // (b * b)\) is the key part to validate. To understand this, let's consider the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

For a given \(b\), let \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then \(a = dk\) for some integer \(k\), and the condition becomes:
\[ dk + b \equiv 0 \pmod{bd} \]
\[ dk + b \equiv 0 \pmod{bd} \]
\[ dk + b = bdq \text{ for some integer } q \]
\[ dk = bdq - b \]
\[ dk = b(dq - 1) \]
\[ k = q(d - 1) \]

The number of valid `k` values (and thus `a` values) is determined by how many times \(b\) can fit into `n` when scaled by \(d\). The formula \((n + b) // (b * b)\) seems to be a simplified way to count these valid `k` values for each `b`.

#### Verification with Examples
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case**: \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\)
   - Only pair is \((1, 1)\), which satisfies the condition.
   - Program output: `1` (correct)

2. **Second Test Case**: \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\)
   - Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\)
   - Program output: `3` (correct)

3. **Third Test Case**: \(n = 3\), \(m = 5\)
   - Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((3, 1)\), \((3, 3)\)
   - Program output: `4` (correct)

4. **Fourth Test Case**: \(n = 10\), \(m = 8\)
   - Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 1)\), \((4, 1)\), \((5, 1)\), \((6, 1)\), \((6, 2)\), \((6, 3)\), \((7, 1)\), \((8, 1)\), \((9, 1)\), \((10, 1)\), \((10, 2)\)
   - Program output: `14` (correct)

The program seems to produce the correct results for the given examples, indicating that the formula \((n + b) // (b * b)\) might indeed be a valid way to count the number of valid pairs for each `b`.

### Conclusion
Given that the program produces the correct results for the provided examples and the reasoning behind the formula seems valid, the original assessment might be incorrect.

### Final Answer
Final: **True**
