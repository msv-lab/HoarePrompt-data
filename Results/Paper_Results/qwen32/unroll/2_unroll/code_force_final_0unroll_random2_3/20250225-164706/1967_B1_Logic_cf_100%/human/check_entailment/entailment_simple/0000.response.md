Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by iterating over possible values of `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)` and calculating the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for each `b`. The formula `(n + b) // (b * b)` is used to determine the number of valid `a` values for each `b`. However, this approach does not correctly address the condition that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

Let's break down the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`:
- For any pair `(a, b)`, `gcd(a, b)` is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.
- The condition can be rewritten as `(a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0`.

The given program does not correctly calculate the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy this condition. Specifically, it does not account for the `gcd(a, b)` in the denominator of the condition.

A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible values of `b` and, for each `b`, iterating over possible values of `a` to check if the condition is satisfied. This approach would be computationally expensive for large values of `n` and `m`, so optimizations would be necessary.

Given the provided program, it does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
