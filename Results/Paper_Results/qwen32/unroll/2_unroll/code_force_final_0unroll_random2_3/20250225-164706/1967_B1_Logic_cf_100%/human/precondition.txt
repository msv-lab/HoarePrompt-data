n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6. The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Each subsequent line contains two integers n and m for each test case. The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^6.
