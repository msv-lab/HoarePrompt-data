Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6). It processes each test case and returns an output based on the values of `n` and `m`. The sum of all `n` and the sum of all `m` across all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^6.**
