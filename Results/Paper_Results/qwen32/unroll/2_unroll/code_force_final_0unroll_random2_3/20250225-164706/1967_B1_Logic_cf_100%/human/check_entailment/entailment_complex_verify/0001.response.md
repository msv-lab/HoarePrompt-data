### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided program to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Analysis
The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve the problem with the following steps:
1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the values of `n` and `m`.
   - Initialize `ans` to `n`.
   - Iterate `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)` (inclusive).
   - For each `b`, increment `ans` by \((n + b) // (b * b)\).
   - Print `ans`.

#### Verification
Let's verify if the logic of the program aligns with the problem's requirements.

##### Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `ans` to `n`. This is correct because for `b = 1`, all `a` from 1 to `n` will satisfy the condition since \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\), and \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of \(1\).

2. **Loop for `b`**: The loop iterates `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`. This is correct because the problem requires \(1 \leq b \leq m\) and the condition is symmetric in `a` and `b`.

3. **Condition Check**: The program increments `ans` by \((n + b) // (b * b)\). This is incorrect. The condition to check is whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The given formula does not correctly account for this condition.

### Correct Formula
To correctly solve the problem, we need to find pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
\[ a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} \]
This can be simplified by considering the gcd and the range of `a` and `b`.

### Detailed Analysis
The provided program's logic is flawed because it does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it uses a formula that does not capture the essence of the problem.

To correctly count the number of valid pairs, we need to iterate through all possible values of `a` and `b` and check the condition directly. However, given the constraints, a direct approach would be inefficient.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\). The formula used to increment `ans` is not correct for the given problem's requirement.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
