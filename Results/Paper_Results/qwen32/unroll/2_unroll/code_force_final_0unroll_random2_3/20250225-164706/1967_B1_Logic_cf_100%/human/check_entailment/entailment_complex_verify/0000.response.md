### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code.

#### Problem Recap:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)
```

#### Annotations Recap:
The annotations describe the state of the program before and after key points:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
- It initializes `ans` to `n`.
- It iterates over `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`.
- It updates `ans` by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)`.
- Finally, it prints `ans`.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment correctly points out that the formula `(n + b) // (b * b)` does not match the problem description. The program does not correctly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Detailed Evaluation:
1. **Initialization of `ans`**: 
   - The program initializes `ans` to `n`. This is correct because for \(b = 1\), \(a + b = a + 1\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1\), so every \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) is valid. Hence, there are \(n\) such pairs for \(b = 1\).

2. **Loop over `b`**:
   - The loop iterates from \(b = 2\) to \(\min(n, m)\). This is correct as it covers all possible values of \(b\).

3. **Calculation of `ans`**:
   - The formula `(n + b) // (b * b)` is used to update `ans`. This formula is not derived from the problem statement. The correct approach would involve checking each pair \((a, b)\) to see if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would be:
```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)
```
However, this approach is inefficient for large \(n\) and \(m\) due to the nested loops.

#### Conclusion:
Given the mismatch between the provided formula and the problem description, the program is incorrect. The formula `(n + b) // (b * b)` does not correctly compute the number of valid pairs for each \(b\).

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
