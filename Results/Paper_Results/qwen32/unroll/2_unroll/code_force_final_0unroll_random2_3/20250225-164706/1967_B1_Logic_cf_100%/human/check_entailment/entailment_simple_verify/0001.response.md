### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Let's break down the reasoning in detail:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `ans` to `n`, which is correct because for `b = 1`, every `a` from 1 to `n` will satisfy the condition since \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\), and \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of 1.

2. **Loop for `b`**: The loop iterates `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`, which is also correct because the problem requires `1 \leq b \leq m`.

3. **Condition Check**: The critical issue lies in the formula used to increment `ans`. The program increments `ans` by \((n + b) // (b * b)\). This formula does not correctly account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To correctly solve the problem, we need to check for each pair \((a, b)\) whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The provided program's formula does not perform this check correctly.

### Verification:
Let's verify this with the example provided in the problem description:

- For the test case `(10, 8)`:
  - The correct pairs are: (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (10,2).
  - The number of valid pairs is 14.

- The program's logic would not correctly count these pairs because the formula used does not properly check the condition.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis and the verification, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\). Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
