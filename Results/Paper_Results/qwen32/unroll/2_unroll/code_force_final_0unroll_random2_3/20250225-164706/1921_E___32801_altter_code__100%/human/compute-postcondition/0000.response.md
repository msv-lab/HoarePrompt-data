The provided code snippet reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `r`. This operation does not affect the initial state of the variables `t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` as they are not directly involved in the execution of this particular line of code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each of the t test cases, `h` and `w` are positive integers such that 1 <= h <= 10^6 and 1 <= w <= 10^9; `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `x_a`, `x_b` <= `h` and 1 <= `y_a`, `y_b` <= `w`; additionally, `x_a` != `x_b` or `y_a` != `y_b`, ensuring the chips do not start in the same cell; `r` is a list of integers read from the input.**
