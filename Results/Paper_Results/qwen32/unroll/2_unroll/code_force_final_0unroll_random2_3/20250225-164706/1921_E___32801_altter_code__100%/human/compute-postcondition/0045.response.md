Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

The initial state describes a complex set of variables and conditions, but the print statement is straightforward:
```python
print('Alice')
```

This print statement directly outputs the string `'Alice'`. The value to be printed is explicitly given and does not depend on the values of any variables or conditions described in the initial state.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **Alice**
