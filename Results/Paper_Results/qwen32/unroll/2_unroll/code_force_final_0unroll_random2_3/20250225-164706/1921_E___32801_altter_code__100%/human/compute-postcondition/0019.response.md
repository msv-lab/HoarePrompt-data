Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Test Cases (`t`)**: There are `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4.
2. **Dimensions (`h` and `w`)**: For each test case, there are positive integers `h` and `w` representing the dimensions of a grid, where `1 <= h <= 10^6` and `1 <= w <= 10^9`.
3. **Chip Positions (`x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`)**: There are two chips on the grid, and their positions are given by `x_a`, `y_a` for the first chip and `x_b`, `y_b` for the second chip. These positions are positive integers, and the chips do not start in the same cell.
4. **List `r`**: This list contains integers read from the input. The first two integers are `n` and `m`, and the next four integers are used to calculate `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`.
5. **Calculated Positions (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`)**:
   - `n` is the first integer in `r`.
   - `m` is the second integer in `r`.
   - `x1` is calculated as `r[2] + 1`.
   - `y1` is calculated based on the condition:
     - If `y2 > y1`, then `y1 = r[3] + 1`.
     - If `y2 <= y1`, then `y1 = r[3] - 1`.
   - `x2` is `r[4]`.
   - `y2` is `r[5]`.
   - It is given that `x2 > x1`.
   - The difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd if `y2 > y1` or even if `y2 <= y1`.
   - `y1` is explicitly stated to be equal to `y2`.

### Analysis of Given Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print('Alice')
```

### Explanation:
The print statement simply outputs the string `'Alice'`. There are no variables or conditions in the print statement that depend on the values of `t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, or `y2`. The string `'Alice'` is hardcoded and will be printed as is.

### Output:
Output: **Alice**
