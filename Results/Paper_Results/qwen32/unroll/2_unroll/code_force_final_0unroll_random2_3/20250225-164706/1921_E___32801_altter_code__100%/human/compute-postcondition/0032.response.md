The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'draw'`. The initial state describes various variables and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of these variables.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. The `print` statement in the code snippet is: `print('draw')`.
2. This statement directly prints the string `'draw'` to the console.
3. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `a`, `b`), but none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement.
4. Since there are no variables involved in the `print` statement, the output is simply the string `'draw'`.

Output: **draw**
