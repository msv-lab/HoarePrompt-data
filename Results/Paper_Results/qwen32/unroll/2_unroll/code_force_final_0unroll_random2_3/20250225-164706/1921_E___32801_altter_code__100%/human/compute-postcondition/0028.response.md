The code snippet `t = abs(y2 - y1)` calculates the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` and assigns this value back to `t`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, this value of `t` is overwritten by the new calculation. The variables `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `a`, and `b` all retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `h` is a positive integer such that 1 <= h <= 10^6, `w` is a positive integer such that 1 <= w <= 10^9, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `x_a`, `x_b` <= `h` and 1 <= `y_a`, `y_b` <= `w`; additionally, `x_a` != `x_b` or `y_a` != `y_b`, `r` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + 1`, `y1` is either `r[3] + 1` if `y2` > `y1` or `r[3] - 1` if `y2` <= `y1`, `x2` is `r[4]`, `y2` is `r[5]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd if `y2` > `y1` or even if `y2` <= `y1`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `a` is `y2 - 1` if `y1` >= `y2` otherwise `m - y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1`**.
