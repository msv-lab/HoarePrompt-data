The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'draw'`. The initial state provides a detailed description of several variables and their constraints, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will simply be the string `'draw'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print('draw')`.
2. The string `'draw'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.
3. None of the variables described in the initial state (`t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`) are referenced in the `print` statement.
4. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string `'draw'`.

Output: **draw**
