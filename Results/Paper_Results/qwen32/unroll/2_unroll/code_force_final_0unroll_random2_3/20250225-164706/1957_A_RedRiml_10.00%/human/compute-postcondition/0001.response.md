The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `w`. The loop will execute based on the value of `w`. The loop will execute `w` times if `w` is greater than 0. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are not directly involved in the loop execution condition.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `w` must be greater than 0. The other variables can remain as they are since they do not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` must be greater than 0**
