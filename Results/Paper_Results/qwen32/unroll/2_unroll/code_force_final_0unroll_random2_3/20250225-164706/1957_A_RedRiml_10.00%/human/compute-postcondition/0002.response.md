To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand what the loop does in each iteration. The loop runs `w` times, and in each iteration, it performs the following steps:

1. It reads an integer `ln` which is the number of elements in the next list.
2. It reads a list `palka` of `ln` integers.
3. It initializes an empty list `pl` and an empty dictionary `d`.
4. For each integer `i` in `palka`, it updates the dictionary `d` to count the occurrences of `i` and appends `i` to `pl` if `i` is not already in `pl`.
5. It initializes a variable `shapes` to 0.
6. For each unique integer `j` in `pl`, it checks if `j` appears at least 3 times in the list `palka` (using the dictionary `d`). If it does, it increments the `shapes` variable by 1.
7. It prints the value of `shapes`.

After all `w` iterations, the loop will have printed the number of integers that appeared at least 3 times in each of the `w` input lists. The variables `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and `w` are not modified by the loop and thus remain unchanged.

Output State: **The variables `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and `w` remain unchanged. The loop prints the number of integers that appeared at least 3 times for each of the `w` input lists.**
