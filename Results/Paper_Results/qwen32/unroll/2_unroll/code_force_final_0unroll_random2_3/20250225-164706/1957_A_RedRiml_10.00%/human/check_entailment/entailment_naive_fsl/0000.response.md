Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed simultaneously. The main issue is that it only checks if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length and counts that as one polygon, which is incorrect. It does not account for the fact that a polygon must have more than 2 sides and it does not maximize the number of polygons that can be formed.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2
```
The correct output should be `2` because we can form two equilateral triangles (each with 3 sides). However, the provided program will output `1` because it only counts one polygon with at least 3 sticks of the same length.

Another example:
```
1
8
3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3
```
The correct output should be `2` because we can form two regular hexagons (each with 6 sides). The provided program will also output `1` for this case.

The program needs to be modified to correctly count the maximum number of polygons that can be formed by dividing the count of sticks of each length by the possible number of sides of a polygon (starting from 3 and going upwards) and summing these counts.
