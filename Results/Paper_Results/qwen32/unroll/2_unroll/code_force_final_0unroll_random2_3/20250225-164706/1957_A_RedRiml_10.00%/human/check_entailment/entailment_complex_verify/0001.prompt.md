You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.

    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        pl = []
        
        d = {}
        
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:

        print(shapes)
        
    #State: The variables `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and `w` remain unchanged. The loop prints the number of integers that appeared at least 3 times for each of the `w` input lists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `w` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `ln` and a list of `ln` integers. It then calculates and prints the number of distinct integers in the list that appear at least 3 times.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed using the given sticks, where each stick can be used in exactly one polygon and no stick can be broken. The key points are:

1. We need at least 3 sticks of the same length to form a polygon.
2. Each stick can be used in only one polygon.
3. The goal is to maximize the number of polygons.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program `func()` follows these steps:

1. It reads the number of test cases `w`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `ln` and the lengths of the sticks `palka`.
3. It initializes an empty list `pl` to store unique stick lengths and a dictionary `d` to store the count of each stick length.
4. It iterates through the list of stick lengths `palka` to populate the dictionary `d` with the count of each length and the list `pl` with unique stick lengths.
5. It initializes a counter `shapes` to 0 to keep track of the number of polygons that can be formed.
6. It iterates through the list of unique stick lengths `pl` and checks if the count of any stick length is 3 or more. If so, it increments the `shapes` counter by 1.
7. Finally, it prints the value of `shapes` for each test case.

### Flaws in the Program:
The main flaw in the program is that it only counts the number of unique stick lengths that have at least 3 sticks, without considering the optimal way to form polygons. For example, if there are 6 sticks of length 3, the program will only count this as 1 polygon, but it could actually form 2 triangles (polygons with 3 sides).

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to divide the count of each stick length by 3 (the minimum number of sticks needed to form a polygon) and sum up these quotients. This will give us the maximum number of polygons that can be formed.

### Correctness:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It only counts the number of unique stick lengths with at least 3 sticks, which is insufficient to determine the maximum number of polygons that can be formed.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
