To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the loop condition `low <= high`. Given the state right before the loop:

- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9
- `low` is 0
- `high` is min(n, b)
- `max_profit` is 0

The loop will execute if `low` is less than or equal to `high`. Since `low` is 0 and `high` is `min(n, b)`, and both `n` and `b` are at least 1, `high` will also be at least 0. Therefore, the condition `low <= high` will always be true.

No adjustments are needed because the initial state already satisfies the loop condition.

State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is min(n, b); `max_profit` is 0**
