Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, which is the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains four elements: `n`, the number of integers in the list `a`; `x`, an integer; `y`, an integer; and `a`, a list of `n` integers. The function returns a list `results` where each element is the count of beautiful pairs for the corresponding test case. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) such that 1 <= i < j <= n and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a[i] + x and a[j] + y is greater than 1.**
