In the given task, the loop iterates over `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple represents a test case with the form `(n, x, y, a)`. To ensure that the loop executes, `test_cases` must contain at least one test case. 

Let's analyze the loop head:
- `case` is the variable that will take on the value of each tuple in `test_cases` during each iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `test_cases` to ensure it contains at least one test case. The other variables `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `results` are not directly part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple of the form (n, x, y, a) where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, x and y are integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `results` is an empty list**
