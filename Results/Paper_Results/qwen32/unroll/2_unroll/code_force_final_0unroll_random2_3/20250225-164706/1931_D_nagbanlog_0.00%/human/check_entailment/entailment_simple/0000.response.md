### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to find the number of beautiful pairs in an array for each test case. A pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if the sum of the elements at these indices is divisible by \(x\) and their difference is divisible by \(y\).

#### Key Steps in the Program:
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs \((a_i \% x, a_i \% y)\) encountered so far.
2. **Iterating through the array**: For each element in the array, it calculates \(a_i \% x\) and \(a_i \% y\).
3. **Calculating required_mod_x and required_mod_y**:
   - `required_mod_x` is calculated as \((x - mod_x) \% x\). This is based on the requirement that \(a_i + a_j\) should be divisible by \(x\). If \(a_i \% x = mod_x\), then \(a_j \% x\) should be \((x - mod_x) \% x\).
   - `required_mod_y` is the same as `mod_y` because \(a_i - a_j\) should be divisible by \(y\), so \(a_j \% y\) should be the same as \(a_i \% y\).
4. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**: If the pair \((required_mod_x, required_mod_y)\) exists in the `freq` dictionary, it means there are elements previously seen that can form a beautiful pair with the current element, and the count is incremented by the frequency of this pair.
5. **Updating Frequency**: The frequency of the current pair \((mod_x, mod_y)\) is updated in the `freq` dictionary.

#### Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies the conditions for a beautiful pair and efficiently counts them using a frequency dictionary.
- The logic for calculating `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` is accurate based on the problem requirements.
- The program processes each test case independently and returns the correct count of beautiful pairs for each.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs as per the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
