You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case is represented by a tuple (n, x, y, a), where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, x and y are integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, x, y = case['params']
        
        a = case['array']
        
        freq = {}
        
        beautiful_count = 0
        
        print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
        
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
            required_mod_y = mod_y
            print(
                f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
                )
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
            if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
                freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
        
        print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
        
        results.append(beautiful_count)
        
    #State: `results` is a list containing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case. Each element in `results` corresponds to the `beautiful_count` computed for each test case in `test_cases`. The other variables like `t`, `test_cases` remain unchanged.
    return results
    #The program returns the list `results` which contains the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, which is the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains four elements: `n`, the number of integers in the list `a`; `x`, an integer; `y`, an integer; and `a`, a list of `n` integers. The function returns a list `results` where each element is the count of beautiful pairs for the corresponding test case. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) such that 1 <= i < j <= n and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a[i] + x and a[j] + y is greater than 1.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `results` which contains the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
