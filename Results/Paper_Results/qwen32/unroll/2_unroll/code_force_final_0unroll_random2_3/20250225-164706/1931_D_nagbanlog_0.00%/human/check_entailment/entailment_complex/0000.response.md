### Reasoning:

The given program aims to count the number of "beautiful pairs" in an array based on specified conditions. To determine if the program is correct, let's break down the logic and compare it with the problem's requirements.

1. **Modular Conditions**:
   - For a pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be considered beautiful, two conditions must be met:
     1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
     2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

2. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The program uses modular arithmetic to check these conditions. Specifically, it computes:
     - `mod_x = num % x` for each element `num` in the array.
     - `mod_y = num % y` for each element `num` in the array.
   - The condition \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) translates to \((a_i \mod x) + (a_j \mod x) \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\). This can be rewritten as \((a_i \mod x) \equiv (x - a_j \mod x) \pmod{x}\).
   - The condition \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\) translates to \((a_i \mod y) \equiv (a_j \mod y) \pmod{y}\).

3. **Tracking Frequencies**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` encountered so far.
   - For each number in the array, it calculates the required `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` that would make the current number form a beautiful pair with any previously seen number.
   - If such a pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the `freq` dictionary, it increments the `beautiful_count` by the frequency of that pair.
   - It then updates the frequency of the current `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the `freq` dictionary.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where `x` and `y` are different and equal.
   - It correctly processes multiple test cases and returns the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

5. **Output**:
   - The program returns a list of counts, each corresponding to the number of beautiful pairs found in the respective test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs based on the given conditions. It efficiently uses modular arithmetic and frequency counting to achieve the desired result. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
