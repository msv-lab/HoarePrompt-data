Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of beautiful pairs in an array `a` of length `n`. A pair of indices `<i, j>` is beautiful if:
1. `a[i] + a[j]` is divisible by `x`.
2. `a[i] - a[j]` is divisible by `y`.

### Key Observations:
1. For `a[i] + a[j]` to be divisible by `x`, `(a[i] % x) + (a[j] % x)` should be divisible by `x`.
2. For `a[i] - a[j]` to be divisible by `y`, `(a[i] % y) - (a[j] % y)` should be divisible by `y`.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs of remainders `(a[i] % x, a[i] % y)`.

For each number in the array `a`, the program calculates:
- `mod_x = num % x`
- `mod_y = num % y`
- `required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x` (This is the value that `a[j] % x` should have to satisfy the first condition with `a[i]`)
- `required_mod_y = mod_y` (This is the value that `a[j] % y` should have to satisfy the second condition with `a[i]`)

If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is already in `freq`, it means there are numbers in the array that, when paired with the current number, form a beautiful pair. The count of such numbers is added to `beautiful_count`.

The program then updates the frequency of the current pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the `freq` dictionary.

### Function Summary:
The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and two additional integers. For each test case, it calculates the number of "beautiful pairs" within the list, where a "beautiful pair" is defined by specific modular conditions involving the additional integers. The function returns a list of counts, each corresponding to the number of beautiful pairs found in the respective test case.

### Original Assessment:
The original assessment concludes that the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. It notes that the logic for `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` is correct, and there are no logical errors in the provided program.

### Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Condition for `a[i] + a[j]` divisible by `x`:**
   - We need `(a[i] % x) + (a[j] % x) ≡ 0 (mod x)`.
   - This is equivalent to `a[j] % x ≡ (x - a[i] % x) % x`.
   - The program correctly calculates `required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x`.

2. **Condition for `a[i] - a[j]` divisible by `y`:**
   - We need `(a[i] % y) - (a[j] % y) ≡ 0 (mod y)`.
   - This is equivalent to `a[j] % y ≡ a[i] % y`.
   - The program correctly calculates `required_mod_y = mod_y`.

The program uses these conditions to count the number of beautiful pairs efficiently by leveraging a frequency dictionary.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. There are no logical errors in the provided program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
