### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided code and function summaries to ensure everything aligns with the problem description and the original assessment.

#### Function `func_1(n, p)`:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The `dp` array is initialized with `dp[offset] = 1`, where `offset = n`. This is correct because it represents the starting point of the prefix sums, which starts at 0.

2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
   - The code iterates through each element in `p` and updates the `dp` array based on the possible transitions (either adding 1 or subtracting 1). This is correct as it simulates the formation of prefix sums by considering each element in the array `a` which can be either `1` or `-1`.

3. **Final Result**:
   - The final result is taken from `dp[final_sum]`, where `final_sum` is the value of the last element in `p` adjusted by the offset. This is correct because `p[-1]` represents the final prefix sum, and adding `offset` ensures the index is within the bounds of the `dp` array.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The modulo operation is applied correctly to ensure the result does not overflow.

#### Function `func_2()`:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case by calling `func_1(n, p)`, and stores the results.
   - It then prints the results for all test cases. This is correct as it handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

#### Function Summary:

The function summary for `func_2` states:
- "The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers representing sorted prefix sums. For each test case, it computes and prints the hidden array `a` that corresponds to these prefix sums."

This summary is inaccurate. The function does not compute the hidden array `a` itself. Instead, it computes the number of possible hidden arrays `a` that can result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`. The summary should be revised to reflect this.

#### Testing:

The original assessment tested the code with the provided examples, and the code produced the correct results for all examples. This indicates that the code is likely correct.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate in terms of the correctness of the code. However, the function summary for `func_2` is inaccurate and should be corrected to reflect that the function computes the number of possible hidden arrays `a` rather than the hidden arrays themselves.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The provided code is correct, and the original assessment is accurate with the exception of the function summary for `func_2`.
