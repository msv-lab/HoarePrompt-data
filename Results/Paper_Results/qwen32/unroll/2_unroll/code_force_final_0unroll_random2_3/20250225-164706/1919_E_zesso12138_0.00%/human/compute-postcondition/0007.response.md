To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to analyze the loop's effect on the variables and understand the role of `func_1`. However, since `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, we will assume that `func_1` processes the input parameters `n` and `p` and returns some result which is appended to the `results` list.

Given the loop iterates `t` times, each iteration will:
1. Update `n` to the integer value of `data[index]`.
2. Increment `index` by 1.
3. Update `p` to the list of integers from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`.
4. Increment `index` by `n`.
5. Call `func_1(n, p)` and append the result to `results`.

After `t` iterations, the `index` will have been incremented by `1 + n1 + 1 + n2 + ... + 1 + nt`, where `n1, n2, ..., nt` are the sizes of the arrays `p` for each iteration. The `results` list will contain `t` elements, each being the result of `func_1` for the corresponding `n` and `p`.

Since we do not have the definition of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact values in `results`. However, we can describe the state in terms of how it changes.

Output State: **`n` is the size of the last processed array `p`; `p` is the last processed list of integers; `input` holds the entire input provided as a string; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace; `index` is the position in `data` after processing all `t` arrays; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is a list of `t` elements, each being the result of `func_1` for the corresponding `n` and `p`.**
