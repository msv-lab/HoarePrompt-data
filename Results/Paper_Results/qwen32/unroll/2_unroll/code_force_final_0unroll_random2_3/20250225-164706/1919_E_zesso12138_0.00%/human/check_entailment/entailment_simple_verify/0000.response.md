### Reasoning

The original assessment appears to be accurate based on the provided problem description, code, and annotated code. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The `dp` array is initialized with `dp[offset] = 1` where `offset = n`. This correctly represents the starting point of the prefix sums, as the initial prefix sum is `0` and `offset` is used to handle negative indices.

2. **Transitions**:
   - The code iterates through each element in `p` and updates the `dp` array based on the possible transitions (either adding `1` or subtracting `1`). This is consistent with the problem's requirement of forming prefix sums by adding or subtracting `1` at each step.

3. **Final Result**:
   - The final result is correctly taken from `dp[final_sum]`, where `final_sum` is the value of the last element in `p` adjusted by the offset. This ensures that the code correctly identifies the number of ways to reach the final prefix sum.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The modulo operation is applied correctly to ensure the result does not overflow, which is crucial given the constraints of the problem.

5. **Testing with Examples**:
   - The code is tested with several examples, and it produces the correct results for each case. This includes edge cases and typical cases, which further supports the correctness of the implementation.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis and verification with the provided examples, the original assessment is accurate. The code correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem as described.
