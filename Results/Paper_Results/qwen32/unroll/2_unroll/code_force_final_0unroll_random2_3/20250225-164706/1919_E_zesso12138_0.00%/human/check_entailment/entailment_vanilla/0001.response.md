Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Given a sorted prefix sum array `p` derived from an array `a` consisting of 1s and -1s, determine the number of possible initial arrays `a` that could result in the given `p`.

2. **Key Points**:
   - The prefix sum array `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - The array `a` is of size `n` and consists only of 1s and -1s.
   - The prefix sum `p_i` is defined as `p_i = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_i`.
   - The number of possible arrays `a` should be computed modulo `998,244,353`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(n, p)`**:
   - **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The function uses dynamic programming to count the number of ways to form the prefix sum array `p` from an array `a`.
   - **State Representation**: `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to reach a prefix sum of `j - offset` after processing some elements of `a`.
   - **Initialization**: `dp[offset] = 1` initializes the starting point (prefix sum 0).
   - **Transition**: For each element in `a`, the program updates the `dp` array by considering the addition or subtraction of 1 to the current prefix sum.
   - **Final State**: The final result is obtained from `dp[final_sum]`, where `final_sum` is the last element of `p` adjusted by `offset`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - **Input Handling**: Reads input, processes each test case, and prints the results.
   - **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, p)` to compute the number of possible arrays `a` and stores the result.
   - **Output**: Prints the results for each test case.

### Correctness Check:
- The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` is appropriate for counting the possible ways to reach each prefix sum, considering the constraints.
- The use of `offset` ensures that the prefix sums are handled within a valid range.
- The modulo operation (`% MOD`) ensures that the results are computed within the required range.
- The overall structure of the program correctly processes multiple test cases and outputs the results.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It efficiently counts the number of possible initial arrays `a` that could result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

**Correctness: True**
