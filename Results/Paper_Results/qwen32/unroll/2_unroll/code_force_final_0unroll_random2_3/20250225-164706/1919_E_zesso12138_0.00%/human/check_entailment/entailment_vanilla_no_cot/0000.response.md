To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the approach and the implementation step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the number of possible arrays `a` of size `n` consisting of only `1` and `-1` such that when we compute the prefix sums of `a`, sort them, and the result matches the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

### Approach Analysis

The approach taken in the program is dynamic programming (DP). Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `dp` array is used to keep track of the number of ways to reach a particular prefix sum.
   - `offset` is used to shift the range of possible prefix sums to non-negative indices.
   - `dp[offset] = 1` initializes the starting point (prefix sum of an empty array).

2. **DP Transition**:
   - For each element in the array `a`, we can either add `1` or `-1` to the current prefix sum.
   - `new_dp` is used to store the number of ways to reach each prefix sum after processing the current element.
   - For each possible prefix sum `j` in `dp`, we update `new_dp[j + 1]` and `new_dp[j - 1]` by adding the number of ways to reach `j`.

3. **Result Calculation**:
   - After processing all elements, the number of ways to reach the final prefix sum (which is `p[-1]` in the sorted array) is stored in `dp[final_sum]`.

### Implementation Details

- **MOD**: The result is taken modulo `998,244,353` to handle large numbers.
- **Input Handling**: The input is read in one go, parsed, and processed for each test case.

### Correctness Check

Let's verify if the approach and implementation correctly solve the problem:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Correctly initializes the DP table with `dp[offset] = 1`.

2. **DP Transition**:
   - Correctly updates the DP table for each element in the array `a` by considering both possible values (`1` and `-1`).

3. **Result Calculation**:
   - Correctly identifies the final prefix sum as `p[-1]` and returns the number of ways to reach this sum.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where the sorted prefix sum array `p` does not match any possible prefix sum array derived from any array `a` of `1` and `-1`.

5. **Input Handling**:
   - Efficiently reads and processes multiple test cases.

### Conclusion

The provided program uses a correct dynamic programming approach to count the number of possible arrays `a` that can result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`. The implementation correctly handles all aspects of the problem, including edge cases and large numbers through modular arithmetic.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
