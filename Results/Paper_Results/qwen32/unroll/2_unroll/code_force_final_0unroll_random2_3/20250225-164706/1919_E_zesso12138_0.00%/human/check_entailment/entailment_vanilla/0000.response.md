Let's analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem involves finding the number of possible initial arrays `a` of size `n` consisting of `1` and `-1` such that when we compute the prefix sums `p` and then sort `p`, we get a given sorted array `p`.

### Key Points
1. **Prefix Sums**: Given an array `a`, the prefix sum array `p` is defined as `p_i = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_i`.
2. **Sorting**: The prefix sum array `p` is then sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. **Objective**: Determine how many initial arrays `a` can produce the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

### Approach
The approach in the code involves dynamic programming:
- We use a DP array `dp` where `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to achieve a prefix sum of `j - offset` (where `offset` is used to handle negative indices).
- We iterate through each element in the array `a` and update the DP array based on the possible values of the next prefix sum (`j + 1` or `j - 1`).
- Finally, we check the number of ways to achieve the final prefix sum (given by `p[-1]`).

### Detailed Analysis of the Code
1. **Initialization**:
   - `dp` array is initialized to handle sums from `-n` to `n` (hence size `2 * n + 1`).
   - `offset` is used to map negative indices to positive indices in the `dp` array.
   - `dp[offset]` is set to `1` because there's one way to have a prefix sum of `0` at the start.

2. **DP Update**:
   - For each element in `a`, we update the `dp` array based on the possible prefix sums that can be achieved by adding `1` or `-1` to the current prefix sum.
   - This is done by iterating through all possible prefix sums and updating the new DP array `new_dp` accordingly.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - After processing all elements, the final prefix sum is given by `p[-1]`.
   - The number of ways to achieve this final prefix sum is stored in `dp[final_sum]`.

### Correctness Check
- The DP approach correctly models the problem of counting the number of ways to achieve the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
- The use of `offset` ensures that we can handle negative prefix sums.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

### Conclusion
The provided code correctly implements the described approach and should produce the correct results for the given problem.

**Correctness: True**
