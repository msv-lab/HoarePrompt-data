Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
2. `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^{18}.
3. `n` is greater than or equal to `k` (n >= k).
4. `n` is not equal to `k` (n != k).
5. `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1` (k - 1 < n - k + 1).

### Print Statement:
```
print(n - k + 1, 1)
```

### Analysis:
- The first value to be printed is `n - k + 1`.
- The second value to be printed is `1`.

#### Value of `n - k + 1`:
- From the precondition, we know that `n >= k` and `n != k`, so `n - k` is a positive integer.
- Additionally, `k - 1 < n - k + 1` can be rearranged to `2k - 2 < n` or `2k < n + 2` or `k < (n + 2) / 2`. This condition is always satisfied for `n > k`, so it doesn't provide additional constraints on the value of `n - k + 1` beyond it being a positive integer.

#### Value of `1`:
- This is a constant value and will always be `1`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the value of `n - k + 1` followed by the constant value `1`.

### Output:
Output: **n - k + 1, 1 (where n - k + 1 is the difference between n and k plus 1)**
