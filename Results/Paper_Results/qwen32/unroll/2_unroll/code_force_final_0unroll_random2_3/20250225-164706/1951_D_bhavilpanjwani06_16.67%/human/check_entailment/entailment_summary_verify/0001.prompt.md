You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
    elif n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(n)
    elif k - 1 < n - k + 1:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(n - k + 1, 1)
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input and prints "YES" followed by specific values if `n` is greater than or equal to `k` and certain conditions are met; otherwise, it prints "NO".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
Bob has up to 60 stalls to sell jewels to Alice, who will buy greedily. Alice has `n` coins and Bob wants her to buy exactly `k` jewels. The problem requires us to determine if there is a way to set up the stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases and for each case, it checks:
1. If `n < k`, it prints "NO" because Alice does not have enough coins to buy `k` jewels.
2. If `n == k`, it prints "YES", sets up one stall with price `n`, and Alice buys exactly one jewel for all her coins.
3. If `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, it prints "YES", sets up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1`, and Alice buys `k - 1` jewels at the first stall and 1 jewel at the second stall, totaling `k` jewels.
4. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Issues in the Program
1. **Handling of Large `k` Values**: The program only checks for three specific conditions and does not handle the general case where `k` can be much larger than `n` or where more than two stalls are needed.
2. **General Case Handling**: The program does not consider cases where more than two stalls are necessary to achieve exactly `k` jewels. For example, if `k` is large, we might need to use multiple stalls with different prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels without exceeding her budget.
3. **Correctness of Conditions**: The conditions in the program do not cover all possible scenarios. For instance, the condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` is not sufficient to ensure that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels in all cases.

### Correctness
Given the above analysis, the program is not correct as it does not handle the general case where more than two stalls are needed and does not cover all possible scenarios for `n` and `k`.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
