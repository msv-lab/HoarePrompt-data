Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of vertices `n`, a number of chosen vertices `x`, and a list of `x` distinct vertices. It calculates and prints a result for each test case based on the gaps between the chosen vertices and their positions relative to the total number of vertices.**
