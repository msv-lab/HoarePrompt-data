Reasoning: 
The original assessment correctly identifies a significant flaw in the program. The program explicitly handles the cases for n = 1, 2, 3, and 4, but for n > 4, it outputs "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the correct checkerboard pattern. This behavior does not meet the problem's requirements, which specify that the program should handle all values of n between 1 and 20, inclusive.

The annotations provided show the state of the program before and after the function call, but they do not indicate any dynamic generation of the checkerboard pattern for n > 4. Instead, they show that the program falls into the `else` clause for n > 4, resulting in the incorrect output "No esta en el rango".

To be correct, the program should dynamically generate the checkerboard pattern for any value of n within the specified range. The current implementation only covers a few specific cases and fails to generalize to all possible inputs as required by the problem statement.

Final: **False**
