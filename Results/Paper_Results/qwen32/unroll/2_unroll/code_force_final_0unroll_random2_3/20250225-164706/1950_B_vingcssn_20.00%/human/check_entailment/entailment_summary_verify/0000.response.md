Reasoning: The original assessment is correct. The provided program only handles the specific cases where `n` is 1, 2, 3, or 4, as described in the function summary. For values of `n` outside this range (i.e., 5 to 20), the program prints "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the correct checkerboard pattern. This means the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, which states that it should handle all values of `n` from 1 to 20.

The function summary confirms that the program only has predefined patterns for `n` values of 1, 2, 3, and 4, and it does not generate the pattern dynamically for other values. Therefore, the program is indeed incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases within the specified range.

Final: **False**
