Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program only handles specific cases where `n` is 1, 2, 3, or 4. For any other value of `n` within the given range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), the program prints "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the correct checkerboard pattern. This means the program does not fulfill the requirements for all possible values of `n` as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
