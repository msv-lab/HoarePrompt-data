Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints a specific pattern of `#` and `.` characters based on the value of `n`. If `n` is 1, 2, 3, or 4, it prints predefined patterns. For any other value of `n`, it prints "No esta en el rango".**
