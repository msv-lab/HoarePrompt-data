Output State: **For each test case, the program will output either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions specified in the loop. The value of t, n, m, and the lists a1, l1, a2, l2, and others are not preserved after the loop execution as they are reinitialized in each iteration. The variable val is also reinitialized in each test case. The output state consists of a series of 'yes' or 'no' printed for each test case.**
