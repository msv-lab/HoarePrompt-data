The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not plan to use. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1.

Given that `t` is already defined as an integer value input by the user such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we don't need to adjust `t` itself, as it already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`t` is the integer value input by the user, such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
