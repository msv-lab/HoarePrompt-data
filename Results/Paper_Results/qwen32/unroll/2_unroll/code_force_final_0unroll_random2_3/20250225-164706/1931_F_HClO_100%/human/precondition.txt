test_cases is a list of test case descriptions. Each test case description is a list where the first element is a list of two integers [n, k] (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of chat participants and the number of participants who posted screenshots, respectively. The following k elements are lists of n integers each, where each list a_i represents the order of participants shown to the participant a_i0, with a_i0 being the author of the screenshot and always at the top of the list. All a_{ij} are different and within the range [1, n]. The sum of n · k for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
