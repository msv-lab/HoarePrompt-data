You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. Here are a few reasons why the code is incorrect:

1. **Misunderstanding of the Game Rules**:
   - The game involves two players taking turns. Anna reverses the digits of a single number, and Sasha concatenates two numbers.
   - The provided code does not simulate these turns or the strategic choices that each player might make.
   - The code only calculates the total length of the numbers after removing trailing zeros and then makes a decision based on whether this total length is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. This does not reflect the actual game mechanics.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Winning Condition**:
   - The code calculates the total length of the numbers after removing trailing zeros and compares this to `m + 1`. However, this is not the correct way to determine the winner.
   - The game ends when Sasha can no longer make a move, i.e., when there is only one number left in the list. Sasha wins if this number is not less than `10^m`.
   - The code does not simulate the concatenation of numbers by Sasha or the reversal of digits by Anna.

3. **Lack of Simulation of Game Turns**:
   - The code does not simulate the turns taken by Anna and Sasha. It directly calculates a value and makes a decision based on it.
   - This approach does not account for the optimal plays by both players, which is essential to determine the winner.

4. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   - The code does not handle cases where the list has only one number initially.
   - It does not handle cases where all numbers are single-digit or have leading zeros that can be removed.

To correctly implement the solution, one would need to simulate the game turns, taking into account the optimal moves by both Anna and Sasha. This would involve more complex logic than simply calculating the total length of the numbers after removing trailing zeros.

Given these issues, the provided code is incorrect.
