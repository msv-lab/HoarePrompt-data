Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game. The function `func_1` calculates the total length of the numbers in the list and subtracts the count of trailing zeros from every other number starting from the one with the most trailing zeros. It then checks if the resulting total length is greater than or equal to `m + 1` to decide the winner. However, this approach does not consider the optimal moves that both players can make during the game.

The game involves strategic choices by both players, and the outcome depends on how they play optimally. The current program does not simulate the turns and the strategic choices made by both players. It only calculates a value based on the initial list and does not take into account the concatenation and digit reversal operations that can change the outcome significantly.

Thus, the program is incorrect for the given problem description.
