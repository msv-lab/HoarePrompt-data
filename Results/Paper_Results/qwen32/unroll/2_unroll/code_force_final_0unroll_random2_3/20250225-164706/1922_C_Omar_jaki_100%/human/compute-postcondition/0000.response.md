The provided code snippet defines a lambda function `r` that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and converts each component to an integer. This lambda function is not used in the provided snippet, so no variables are directly modified or assigned new values based on the given code. The initial state conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a[1] < a[2] < ... < a[n] <= 10^9. `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^5, and for each query, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x, y <= n and x != y. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For every city, the closest city is determined uniquely. `r` is a lambda function that maps input to a list of integers.**
