Reasoning: 
The program is intended to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure that he has at least one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') for each of the `m` rounds. 

However, there are a few issues with the provided code:
1. The function `default_value` is referenced but not defined anywhere in the code. This will result in a `NameError`.
2. The logic for calculating the number of additional problems needed is flawed. The code currently adds the difference between `m` and the count of each problem type to `ans` only if the count is less than or equal to `m`. This is incorrect because Vlad needs at least `m` problems of each type, not just up to `m`. Therefore, the condition should be `d[val] < m` instead of `d[val] <= m`.
3. The function `func_1` is defined but never used in the program, and it always returns 0, which is not relevant to the task at hand.

Given these issues, the program as it stands will not correctly compute the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create. The `default_value` function needs to be defined, and the condition for calculating `ans` needs to be corrected.

Correctness: **False**
