You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(default_value)
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    d['A'] = 0
    d['B'] = 0
    d['C'] = 0
    d['D'] = 0
    d['E'] = 0
    d['F'] = 0
    d['G'] = 0
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] = d[s[i]] + 1
    ans = 0
    for val in d.keys():
        if d[val] <= m:
            ans = ans + m - d[val]
    print(ans)

def func_1():
    return 0



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and always returns 0, regardless of any input data.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create. Let's analyze why:

1. **Default Value Function**: The function `default_value()` is referenced in the `defaultdict` but is not defined in the provided code. This will cause a `NameError`.

2. **Logic for Counting Additional Problems**:
   - The program incorrectly counts the number of additional problems needed. It should determine the number of each problem level that is insufficient and then sum up the required additional problems for each level.
   - The current logic adds `m - d[val]` for every problem level `val` if `d[val] <= m`. This means it incorrectly adds additional problems even for levels that already have more than `m` problems.

### Correct Approach:
- For each problem level, if the count of that level is less than `m`, then the number of additional problems needed for that level is `m - d[val]`.
- Sum these values across all levels to get the total number of additional problems required.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
10 2
BGECDCBDED
```
- The program will incorrectly calculate the additional problems needed because it adds `m - d[val]` for all levels, even those that already have more than `m` problems.
- For example, level 'B' appears 2 times, which is equal to `m`, but the program will still add `2 - 2 = 0` for level 'B', which is correct, but it will incorrectly add additional problems for other levels.

### Corrected Code:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

def default_value():
    return 0

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(default_value)
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    for val in 'ABCDEFG':
        if d[val] < m:
            ans += m - d[val]
    print(ans)
```

In the corrected code, the function `default_value()` is defined, and the logic correctly calculates the number of additional problems needed for each level that is insufficient.
