In the provided loop, the loop head only involves the variable `_` and the function `input()`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `input()`, which is expected to be an integer representing the number of test cases (`t`). The variables `n` and the sequence `p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1}` are used inside the loop body, which we are not concerned with for this task.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that the input to the loop (i.e., the value of `t`) is at least 1. Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3**.

Since the loop head does not directly involve `n` or the sequence `p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1}`, we do not need to adjust those for the loop to start executing. They are relevant for the loop body but not for the loop initialization.
