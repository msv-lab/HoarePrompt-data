You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

    #State: The output state consists of `t` lines, each corresponding to the result of a test case. Each line contains either 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether the array `a` can be split into two parts such that the first part is non-decreasing and the second part is also non-decreasing, with the first element of the array being greater than or equal to all elements in the second part.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding
We need to determine whether we can sort the array in non-decreasing order by performing zero or more operations where an operation consists of splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and swapping these two parts.

### Program Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Checking if the Array is Already Sorted:**
   - The program first checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the condition `all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`. If true, it prints 'YES'.

3. **Checking for Possible Swaps:**
   - If the array is not already sorted, the program iterates over possible split points `i` (from 1 to n-1).
   - For each split point `i`, it checks two conditions:
     1. `all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])`: This checks if the first element of the original array `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in the suffix `new` (i.e., `a[i:]`).
     2. `all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])`: This checks if the suffix `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop.

### Issues in the Program
- The program does not correctly handle all cases where the array can be sorted by a single swap. 
- Specifically, the program only checks if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to all elements in the suffix, which is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted by a single swap.
- The program should check if there exists a point `i` such that the prefix `a[:i]` is in non-decreasing order, the suffix `a[i:]` is in non-decreasing order, and the last element of the prefix is less than or equal to the first element of the suffix.

### Correctness
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
