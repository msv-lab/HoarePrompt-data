Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine whether the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the allowed operation any number of times. The logic for checking the array after a split is flawed.

Here's an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
1
5
3 4 5 1 2
```

The program will check if the array is already sorted, which it is not. Then it will try to find a split point where the array can be split into two parts such that the first element of the array is greater than the next element. At the split point `i=3`, `a[2] > a[3]` (5 > 1), and it will check if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in the new array `new = [1, 2]` and if `new` is sorted. Since `a[0]` (3) is not greater than or equal to `new[0]` (1), it will print 'NO' and break out of the loop. However, the correct answer should be 'YES' because we can split the array at `i=3` to get `x=[3, 4, 5]` and `y=[1, 2]`, and after swapping, we get `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, which is sorted.

The program should correctly check for any possible split point where the array can be split into two parts such that the second part concatenated with the first part results in a sorted array. The current implementation does not account for all possible valid splits.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Find the point where the array stops being sorted
        i = 0
        while i < n - 1 and a[i] <= a[i + 1]:
            i += 1
        # If the array is already sorted
        if i == n - 1:
            print('YES')
            continue
        # Try to find a valid split point
        j = i + 1
        while j < n - 1 and a[j] <= a[j + 1]:
            j += 1
        # Check if the array can be sorted by swapping the two parts
        if j == n - 1 and a[i] <= a[0]:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version checks for the first point where the array stops being sorted and then checks if the rest of the array is sorted. It also ensures that the last element of the first part is less than or equal to the first element of the second part after the swap.
