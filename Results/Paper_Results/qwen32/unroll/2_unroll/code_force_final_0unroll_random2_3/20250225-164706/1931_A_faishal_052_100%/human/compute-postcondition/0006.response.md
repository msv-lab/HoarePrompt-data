Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `t` and `n`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78. The function returns a value for each test case based on the value of `n`.**
