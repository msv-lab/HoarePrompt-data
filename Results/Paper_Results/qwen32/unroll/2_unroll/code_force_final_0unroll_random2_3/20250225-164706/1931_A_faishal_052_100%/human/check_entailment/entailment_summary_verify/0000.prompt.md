You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    info = []
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex < 28:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            elif lex <= 78:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        info.append(arr)
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        print(temp)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `cases` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` and processes it to derive three integers. These integers are then converted to characters (assuming a 1-based index for letters 'a' to 'z') and printed as a string of three characters.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- The program should find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 lowercase Latin letters that could have been encoded to a given integer `n`.
- The integer `n` is the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet.
- The program should handle multiple test cases.

### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
- It then attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest word by distributing the value of `n` across three letters.
- The logic for constructing the word seems flawed:
  - It only considers two cases for the first two letters and then assigns the remaining value to the third letter.
  - It does not ensure that the constructed word is lexicographically smallest in all cases.
  - The sorting step does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest order.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not correctly distribute the value of `n` to ensure the lexicographically smallest word.
- The sorting step after appending the values does not guarantee the correct order.

### Example to Test:
Let's consider the case where `n = 55`:
- The correct lexicographically smallest word is `czz` because `3 + 26 + 26 = 55`.
- The program might not correctly handle this case because it does not distribute the values in a way that ensures the smallest possible letters first.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and might not produce the lexicographically smallest word for all values of `n`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The program does not correctly distribute the value of `n` to ensure the lexicographically smallest word in all cases. For example, with `n = 55`, the program might not output `czz` as expected.
