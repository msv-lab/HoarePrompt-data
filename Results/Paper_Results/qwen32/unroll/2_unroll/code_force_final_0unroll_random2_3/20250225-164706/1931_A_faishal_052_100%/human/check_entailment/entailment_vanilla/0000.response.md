Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to read each encoded integer `n`.

2. **Logic for Decoding:**
   - For each encoded integer `n`, the program is supposed to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to `n`.
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` and then iterates twice to determine the values of the first two letters.
   - The logic for determining the first two letters is flawed:
     - If `lex < 28`, it assigns `1` to the list and subtracts `1` from `lex`. This is correct for the first letter but not for the second.
     - If `lex < 52`, it assigns `26` to the list and subtracts `26` from `lex`. This is incorrect because it should handle the second letter, not the third.
     - If `lex <= 78`, it again assigns `26` to the list and subtracts `26` from `lex`. This is also incorrect for the same reason.
   - The last letter is then assigned the remaining value of `lex`.
   - The list `arr` is then sorted, which is incorrect because sorting the letters does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word if the first letters are not correctly determined.

3. **Output Generation:**
   - The program converts each value in `arr` to its corresponding letter and concatenates them to form the word.
   - It prints the resulting word for each test case.

### Issues in the Program

- The logic for determining the first two letters is flawed. The program should ensure that the first letter is the smallest possible while still allowing the remaining two letters to sum up to the remaining value.
- Sorting the list of letters does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word if the first letters are not correctly determined.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Iterate over possible values for the first letter (from 1 to 26).
2. For each value of the first letter, iterate over possible values for the second letter (from 1 to 26).
3. Calculate the value for the third letter as `n - (first_letter + second_letter)`.
4. Check if the third letter is valid (i.e., between 1 and 26).
5. Keep track of the lexicographically smallest word found.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for each encoded integer `n`. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
