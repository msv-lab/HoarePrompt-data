You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    info = []
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex < 28:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            elif lex <= 78:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        info.append(arr)
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        print(temp)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `cases` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` and processes it to derive three integers. These integers are then converted to characters (assuming a 1-based index for letters 'a' to 'z') and printed as a string of three characters.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
- We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that could have been encoded to a given integer `n`.
- The encoding is done by summing the positions of the letters in the alphabet (a=1, ..., z=26).
- The program should handle multiple test cases.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the encoded integer `lex`.

2. **Generating the Word:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` for each test case.
   - It then enters a loop that runs twice to determine the first two letters.
     - If `lex < 28`, it assigns `1` to the current position in `arr` and subtracts `1` from `lex`.
     - If `lex < 52`, it assigns `26` to the current position in `arr` and subtracts `26` from `lex`.
     - If `lex <= 78`, it again assigns `26` to the current position in `arr` and subtracts `26` from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it assigns the remaining value of `lex` to the third position in `arr`.
   - It sorts `arr` to ensure the lexicographically smallest order.

3. **Converting to Letters:**
   - For each test case, the program converts the values in `arr` to their corresponding letters by adding `96` (since `chr(97)` is 'a').
   - It concatenates these letters to form the word and prints it.

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic for determining the first two letters is flawed. The program does not correctly account for the smallest possible values for the first two letters.
- The sorting step is unnecessary because the letters should be determined in a way that ensures the smallest possible lexicographical order from the start.
- The program does not handle the edge cases correctly, especially when `lex` is near the minimum or maximum possible values.

### Correct Approach:
- Start by assigning the smallest possible values to the first two letters (e.g., 'a' or 'b') and then calculate the third letter based on the remaining sum.
- Ensure that the sum of the three letters equals `lex`.
- The program should ensure that the letters are in the smallest possible lexicographical order.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded integer. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
