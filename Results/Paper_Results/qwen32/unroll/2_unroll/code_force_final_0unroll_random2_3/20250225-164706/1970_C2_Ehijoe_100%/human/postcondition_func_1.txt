The function reads input to construct a tree represented by a dictionary of nodes and their neighbors, identifies the leaf nodes, and then determines the starting node from user input. It uses an auxiliary function `func_1` to compute some moves starting from the given node. Based on the result from `func_1`, it prints either 'Ron' or 'Hermione'.
