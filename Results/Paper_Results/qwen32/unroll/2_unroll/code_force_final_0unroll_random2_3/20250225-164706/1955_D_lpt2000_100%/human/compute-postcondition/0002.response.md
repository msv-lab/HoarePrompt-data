To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand what the loop does in each iteration and how it affects the variables.

### Loop Breakdown:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - For each iteration, `n`, `m`, `k` are read.
   - Two lists `aa` and `bb` are read, each containing `n` and `m` elements respectively.

2. **Counters Initialization:**
   - `cnt_aa` is a counter for the first `m` elements of `aa`.
   - `cnt_bb` is a counter for all elements of `bb`.

3. **Intersection Calculation:**
   - `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, representing common elements and their counts.
   - `pairs_in_D` is the total count of these common elements.
   - `E` is the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`, representing elements in `aa` that are not in `bb`.
   - `C` is the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`, representing elements in `bb` that are not in `aa`.

4. **Initial Check:**
   - `fnd` is set to 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0.

5. **Sliding Window:**
   - The loop slides a window of size `m` over `aa` from the `m`-th element to the end.
   - For each element sliding out of the window (`out_aa`), update `D`, `E`, `C`, and `pairs_in_D`.
   - For each element sliding into the window (`in_aa`), update `D`, `E`, `C`, and `pairs_in_D`.
   - Increment `fnd` if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`.

6. **Output:**
   - After the sliding window completes, `fnd` is printed, representing the number of times the condition `pairs_in_D >= k` was met.

### Output State:

The loop processes each test case independently and prints the value of `fnd` for each test case. Since `fnd` is the count of times the condition `pairs_in_D >= k` is met during the sliding window process, the output state will be a series of integers, each corresponding to a test case.

### Final Output State:

Since the loop processes `t` test cases, the output state will be a list of `t` integers, each representing the value of `fnd` for the respective test case.

Output State: **A list of `t` integers where each integer represents the number of times the condition `pairs_in_D >= k` was met for each test case.**
