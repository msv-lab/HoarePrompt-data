Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` such that 1 <= k <= m <= n, and two lists `a` and `b` of sizes `n` and `m` respectively, where each element in `a` and `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^6. The function processes these inputs and returns a specific output for each test case.**
