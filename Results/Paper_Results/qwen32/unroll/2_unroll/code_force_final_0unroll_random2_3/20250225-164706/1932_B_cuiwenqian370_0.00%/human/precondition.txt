path is a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers representing the periodicities of the signs for a test case. The outer list contains t test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, the first element is an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) representing the number of signs, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs.
