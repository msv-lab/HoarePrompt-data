Postcondition: **`path` is a list (or string) of characters, and `n` is the length of `path`, with `n` greater than 1. If the first character of `path` is `@`, then `dp` is a list of zeros with length `n`, except `dp[0]` is 1. If the second character of `path` is `*`, `dp[1]` is `-float('inf')`; otherwise, `dp[1]` is 1 if the second character of `path` is `@`, otherwise `dp[1]` is 0. If the first character of `path` is `*`, then `dp` is a list where the first element is `-float('inf')` and the rest are zeros. If the second character of `path` is `*`, `dp[1]` is `-float('inf')`; otherwise, `dp[1]` is 0 if the second character of `path` is `@`, otherwise `dp[1]` is 0. If the first character of `path` is neither `@` nor `*`, then `dp` remains a list of zeros, except `dp[1]` is 1 if the second character of `path` is `@`, otherwise `dp[1]` is 0.**
