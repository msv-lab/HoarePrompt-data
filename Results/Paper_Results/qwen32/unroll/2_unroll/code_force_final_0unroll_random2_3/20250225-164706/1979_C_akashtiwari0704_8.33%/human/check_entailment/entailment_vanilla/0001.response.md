Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to distribute the bets such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the multipliers `a`.

2. **Calculating the Product:**
   - The program calculates the product `prod` of all multipliers `a[i]`.
   - This product is intended to be used to compute the bets for each outcome.

3. **Calculating Bets:**
   - For each outcome `i`, the program sets `a[i]` to `prod // a[i]`.
   - This is an attempt to distribute the bets such that the total of these bets is less than the amount received for each winning outcome.
   - The sum of these bets is then computed and stored in `sumo`.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - If `sumo` (total of the bets) is greater than or equal to `prod`, the program prints `-1`, indicating it's not possible to distribute the bets as required.
   - Otherwise, it prints the bets.

### Issues with the Program:

- **Incorrect Calculation of Bets:**
  - The program calculates each bet as `prod // a[i]`. This does not guarantee that the total of these bets will be strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome.
  - For example, if `a = [3, 2, 7]`, `prod = 42`, and the bets calculated are `[14, 21, 6]`, the total is `41`, which is less than `42`, but this is not guaranteed for all cases.
  - The program does not ensure that `sumo < prod // a[i]` for each `i`.

- **Output Formatting:**
  - The program correctly formats the output by joining the bets with spaces, but this is not the main issue.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the total of the bets is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome. One simple and correct way to do this is to set each bet `x_i` to `1` and check if `n < k_i` for all `i`. If this condition is met, it's possible to distribute the bets as required; otherwise, it's not.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly ensure that the total of the bets is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
