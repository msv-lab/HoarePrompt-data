Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a list `k` of `n` integers. It calculates a product of the integers in `k`, then computes a new list where each element is the product divided by the corresponding element in `k`. It checks if the sum of this new list is greater than or equal to the product. If it is, the function outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs the new list of computed values, separated by spaces.**
