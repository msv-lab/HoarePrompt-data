### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program.

**Problem Recap:**
- We need to distribute bets such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.
- For each outcome \(i\), if it wins, we receive \(k_i \times \text{bet}_i\) coins back.
- The total of all bets must be strictly less than \(k_i \times \text{bet}_i\) for every \(i\).

**Program Analysis:**

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of outcomes and their respective multipliers.

2. **Calculating the Product:**
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers. This product is used to compute the bets for each outcome.

3. **Calculating Bets:**
   - For each outcome, the program calculates the bet as `prod // a[i]`, where `prod` is the product of all multipliers and `a[i]` is the multiplier for the \(i\)-th outcome.
   - The program then sums these bets to check if the total is less than `prod`.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - If the sum of the bets is greater than or equal to the product, the program outputs `-1`, indicating it's not possible to distribute the bets as required.
   - Otherwise, it outputs the computed bets.

**Evaluation of the Program:**

- **Feasibility Check:**
  - The program checks if the sum of the bets is less than the product of all multipliers. However, this is not the correct condition to ensure that the total bets are less than the amount received for each winning outcome.
  - The correct condition should be that the sum of the bets is less than \(k_i \times \text{bet}_i\) for each \(i\).

- **Bet Calculation:**
  - The bets calculated as `prod // a[i]` do not necessarily satisfy the required condition. For example, if `a = [3, 2, 7]`, `prod = 42`, and the bets calculated are `[14, 21, 6]`, the total is `41`, which is less than `42`, but this does not guarantee that the total is less than `k_i \times \text{bet}_i` for each \(i\).

- **Correct Approach:**
  - A simpler and correct approach is to set each bet to `1` and check if `n < k_i` for all `i`. If this condition is met, it's possible to distribute the bets as required; otherwise, it's not.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly ensure that the total of the bets is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
