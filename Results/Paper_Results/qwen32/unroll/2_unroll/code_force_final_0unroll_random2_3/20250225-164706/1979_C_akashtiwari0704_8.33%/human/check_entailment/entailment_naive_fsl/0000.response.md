Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The main issue lies in the logic used to determine the bets.

The program calculates a product of all multipliers (`prod`) and then tries to distribute the bets by dividing the product by each multiplier. This approach does not guarantee that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Let's consider a simple example to demonstrate the problem:

**Input:**
```
1
3
3 2 7
```

**Expected Output:**
```
27 41 12
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Total bet: 27 + 41 + 12 = 80
- If the first outcome wins: 3 * 27 = 81 (which is > 80)
- If the second outcome wins: 2 * 41 = 82 (which is > 80)
- If the third outcome wins: 7 * 12 = 84 (which is > 80)

**Program Output:**
The program calculates `prod = 3 * 2 * 7 = 42` and then divides this product by each multiplier:
- `a[0] = 42 // 3 = 14`
- `a[1] = 42 // 2 = 21`
- `a[2] = 42 // 7 = 6`

Total bet: 14 + 21 + 6 = 41
- If the first outcome wins: 3 * 14 = 42 (which is > 41)
- If the second outcome wins: 2 * 21 = 42 (which is > 41)
- If the third outcome wins: 7 * 6 = 42 (which is > 41)

Although the program's output in this case happens to be correct, it does not generalize to all cases. The program does not ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome in all scenarios.

For example, consider another input:

**Input:**
```
1
2
2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 1
```

**Program Output:**
The program calculates `prod = 2 * 2 = 4` and then divides this product by each multiplier:
- `a[0] = 4 // 2 = 2`
- `a[1] = 4 // 2 = 2`

Total bet: 2 + 2 = 4
- If the first outcome wins: 2 * 2 = 4 (which is not > 4)
- If the second outcome wins: 2 * 2 = 4 (which is not > 4)

In this case, the program's output is incorrect because the total bet is not strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome.

Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
