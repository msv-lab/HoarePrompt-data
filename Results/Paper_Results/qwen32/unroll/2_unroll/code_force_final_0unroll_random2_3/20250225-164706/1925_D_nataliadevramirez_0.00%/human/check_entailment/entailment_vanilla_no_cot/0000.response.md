Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The main issue lies in the calculation of the expected value for each friendship.

The program multiplies the initial friendship value `f` by the sum of the first `k` natural numbers (`k * (k + 1) // 2`), which is incorrect. This sum represents the total increase in friendship value for a pair if they are chosen in every excursion, but it does not account for the probability of choosing each pair.

The correct approach involves calculating the expected increase in the friendship value for each pair based on the probability of being chosen. The probability of choosing a specific pair in one excursion is `1 / C(n, 2)`, where `C(n, 2)` is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n`. The expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in `k` excursions is `k / C(n, 2)`. The expected increase in the friendship value for a pair with initial value `f` is then `f * (k / C(n, 2))`.

The expected total sum of friendship values is the sum of these expected increases for all pairs, which should then be converted to a fraction and reduced modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def mod_inverse(a, m):
    m0, x0, x1 = m, 0, 1
    if m == 1:
        return 0
    while a > 1:
        q = a // m
        m, a = a % m, m
        x0, x1 = x1 - q * x0, x0
    if x1 < 0:
        x1 += m0
    return x1

def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
    expected_sum = 0
    for a, b, f in friendships:
        expected_increase = f * k * mod_inverse(total_pairs, MOD)
        expected_sum = (expected_sum + expected_increase) % MOD
    return expected_sum

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        friendships = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        print(result)

# Uncomment the following line to run the function with input
# func_2()
```

This corrected version properly calculates the expected increase in the friendship value for each pair and sums these values to get the final result.
