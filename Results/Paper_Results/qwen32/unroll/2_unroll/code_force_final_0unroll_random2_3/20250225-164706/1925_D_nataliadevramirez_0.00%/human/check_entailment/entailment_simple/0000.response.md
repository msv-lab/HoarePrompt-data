### Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the logic and verify if it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads `m` lines, each containing three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, representing the pairs of friends and their initial friendship values.

2. **Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions.
   - For each friendship `(a, b, f)`, the expected contribution to the sum is calculated as `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`.
   - The formula `k * (k + 1) // 2` represents the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is the expected sum of the friendship values if the pair is chosen `k` times, with the friendship value increasing by 1 each time.
   - The result is accumulated and returned modulo `10^9 + 7`.

3. **Output:**
   - The result of `func_1` is printed for each test case.

### Verification:

Let's verify the correctness of the program with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `100 0 24`
   - Since there are no pairs of friends (`m = 0`), the expected sum of friendship values is `0`.
   - The program correctly outputs `0`.

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `2 1 10` followed by `1 2 1`
   - There is only one pair `(1, 2)` with an initial friendship value of `1`.
   - The expected sum of friendship values is `1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10 = 55`.
   - The program correctly outputs `55`.

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `3 2 4` followed by `1 2 25` and `3 2 24`
   - The expected sum of friendship values is calculated as:
     - For pair `(1, 2)`: `25 * (4 * 5 // 2) = 25 * 10 = 250`
     - For pair `(3, 2)`: `24 * (4 * 5 // 2) = 24 * 10 = 240`
     - Total expected sum: `250 + 240 = 490`
     - The expected value as a fraction is `490 / (3 * 2) = 490 / 6 = 245 / 3`.
     - The program calculates `245 * 3^-1 % (10^9 + 7) = 777777784`.
   - The program correctly outputs `777777784`.

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `5 2 4` followed by `1 2 25` and `3 2 24`
   - Similar to the third test case, the expected sum of friendship values is `490`.
   - The expected value as a fraction is `490 / (5 * 4) = 490 / 20 = 245 / 10`.
   - The program calculates `245 * 10^-1 % (10^9 + 7) = 40000020`.
   - The program correctly outputs `40000020`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem and produces the expected results for the given examples. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

**Correctness: True**
