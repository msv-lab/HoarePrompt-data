### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying the issues with the provided program. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**:
   - The program calculates the contribution of each friendship pair by multiplying the initial friendship value `f` by the sum of the first `k` natural numbers (`k * (k + 1) // 2`). This assumes that each pair of friends will be chosen `k` times, which is incorrect.
   - The correct approach involves calculating the expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in `k` excursions, which is `k / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`. The expected contribution of each friendship pair to the total sum should be `f * (k / (n * (n - 1) / 2))`.

2. **Increasing Friendship Values**:
   - The program does not account for the fact that the friendship values increase by 1 each time a pair is chosen. The expected value calculation should consider the increasing friendship values over the `k` excursions.
   - The expected contribution of a friendship pair should be calculated by summing the expected values for each possible number of times the pair is chosen, taking into account the increasing friendship values.

3. **Counterexample**:
   - The provided counterexample illustrates the issue:
     ```
     1
     3 1 2
     1 2 1
     ```
   - The expected output is `3`, not `333333338` as produced by the program.
   - The detailed explanation in the original assessment correctly shows why the program's output is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaws in the provided program. The program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions due to the incorrect handling of the friendship values and the probability of choosing specific pairs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
