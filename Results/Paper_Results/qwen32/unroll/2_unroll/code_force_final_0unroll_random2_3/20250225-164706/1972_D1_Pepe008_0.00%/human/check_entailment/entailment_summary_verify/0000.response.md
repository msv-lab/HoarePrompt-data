### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if the original assessment is accurate or inaccurate.

#### Problem Analysis
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Program Analysis
The provided program does the following:
1. Reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
3. Initializes `suma` to 0.
4. Iterates \(i\) from 1 to \(b\) (which should be \(m\)).
5. Calculates \(x\) as \(\left\lfloor \frac{a - i(i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1\).
6. If \(a - i(i - 1) > 0\), it adds \(x\) to `suma`.
7. Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

#### Issues in the Program
The original assessment points out several issues:
1. **Incorrect Iteration**: The loop `for i in range(1, b + 1):` should iterate over \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) and \(b\) from 1 to \(m\). The current code incorrectly fixes \(b\) and iterates over \(i\).
2. **Incorrect Condition**: The calculation of `x` and the condition `if a - i * (i - 1) > 0` do not correctly implement the logic to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's examine the logic in detail:

The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be written as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) \]
for some integer \(k\). This simplifies to:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
\[ a = (k - 1) \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]

The program's logic does not align with this condition. The loop and the calculation of `x` do not correctly reflect the requirement to check the condition for all pairs \((a, b)\).

#### Example Verification
Let's verify the provided example:
- For \(n = 2, m = 3\):
  - Valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).
  - The program's logic does not correctly identify these pairs.

Given these issues, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the condition.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
