### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's break down the program and the logic behind it:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Logic for Counting Valid Pairs**:
   - The commented out section shows a brute-force approach, which would be inefficient given the constraints (\(n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\)).
   - The actual logic implemented is optimized and uses mathematical insights to count the valid pairs efficiently.

3. **Mathematical Insight**:
   - The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten using the properties of gcd.
   - Let \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then \(a = dx\) and \(b = dy\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
   - The condition becomes \(dx + dy\) is a multiple of \(dy \cdot d\), simplifying to \(x + y\) is a multiple of \(y\).
   - This implies \(x\) must be a multiple of \(y\). Let \(x = ky\). Then \(a = dky\) and \(b = dy\).
   - The constraints \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\) translate to \(1 \le dky \le n\) and \(1 \le dy \le m\).

4. **Implementation Details**:
   - The program iterates over possible values of `i` (which corresponds to `y` in the above explanation).
   - For each `i`, it calculates the number of valid `a` values that satisfy the conditions.
   - The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` counts the number of multiples of `i` up to `a - i * (i - 1)`.
   - The `suma` variable accumulates the count of valid pairs.
   - Finally, `suma - 1` is printed for each test case.

5. **Verification Against Example**:
   - The program's output matches the expected output for the provided examples, suggesting that the logic is correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the optimized logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case, and it efficiently handles the given constraints.

**Correctness: True**
