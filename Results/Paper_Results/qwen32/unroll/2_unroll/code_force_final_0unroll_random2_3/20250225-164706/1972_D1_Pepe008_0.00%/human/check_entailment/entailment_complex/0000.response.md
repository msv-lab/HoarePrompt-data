### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions for multiple test cases. The conditions are:

1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The program reads multiple test cases and, for each test case, calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) using a specific formula. The formula is derived based on the conditions given and is implemented in the nested loops and calculations within the code.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases \(T\) and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Formula Calculation**:
   - For each test case, it initializes `suma` to 0.
   - It then iterates over possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates \(x\) as \(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\) and adds this value to `suma` if \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\).
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 1` as the result for that test case.

The formula used seems to be a mathematical optimization to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) without explicitly checking each pair, which would be computationally expensive given the constraints.

The commented-out section of the code provides a brute-force approach to verify the conditions for each pair \((a, b)\). However, this brute-force approach is not used in the actual implementation, and the program relies on the derived formula.

Given the constraints and the provided formula, the program should correctly compute the number of valid pairs for each test case.

### Correctness:

Based on the provided logic and the fact that the formula seems to be an optimized solution to the problem, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
