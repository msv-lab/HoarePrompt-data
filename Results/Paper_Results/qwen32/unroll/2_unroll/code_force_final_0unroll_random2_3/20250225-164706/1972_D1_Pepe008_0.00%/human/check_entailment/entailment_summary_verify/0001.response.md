Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Code Analysis
The provided program uses a different approach compared to a brute-force method that checks every pair \((a, b)\).

#### Key Parts of the Code:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(T\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Logic to Calculate Valid Pairs:**
   - The program iterates over possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates a value \(x\) using the formula:
     \[
     x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1
     \]
     where \(i\) is the current value of \(b\).
   - If \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\), it adds \(x\) to the sum.
   - Finally, it subtracts 1 from the sum and prints the result.

### Function Summary Analysis
The function summary states that the function processes multiple test cases, calculates a result based on a specific formula involving \(a\) and \(b\), and prints the result after adjusting by subtracting one. This summary does not provide insight into the correctness of the formula used or the logic behind it.

### Correctness Evaluation
To determine if the program is correct, we need to verify if the formula and logic used correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the problem's conditions.

#### Issues with the Provided Program:
- **Formula Derivation:** The formula used to calculate the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(b\) is not derived from the problem's condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- **Logic Mismatch:** The logic in the program does not directly check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for each pair \((a, b)\).

#### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is satisfied. Here is a simplified version of the correct approach:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

# Uncomment the following line to run the function
# func()
```

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. The formula and logic used do not ensure that the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) is accurately counted.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
