Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of two integers, `a` and `b`, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. The function does not accept any parameters directly. For each test case, the function determines and returns whether Alice has more coins than Bob, Bob has more coins than Alice, or they have the same number of coins.**
