### Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze the game mechanics and the strategy derived from the problem description. The original assessment states that the game's outcome is determined by the parity (odd or even) of the absolute difference between the number of coins Alice and Bob have. Let's delve deeper into this reasoning:

1. **Game Mechanics and Strategy:**
   - Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first.
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets or not, and then must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The game ends when a player cannot make a move (i.e., both wallets have 0 coins).

2. **Parity Analysis:**
   - If the absolute difference between the number of coins (`abs(a - b)`) is even, Bob can always force a win.
     - This is because Bob can mirror Alice's moves. If Alice swaps, Bob swaps; if Alice doesn't swap, Bob doesn't swap. Since the difference is even, Bob can always ensure that Alice is the one left with no coins.
   - If the absolute difference (`abs(a - b)`) is odd, Alice can always force a win.
     - Alice can adjust her moves to ensure that Bob is the one left with no coins, given the odd difference.

3. **Program Logic:**
   - The provided program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - It then checks if the absolute difference between the coins is even or odd.
   - If the difference is even, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice".

The original assessment correctly identifies the key strategy: the parity of the difference between the number of coins determines the winner. The provided program implements this logic accurately. Here's the breakdown of the program based on the function summary:

- **Function Summary:**
  - The function reads multiple test cases from standard input.
  - For each test case, it reads two integers representing the number of coins Alice and Bob have.
  - It calculates the absolute difference between the coins.
  - It prints 'Bob' if the difference is even and 'Alice' if the difference is odd.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic needed to determine the winner based on the given rules and the derived strategy.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct according to the problem description and the optimal strategy derived.

Final: **True**
