### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the program to verify if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Game Rules and Strategy:**
   - Alice and Bob take turns.
   - They can choose to swap wallets or not.
   - After the choice, they must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The game ends when a player cannot make a move (i.e., both wallets have 0 coins).

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The game's outcome depends on the parity of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - If `abs(a - b)` is even, Bob can always force a win.
     - Bob can mirror Alice's moves to ensure Alice is the one left with no coins.
   - If `abs(a - b)` is odd, Alice can always force a win.
     - Alice can adjust her moves to ensure Bob is the one left with no coins.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `a` and `b`.
   - It calculates `abs(a - b)`.
   - If `abs(a - b)` is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If `abs(a - b)` is odd, it prints "Alice".

4. **Verification Using Annotations:**
   - The annotations confirm that the program processes each test case by reading `a` and `b`, calculates `abs(a - b)`, and prints "Bob" or "Alice" based on the parity of the difference.
   - The annotations state that after processing all test cases, the program prints the correct result for each test case based on the parity of the difference.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly implements the strategy analysis.
   - The annotations support this conclusion by showing the correct behavior at each step.

### Final Evaluation:
The provided program is correct according to the problem description and the optimal strategy derived.

Final: **True**
