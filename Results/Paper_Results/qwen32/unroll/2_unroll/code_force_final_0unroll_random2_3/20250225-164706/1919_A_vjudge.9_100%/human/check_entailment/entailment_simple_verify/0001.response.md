### Reasoning:
To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to verify if the logic aligns with the optimal strategy described in the problem. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Game Analysis:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns.
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets or not, and then must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move (i.e., both wallets are empty).
   - The optimal strategy is based on the parity (odd or even) of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

2. **Parity Strategy:**
   - If the absolute difference between the number of coins (`abs(a - b)`) is even, Bob can always force a win by mirroring Alice's moves.
     - Since the difference is even, Bob can always ensure that Alice is the one left with no coins.
   - If the absolute difference between the number of coins (`abs(a - b)`) is odd, Alice can always force a win.
     - Alice can adjust her moves to ensure that Bob is the one left with no coins, given the odd difference.

3. **Program Logic:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets (`a` and `b`).
   - It checks if the absolute difference (`abs(a - b)`) is even or odd.
   - If the difference is even, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice".

4. **Annotations and Evaluation:**
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after processing each test case.
   - The annotations confirm that the program correctly implements the logic of checking the parity of the difference and printing the appropriate winner based on that parity.

The annotations and the original assessment both support the idea that the program correctly implements the optimal strategy derived from the game analysis.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided annotations and the reasoning, the program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the parity of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

Final: **True**
