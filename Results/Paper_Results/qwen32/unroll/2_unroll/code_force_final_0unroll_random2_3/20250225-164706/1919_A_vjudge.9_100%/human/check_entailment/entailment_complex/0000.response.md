Reasoning:  
The problem revolves around determining the winner of a game based on the parity (odd or even) of the absolute difference between the number of coins Alice and Bob have. The key insight is that if the difference is even, Bob wins, and if it is odd, Alice wins. This is because the game essentially reduces to a parity game where the player starting with an odd difference can force a win by always maintaining an odd difference for the opponent.

The provided program correctly implements this logic. It reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, it reads the number of coins Alice and Bob have. It then calculates the absolute difference between the two numbers and checks if this difference is even or odd. Based on this check, it prints "Bob" if the difference is even and "Alice" if the difference is odd.

The logic is correct based on the problem description, and the program handles the input and output as specified. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
