Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of cards, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the integers on the cards. Each integer from 1 through `n` appears in the list at most 2 times. The function returns a result for each test case based on these inputs.**
