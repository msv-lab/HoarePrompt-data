To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, let's break down the provided Python code and understand what it does.

### Code Analysis:

1. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs for the number of test cases provided as input.
2. **Inner Loop**: For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`.
3. **Count Array**: It initializes a count array `cnt` of size `n + 1` to zero.
4. **Counting Occurrences**: It iterates over the list `a` and increments the count of each integer in the `cnt` array.
5. **Calculating Result**: It calculates the result `ans` by summing up the excess occurrences of each integer (i.e., `max(0, x - 1)` for each count `x` in `cnt`).
6. **Output**: It prints the result `ans` for each test case.

### What the Code Does:
For each test case, the code calculates the number of integers that appear more than once in the list `a` and sums up the excess occurrences.

### Output State:
The output state will be the results for each test case printed one by one. Each result represents the total number of excess occurrences of integers in the list `a` for that test case.

### Format:
The output state must be in the format: **Output State: the output state you calculate.**

### Example:
Let's consider an example with two test cases:
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 5`, `a = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]`
  - Count array `cnt = [0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0]`
  - Excess occurrences: `max(0, 0-1) + max(0, 1-1) + max(0, 2-1) + max(0, 1-1) + max(0, 1-1) + max(0, 0-1) = 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1`
- **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = [1, 1, 2]`
  - Count array `cnt = [0, 2, 1, 0]`
  - Excess occurrences: `max(0, 0-1) + max(0, 2-1) + max(0, 1-1) + max(0, 0-1) = 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 1`

**Output State: 1 1**

### General Output State:
The output state will be a sequence of integers, each representing the result for each test case.

Output State: **the sequence of results for each test case**.

Since the exact input is not provided, we describe the output state in terms of the results for each test case:

Output State: **the sequence of results for each test case**.
