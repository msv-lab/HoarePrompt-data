### Reasoning:
The program's logic is to calculate the maximum number of points you can get if you play optimally, given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. The key insight is that a point is scored whenever a player places a card with a number that is already on the table, meaning that the card number has appeared before.

The provided program counts the occurrences of each card number in your hand and calculates the number of duplicate cards (cards that appear more than once). The formula `max(0, x - 1)` for each card number `x` correctly computes the number of times you can score a point for that card number. This is because if a card number appears `x` times, you can score a point `x - 1` times (since the first occurrence doesn't score a point).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic with an example:
1. For each test case, read the number of cards `n` and the list of card numbers `a`.
2. Count the occurrences of each card number using a list `cnt` where `cnt[i]` is the number of times card number `i` appears in your hand.
3. For each card number `x` in `cnt`, add `max(0, x - 1)` to `ans`, which is the total points you can score for that card number.
4. Print the total points `ans` for each test case.

The program correctly implements this logic and the provided example outputs match the expected results based on the problem description.
