### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of points we can score in a card game against an opponent (Nene) who plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize ours. The key observation is that we score a point each time we play a card that already has a matching card on the table.

Given the constraints and the nature of the game, the optimal strategy for both players involves playing cards in such a way that we maximize our points while Nene minimizes them. However, the problem simplifies to counting the number of pairs of cards in our hand because each pair contributes exactly one point to our score when both cards are played.

The provided program correctly implements this logic. It counts the occurrences of each card in the input list and calculates the total number of pairs by summing up the maximum of zero or one less than the count of each card. This is because each pair contributes exactly one point.
