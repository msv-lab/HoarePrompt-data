Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Game Setup:**
   - There are `2n` cards, each with an integer from `1` to `n`.
   - Each integer from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice.
   - The cards are distributed such that both players receive `n` cards each.
   - Players take turns placing cards on a table, and a player receives a point if a card with the same number is already on the table.

2. **Objective:**
   - Determine the maximum number of points you can get if you play optimally.
   - Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - For each integer `x` that appears twice in your hand, you can get at most one point from it because you can only place one card of `x` on the table before Nene can place the second card.
   - If an integer appears only once in your hand, you cannot get a point from it because Nene will place the other card of the same number on the table before you can place yours.

### Program Analysis

The provided program calculates the maximum number of points you can get based on the following logic:

1. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - It counts the occurrences of each integer in your hand using a list `cnt` where `cnt[i]` represents the number of times integer `i` appears in your hand.

2. **Calculating Points:**
   - For each integer `x` that appears in your hand, the program calculates the number of points you can get as `max(0, cnt[x] - 1)`. This means:
     - If `cnt[x]` is `2`, you can get `1` point.
     - If `cnt[x]` is `1`, you cannot get any points.
     - If `cnt[x]` is `0`, it does not affect the calculation.

3. **Summing Points:**
   - The program sums up the points for all integers in your hand to get the total number of points you can get.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally. It correctly counts the occurrences of each integer in your hand and calculates the points based on the rules of the game.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
