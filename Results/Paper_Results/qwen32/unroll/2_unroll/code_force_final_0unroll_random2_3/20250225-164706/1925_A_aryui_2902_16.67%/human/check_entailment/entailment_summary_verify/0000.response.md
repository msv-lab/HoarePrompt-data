### Reasoning:

The original assessment is **correct**. The provided code does not generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - It returns a string consisting of the first `k` characters of the alphabet, repeated `n` times.
   
2. **Program Behavior**:
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the output is `"abcabc"`.
   - The possible subsequences of length 2 using the letters 'a', 'b', and 'c' are: "aa", "ab", "ac", "ba", "bb", "bc", "ca", "cb", "cc".
   - The string `"abcabc"` does not contain subsequences like "aa", "bb", or "cc".

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem, one needs to generate a de Bruijn sequence for the given alphabet size `k` and length `n`. A de Bruijn sequence is a cyclic sequence in which every possible string of length `n` appears as a subsequence.
   - The provided code does not implement such a sequence generation, hence it is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The given program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**
