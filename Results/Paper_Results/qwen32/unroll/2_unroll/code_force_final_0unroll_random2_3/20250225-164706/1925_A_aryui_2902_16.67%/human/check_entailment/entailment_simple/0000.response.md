Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by generating a string that contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. However, the approach taken in the function `func_1` is incorrect.

The function `func_1` simply takes the first `k` characters of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw' and repeats them `n` times. This does not guarantee that all possible subsequences of length `n` will be present as subsequences of the generated string.

For example, consider the test case `n = 2` and `k = 2`. The correct output should be `baab` or any other string that contains all subsequences `aa`, `ab`, `ba`, and `bb`. The output from the given program would be `aabb`, which does not contain `ba` as a subsequence.

The program needs to generate a De Bruijn sequence for the given `n` and `k`, which is a cyclic sequence in which every possible string of length `n` appears as a substring. However, the provided program does not implement this correctly.

Correctness: **False**
