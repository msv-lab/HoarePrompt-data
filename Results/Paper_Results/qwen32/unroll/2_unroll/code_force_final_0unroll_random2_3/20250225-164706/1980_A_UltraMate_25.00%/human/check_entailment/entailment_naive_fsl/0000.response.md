Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the problem description correctly because it does not consider the difficulty level 'G'. The problem description specifies that Vlad needs problems of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'. However, the program only checks for the presence of difficulties 'A' to 'F'.

To fix this, the string `p` should include 'G' as well, i.e., `p = 'ABCDEFG'`.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
1 1
G
```

**Expected Output:**
```
6
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

In this example, Vlad needs 6 more problems (one each of 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F') to hold 1 round, but the program incorrectly outputs 1, as it does not consider the missing difficulties 'A' to 'F'.
