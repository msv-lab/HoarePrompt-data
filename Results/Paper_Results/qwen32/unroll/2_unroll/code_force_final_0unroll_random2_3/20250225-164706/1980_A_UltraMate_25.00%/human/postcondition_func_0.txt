The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a string `a` of length `n` and an integer `m`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of additions needed to ensure that each of the characters 'A' to 'F' appears at least `m` times in the string. Characters 'G' and any missing characters from 'A' to 'F' are not considered in this count.
