In the given task, the for loop is defined as follows:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop head only involves the variable `t`, which determines how many times the loop will execute. 

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is the integer value provided by the input
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 5
- `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'

To ensure that the loop executes, we only need to adjust the state of `t`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `a` do not affect the execution of this specific loop.

Therefore, to make sure the loop executes at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. 

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 5, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'**
