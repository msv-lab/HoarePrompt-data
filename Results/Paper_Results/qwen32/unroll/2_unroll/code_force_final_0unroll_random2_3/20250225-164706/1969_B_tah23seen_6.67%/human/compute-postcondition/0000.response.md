The provided code snippet `s = []` initializes an empty list named `s`. This operation does not affect the initial state of `sChar`, which remains a list of strings where each string consists of only '0's and '1's, and the length of each string satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, the total length of all strings in `sChar` does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

Since `s` is newly initialized, it does not impact the existing state of `sChar`.

Output State: **sChar is a list of strings where each string consists of only '0's and '1's, and the length of each string satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5; s is an empty list**.
