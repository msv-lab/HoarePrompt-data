The provided Python code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`. Therefore, the initial state variables retain their values, and the only new variable `results` is an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters "U" and "D"; `results` is an empty list.**
