The code snippet creates a list `pre` that contains the indices (1-based) of all occurrences of the character '>' in the string `s1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `s1` remains a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where the character '>' appears in `s1`.**
