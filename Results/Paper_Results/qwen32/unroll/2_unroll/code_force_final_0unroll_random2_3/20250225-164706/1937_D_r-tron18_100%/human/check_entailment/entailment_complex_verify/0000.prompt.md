You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

Example

Input

    3
    
    ><<
    
    4
    
    <<<<
    
    6
    
    <><<<>

Output

    3 6 5 
    1 2 3 4 
    1 4 7 10 8 1 
    
Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers representing the time points at which the pinball leaves the grid from specific positions, and times is an integer representing the number of seconds or the index offset used to calculate the difference in times.
def func_1(arr, times):

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the described behavior for all possible inputs, including edge cases. The program is supposed to simulate the movement of a pinball in a grid based on the direction specified by the characters '<' and '>', and then output the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

Let's break down the program and see if it handles all the cases as expected.

### Key Points to Check:
1. **Correct Simulation of Pinball Movement**:
   - The pinball should move left if the character is '<' and right if the character is '>'.
   - After each move, the character should be inverted.
   - The pinball should stop when it leaves the grid (either the left or right border).

2. **Handling of Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program should handle multiple test cases, each with different grid lengths and configurations.

3. **Correct Calculation of Seconds**:
   - The program should correctly calculate the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

### Analysis of the Code:
The provided code uses a more optimized approach to solve the problem rather than simulating the pinball movement for each starting position individually. It uses prefix and suffix sums to calculate the number of seconds more efficiently. Let's see if it handles all the cases correctly.

#### Example Test Case Verification:
Let's verify the code with the provided example test cases.

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `"><<"` (n = 3)
   - Expected Output: `3 6 5`
   - The code should correctly simulate the movements and output the expected result.

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `"<<<<"` (n = 4)
   - Expected Output: `1 2 3 4`
   - The code should correctly simulate the movements and output the expected result.

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `"<><<<<"` (n = 6)
   - Expected Output: `1 4 7 10 8 1`
   - The code should correctly simulate the movements and output the expected result.

### Edge Cases:
- **All '<' or All '>'**:
  - For a grid filled with all '<' or all '>', the pinball should leave the grid in a predictable number of steps.
- **Single Cell Grid**:
  - For a grid with only one cell, the pinball should leave the grid in one step.
- **Alternating '<' and '>'**:
  - For a grid with alternating '<' and '>', the pinball should leave the grid in a specific pattern.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code and verifying it with the example test cases, it appears that the code correctly handles the movement of the pinball and calculates the number of seconds accurately. The use of prefix and suffix sums helps in efficiently solving the problem within the given constraints.

Therefore, based on the provided test cases and the logic of the code, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.

If there were any discrepancies or edge cases that the code failed to handle, they would have been identified during the analysis. Since no such cases were found, the code is considered correct.
