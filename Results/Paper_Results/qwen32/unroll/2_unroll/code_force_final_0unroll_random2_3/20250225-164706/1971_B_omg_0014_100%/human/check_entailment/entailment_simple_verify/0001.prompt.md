You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: The output state consists of printed results for each iteration of the loop, with each result being either 'NO' or 'YES' followed by the sorted or reverse sorted string `s` if 'YES' was printed. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
1. We need to take multiple test cases, each consisting of a string `s`.
2. For each string `s`, we need to determine if it's possible to rearrange its characters to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`.
3. If it's impossible to do so, we output "NO".
4. If it's possible, we output "YES" followed by a valid rearrangement of the string `s`.

### Key Observations:
- If the string `s` has all identical characters (i.e., all characters in `s` are the same), then no matter how we rearrange them, the resulting string will always be the same as `s`. Thus, we should output "NO" for such cases.
- If the string `s` has at least two different characters, we can always rearrange the string to get a new string that is not equal to `s`. We can sort the string in ascending or descending order and check if the sorted string is different from the original string. If it is, we can print that sorted string as our result.

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the provided program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
```

- **Line 1 (`n = int(input())`)**: This reads the number of test cases.
- **Line 2 (`for i in range(n):`)**: This loop processes each test case.
- **Line 3 (`s = input()`)**: This reads the string for the current test case.
- **Line 4 (`a = set(s)`)**: This creates a set of unique characters in the string `s`.
- **Line 5 (`if len(a) == 1:`)**: This checks if all characters in `s` are the same. If true, it prints "NO" because no rearrangement can result in a different string.
- **Line 8 (`b = ''.join(sorted(s))`)**: This sorts the string `s` in ascending order.
- **Line 9 (`c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))`)**: This sorts the string `s` in descending order.
- **Line 10 (`if b == s:`)**: This checks if the ascending sorted string is the same as the original string. If true, it prints the descending sorted string `c` as the rearranged string.
- **Line 12 (`else:`)**: If the ascending sorted string is different from the original string, it prints the ascending sorted string `b` as the rearranged string.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles both cases:
- If all characters are the same, it outputs "NO".
- If there are different characters, it outputs "YES" followed by a valid rearrangement of the string.

Thus, the program is correct.
