### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine if a given string can be rearranged to form a new string that is not equal to the original one. If the string consists of only one unique character, it is impossible to rearrange it to form a different string, so the program should output "NO". Otherwise, it should output "YES" and provide a rearranged version of the string.

The execution summary describes the program's behavior accurately:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads a string and checks the number of unique characters using a set.
- If the string has more than one unique character, it outputs "YES" and then either the lexicographically smallest or largest version of the string, depending on whether the original string is already the smallest.
- If the string has only one unique character, it outputs "NO".

The logic for determining whether a rearranged string is possible and providing a valid rearrangement is correct. The program ensures that the rearranged string is not identical to the original by selecting either the smallest or largest lexicographical order, which guarantees a different string when there are multiple unique characters.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
