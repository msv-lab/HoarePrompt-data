You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        if n == 1:
            print(k)
        else:
            arr = []
            k0 = k
            i = 0
            ans = []
            temp = 1
            while True:
                if temp * 2 < k:
                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:
                    break
            ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it outputs `n` integers. If `n` is 1, the output is `k`. Otherwise, the output starts with the largest power of 2 less than `k` minus 1, followed by the difference between `k` and this largest power of 2 minus 1, and then `n-2` zeros if necessary.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to generate a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers.

### Key Observations

1. **Maximizing 1s in Bitwise OR**: To maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of a set of numbers, we should try to set as many bits as possible to 1 across the numbers. 
2. **Sum Constraint**: The sum of these numbers must be exactly `k`.

### Program Analysis

The program provided does not correctly address the problem requirements. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Single Element Case**: The program correctly handles the case where `n == 1` by simply printing `k`.
2. **General Case**:
   - The program tries to find a power of 2 (`temp`) close to `k` but less than `k`.
   - It then uses `(1 << i) - 1` (which is a number with `i+1` bits set to 1) and appends `k - sum(ans)` to the list.
   - It fills the rest of the sequence with zeros.

### Issues with the Program

- **Incorrect Bitwise OR Maximization**: The program only uses one number with a large number of bits set to 1 and the rest zeros. This does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.
- **Inefficient Use of Numbers**: The program does not distribute the bits across multiple numbers effectively to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

### Correct Approach

To maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR, we should distribute the bits as evenly as possible across the numbers. Here's a high-level idea of how to do it:

1. **Distribute Bits**: Start with the highest bit positions and distribute them across the numbers.
2. **Ensure Sum Constraint**: Make sure the sum of the numbers equals `k`.

### Correctness Evaluation

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
