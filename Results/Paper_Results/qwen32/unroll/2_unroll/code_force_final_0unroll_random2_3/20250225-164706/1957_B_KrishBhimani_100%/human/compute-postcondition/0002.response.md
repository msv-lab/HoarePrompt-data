To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all iterations, we need to understand what the loop does for each test case. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. **Input Reading**: For each test case, the code reads two integers `n` and `k`.
2. **Special Case Handling**: If `n` is 1, it directly prints `k` and moves to the next test case.
3. **Array Construction**:
   - It initializes an empty list `arr` and a variable `temp` set to 1.
   - It calculates the largest power of 2 that is less than `k` and stores the corresponding exponent `i`.
   - It then constructs a list `ans` starting with `(1 << i) - 1` (which is `2^i - 1`).
   - It appends the difference `k - sum(ans)` to `ans`.
   - It pads `ans` with zeros until its length is `n`.
4. **Output**: It prints the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.

The loop processes each test case independently, so the output state after all iterations will be the concatenated results of each test case's output.

Given the initial state, the output state will be a series of lines, each corresponding to the output of one test case. Each line will contain `n` integers separated by spaces, as described by the logic above.

Therefore, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **For each test case with integers `n` and `k`, the output is a line containing `n` integers. If `n` is 1, the output is `k`. Otherwise, the output starts with the largest power of 2 less than `k` minus 1, followed by the difference `k - (largest power of 2 less than k - 1)`, and then `n-2` zeros if necessary.**
