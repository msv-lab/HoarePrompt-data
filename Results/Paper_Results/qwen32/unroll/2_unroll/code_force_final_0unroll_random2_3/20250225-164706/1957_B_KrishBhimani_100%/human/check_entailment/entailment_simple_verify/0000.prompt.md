You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        if n == 1:
            print(k)
        else:
            arr = []
            k0 = k
            i = 0
            ans = []
            temp = 1
            while True:
                if temp * 2 < k:
                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:
                    break
            ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)

            print(*ans)
        
    #State: For each test case with integers `n` and `k`, the output is a line containing `n` integers. If `n` is 1, the output is `k`. Otherwise, the output starts with the largest power of 2 less than `k` minus 1, followed by the difference `k - (largest power of 2 less than k - 1)`, and then `n-2` zeros if necessary.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not always maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Let's analyze why:

The program works as follows:
1. For `n == 1`, it simply prints `k` as the only element.
2. For `n > 1`, it finds the largest power of 2 less than `k`, subtracts it from `k`, and then adds the remainder and the necessary zeros to make the sequence length `n`.

However, this approach does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR. Here is a counterexample to demonstrate this:

**Counterexample:**
Input:
```
1
3 5
```

Expected Output (one of many possible correct outputs):
```
3 1 1
```
Explanation: `3 | 1 | 1 = 3` in binary is `11`, which has 2 ones.

Actual Output from the given program:
```
3 2 0
```
Explanation: `3 | 2 | 0 = 3` in binary is `11`, which has 2 ones.

While in this specific example the output is correct, the program does not always produce the optimal sequence. For instance, consider the following input:

**Another Counterexample:**
Input:
```
1
4 10
```

Expected Output (one of many possible correct outputs):
```
7 1 1 1
```
Explanation: `7 | 1 | 1 | 1 = 7` in binary is `111`, which has 3 ones.

Actual Output from the given program:
```
7 3 0 0
```
Explanation: `7 | 3 | 0 | 0 = 7` in binary is `111`, which has 3 ones.

However, the program could produce a suboptimal sequence for other values. For example:

**Suboptimal Example:**
Input:
```
1
4 15
```

Expected Output (one of many possible correct outputs):
```
15 1 1 1
```
Explanation: `15 | 1 | 1 | 1 = 15` in binary is `1111`, which has 4 ones.

Actual Output from the given program:
```
15 7 0 0
```
Explanation: `15 | 7 | 0 | 0 = 15` in binary is `1111`, which has 4 ones.

While the above example works, consider a more complex case where the program might fail:

**Failure Example:**
Input:
```
1
5 17
```

Expected Output (one of many possible correct outputs):
```
15 1 1 1 1
```
Explanation: `15 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 = 15` in binary is `1111`, which has 4 ones.

Actual Output from the given program:
```
15 2 0 0 0
```
Explanation: `15 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 = 15` in binary is `1111`, which has 4 ones.

However, a more optimal sequence could be:
```
8 8 1 0 0
```
Explanation: `8 | 8 | 1 | 0 | 0 = 15` in binary is `1111`, which has 4 ones, but the bitwise OR could be constructed differently to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation.

Thus, the program does not always ensure that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR is maximized. Therefore, the program is not correct.
