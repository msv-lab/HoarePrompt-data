In the provided for loop, the loop head only involves the underscore `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The underscore `_` is a throwaway variable that does not need to be adjusted since it is not used within the loop. The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`, which should be a positive integer representing the number of test cases (`t`).

Given the problem statement, the number of test cases `t` is already provided as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Therefore, the loop will execute `t` times as long as `t` is a positive integer within the specified range.

Since the state of `t` is already defined before the loop starts and is within the valid range, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
