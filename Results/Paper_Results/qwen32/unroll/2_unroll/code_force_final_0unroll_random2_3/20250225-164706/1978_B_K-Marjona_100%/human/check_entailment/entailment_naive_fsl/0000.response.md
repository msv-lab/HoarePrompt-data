Let's analyze the provided program and see if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling the buns according to the promotion rules.

Here is the given program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
```

### Key Points to Consider

1. **Case 1: \( b \leq a \)**
   - If the modified price \( b \) is less than or equal to the usual price \( a \), then it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price \( a \).
   - The formula used in the program: `a * n` is correct.

2. **Case 2: \( b > a \)**
   - If the modified price \( b \) is greater than the usual price \( a \), then we need to determine the optimal number of buns \( k \) to sell at the modified price.
   - The formula used in the program: `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a` is intended to calculate the maximum profit.
   - The value of \( k \) is set to `min(n, b - a)`, which means we can sell up to \( b - a \) buns at the modified price, but not more than \( n \) buns in total.

### Checking Edge Cases

1. **Case 1: \( b \leq a \)**
   - Example: \( n = 4, a = 4, b = 5 \)
     - Since \( b > a \), the code should use the formula for \( b > a \).
     - Correct output: 17 (as per the problem description).
   - Example: \( n = 4, a = 4, b = 3 \)
     - Since \( b \leq a \), the code should use `a * n`.
     - Correct output: 16 (4 * 4).

2. **Case 2: \( b > a \)**
   - Example: \( n = 5, a = 5, b = 9 \)
     - The optimal \( k \) is `min(5, 9 - 5) = min(5, 4) = 4`.
     - Correct output: 35 (as per the problem description).
   - Example: \( n = 10, a = 10, b = 5 \)
     - Since \( b \leq a \), the code should use `a * n`.
     - Correct output: 100 (10 * 10).

3. **Edge Case: Large Values**
   - Example: \( n = 1000000000, a = 1000000000, b = 1000000000 \)
     - Since \( b = a \), the code should use `a * n`.
     - Correct output: \( 1000000000 \times 1000000000 \).

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears to handle all the cases correctly as per the problem description. The logic and formulas used are appropriate for both scenarios (\( b \leq a \) and \( b > a \)).

Correctness: **True**.

### Explanation

The program correctly handles the cases where the modified price \( b \) is less than or equal to the usual price \( a \) by selling all buns at the usual price. When \( b > a \), the program calculates the optimal number of buns \( k \) to sell at the modified price and computes the profit accordingly. The program also handles large values correctly without any issues.
