Let's carefully analyze the given program and the function summary to ensure that the program correctly computes the maximum profit for each test case as described in the problem statement.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling the buns according to the promotion rules.

Here is the given program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
```

### Key Points to Consider

1. **Case 1: \( b \leq a \)**
   - If the modified price \( b \) is less than or equal to the usual price \( a \), then it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price \( a \).
   - The formula used in the program: `a * n` is correct.

2. **Case 2: \( b > a \)**
   - If the modified price \( b \) is greater than the usual price \( a \), then we need to determine the optimal number of buns \( k \) to sell at the modified price.
   - The formula used in the program: `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a` is intended to calculate the maximum profit.
   - The value of \( k \) is set to `min(n, b - a)`, which means we can sell up to \( b - a \) buns at the modified price, but not more than \( n \) buns in total.

### Checking Edge Cases and Correctness

1. **Case 1: \( b \leq a \)**
   - Example: \( n = 4, a = 4, b = 3 \)
     - Since \( b \leq a \), the code should use `a * n`.
     - Correct output: 16 (4 * 4).
     - The code correctly prints 16.

2. **Case 2: \( b > a \)**
   - Example: \( n = 5, a = 5, b = 9 \)
     - The optimal \( k \) is `min(5, 9 - 5) = min(5, 4) = 4`.
     - The profit calculation is:
       \[
       \text{Profit} = 9 \times 4 - \frac{4 \times (4 - 1)}{2} + (5 - 4) \times 5 = 36 - 6 + 5 = 35
       \]
     - Correct output: 35 (as per the problem description).
     - The code correctly prints 35.

3. **Edge Case: Large Values**
   - Example: \( n = 1000000000, a = 1000000000, b = 1000000000 \)
     - Since \( b = a \), the code should use `a * n`.
     - Correct output: \( 1000000000 \times 1000000000 \).
     - The code correctly prints the correct large value.

### Validation of Function Summary

The function summary states:
- If \( b \leq a \), it prints `a * n`.
- If \( b > a \), it computes a more complex expression involving `b`, `a`, and `n` and prints the result.

This matches the logic in the program:
- When \( b \leq a \), the program correctly uses `a * n`.
- When \( b > a \), the program correctly uses the formula `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a` to compute the profit.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and the function summary, it appears that the program correctly handles all the cases as per the problem description. The logic and formulas used are appropriate for both scenarios (\( b \leq a \) and \( b > a \)).

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**.

The given program is correct.
