Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of operations required to increase the median of the list such that the new median is greater than the original median. If `n` is greater than 10,000, it prints a fixed result of 1 followed by 16668.**
