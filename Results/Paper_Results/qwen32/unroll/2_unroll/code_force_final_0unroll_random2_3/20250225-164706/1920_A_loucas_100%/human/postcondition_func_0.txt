The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a set of constraints. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of integers that satisfy all given constraints. Constraints are categorized into three types: type 1 specifies an upper bound, type 2 specifies a lower bound, and type 3 specifies an integer that cannot be included. The function ensures that the calculated number is non-negative, printing 0 if no integers satisfy the constraints.
