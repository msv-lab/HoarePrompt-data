### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not compute the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array as described in the problem statement. The program simply calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which does not align with the logic required to minimize the penalty.

Let's break down the key points:

1. **Problem Description:**
   - The goal is to split the array into non-empty subarrays such that the sum of penalties of these subarrays is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

2. **Program Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of '+' and '-' characters.
   - It then returns the absolute difference between these counts.
   - This approach does not consider the optimal splitting of the array to minimize the penalty.

3. **Test Cases:**
   - **Test Case 1:**
     ```
     1
     4
     ++--
     ```
     - Expected Output: 0
     - Program Output: 0 (Correct)
     - Explanation: The string `++--` can be split into `([1, 1], [-1, -1])` or `([1], [1], [-1], [-1])` both of which result in a penalty of 0.
   - **Test Case 2:**
     ```
     1
     5
     +----+
     ```
     - Expected Output: 4
     - Program Output: 1 (Incorrect)
     - Explanation: The optimal split is not considered by the program. The program counts 2 '+' and 3 '-', and returns `abs(2 - 3) = 1`, which is incorrect.
   - **Test Case 3:**
     ```
     1
     6
     +-+-+-
     ```
     - Expected Output: 0
     - Program Output: 0 (Correct)
     - Explanation: The string `+-+-+-` can be split into `([1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1])` resulting in a penalty of `0`.

From the above analysis, it is clear that the program does not always produce the correct minimum penalty. Specifically, it does not implement the logic to find the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
