### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program based on the given function summary and the problem description.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to split a string `s` into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty for each subarray is calculated as the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by the length of the subarray.

#### Key Points:
1. **String to Array Conversion**: Each `+` in the string contributes `1` to the array, and each `-` contributes `-1`.
2. **Penalty Calculation**: For a subarray `c` of length `m`, the penalty is `|sum(c)| * m`.
3. **Optimal Splitting**: The goal is to find a way to split the array into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program does the following:
1. It counts the number of `+` in the string.
2. It calculates the number of `-` by subtracting the count of `+` from the total length of the string.
3. It returns the absolute difference between the count of `+` and `-`.

#### Issues in the Provided Program:
- The program does not consider splitting the string into subarrays to minimize the penalty.
- It simply calculates the difference between the counts of `+` and `-` and returns the absolute value of this difference, which does not solve the problem as described.

#### Function Summary:
The function `func_1` calculates and returns the absolute difference between the number of `'-'` characters and the number of `'+'` characters in the given expression string.

#### Validation Against Function Summary:
The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`. The function counts the number of `'+'` and `'-'` and returns the absolute difference, which is correct based on the function's implementation.

#### Correctness:
Given the function summary, the function `func_1` correctly computes the absolute difference between the counts of `'+'` and `'-'`. However, this does not address the core problem of minimizing the penalty by optimally splitting the string into subarrays.

#### Conclusion:
While the function `func_1` correctly implements the described behavior, it does not solve the problem of minimizing the penalty as required by the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is correct in stating that the provided program does not solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` only computes the absolute difference between the counts of `'+'` and `'-'`, which is not the optimal solution for minimizing the penalty.
