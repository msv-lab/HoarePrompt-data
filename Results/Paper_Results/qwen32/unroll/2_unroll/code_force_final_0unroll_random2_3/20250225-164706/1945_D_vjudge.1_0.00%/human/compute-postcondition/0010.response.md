Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lista_A` is a list of integers of length `n` representing the cost `a_i` for each person in the queue, but in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of integers of length `n` representing the cost `b_i` for each person in the queue, but now in the reversed order, `soma_b` is the sum of `lista_B[i]` for all `i` where `lista_A[i] >= lista_B[i]` and no `lista_A[j] < lista_B[j]` has occurred after `i` that would reset `soma_b`, `pref` is the accumulated sum as described in the loop logic, `resultado` is `float('inf')`.**

In simple terms, the variable `resultado` has been set to infinity (`float('inf')`), while all other variables retain their initial values.
