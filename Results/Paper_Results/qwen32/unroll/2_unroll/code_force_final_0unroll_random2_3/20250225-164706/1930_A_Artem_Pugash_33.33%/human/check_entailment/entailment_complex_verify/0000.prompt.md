You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        numbers = input().split()
        numbers.sort(reverse=False)
        suma = 0
        while numbers != []:
            a = int(numbers.pop(0))
            b = int(numbers.pop(0))
            suma += min(a, b)
        print(suma)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and there are 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        
        numbers = input().split()
        
        numbers.sort(reverse=False)
        
        suma = 0
        
        while numbers != []:
            a = int(numbers.pop(0))
            b = int(numbers.pop(0))
            suma += min(a, b)
        
        print(suma)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `numCases` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the minimum pairs from the list by sorting the numbers and pairing them sequentially, then prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum final score by optimally performing the n moves as described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Sorting the Numbers**: The program sorts the list of numbers in non-decreasing order. This is a key step because, to maximize the score, we always want to pair the smallest available numbers together. By sorting, the smallest numbers are at the beginning of the list, making it easy to pick the smallest available numbers in each iteration.

2. **Pairing Numbers**: The program uses a `while` loop to repeatedly pick the two smallest numbers from the sorted list. It does this by popping the first two elements from the list (which are the smallest due to the sorting step) and adds the minimum of these two numbers to the score.

3. **Updating the Score**: The score is updated by adding the minimum of the two numbers picked in each iteration. This ensures that we are always adding the smallest number available, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the score.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by wrapping the logic in a loop that runs `numCases` times. For each test case, it reads the number of integers and the list of integers, sorts the list, and calculates the score as described.

5. **Edge Cases**: The code handles edge cases such as:
   - When there is only one pair of numbers (n=1).
   - When all numbers are the same.
   - When the numbers are already sorted or unsorted.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum final score for each test case, and it follows the problem description accurately for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
