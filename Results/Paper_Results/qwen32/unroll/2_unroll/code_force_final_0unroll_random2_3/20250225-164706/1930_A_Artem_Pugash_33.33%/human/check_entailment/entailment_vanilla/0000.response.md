Reasoning:
1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n`, the number of pairs of integers on the whiteboard.
3. It then reads the 2n integers and sorts them in ascending order.
4. It initializes a `suma` variable to 0, which will store the total score.
5. The program then enters a while loop that continues until the list of numbers is empty.
6. Inside the loop, it pops the first two numbers from the list (which are the smallest two numbers due to the sorting), computes the minimum of these two numbers, and adds it to `suma`.
7. After processing all pairs, it prints the final score `suma`.

The logic of the program is correct based on the problem description:
- Sorting the numbers in ascending order ensures that when we pick pairs, we are always picking the smallest possible numbers available, which maximizes the score as we are adding the minimum of each pair to the score.
- By always picking the smallest available numbers, the program ensures that the score is maximized.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the strategy to achieve the maximum final score as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
