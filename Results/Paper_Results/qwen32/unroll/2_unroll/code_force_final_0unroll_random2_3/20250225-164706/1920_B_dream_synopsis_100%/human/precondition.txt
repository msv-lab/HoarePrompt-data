t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, k, x) and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. For each tuple, 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= n, 1 <= x <= n, and 1 <= a_i <= 1000. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
