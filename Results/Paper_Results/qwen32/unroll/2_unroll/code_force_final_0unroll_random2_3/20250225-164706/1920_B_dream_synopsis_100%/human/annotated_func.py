#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, k, and x are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n. The array a contains n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #State: The sequence of maximum values of `ans` for each test case, printed one per line.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum possible value of a specific sum after performing a series of operations involving the array elements.
