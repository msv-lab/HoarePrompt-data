Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The program seems to be attempting to track the number of increasing subsequences by maintaining two variables `a` and `b`, but the logic is flawed and does not account for all possible ways to split the array optimally.

To solve the problem optimally, the key observation is that the minimum penalty is achieved by splitting the array such that one of the subsequences is as non-decreasing as possible. The other subsequence will then have fewer or no increasing pairs. The minimum penalty is essentially the number of increasing pairs in the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the array.

A correct approach would involve finding the longest non-decreasing subsequence and then the penalty would be the total number of increasing pairs in the array minus the number of increasing pairs in this subsequence. However, the provided program does not implement this logic correctly.

Here is a sketch of a correct approach:

1. Traverse the array to count the total number of increasing pairs.
2. Use dynamic programming to find the longest non-decreasing subsequence.
3. Count the number of increasing pairs in this subsequence.
4. Subtract the number of increasing pairs in the longest non-decreasing subsequence from the total number of increasing pairs to get the minimum penalty.

A correct implementation would look something like this:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Count total number of increasing pairs
        total_increasing_pairs = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            if l[i] > l[i - 1]:
                total_increasing_pairs += 1
        
        # Find the longest non-decreasing subsequence
        dp = [1] * n
        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(i):
                if l[i] >= l[j]:
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
        # Count the number of increasing pairs in the longest non-decreasing subsequence
        # This can be done by reconstructing the subsequence and counting pairs
        # Here we use a simpler approach by using the dp array directly
        max_length = max(dp)
        used = [False] * n
        current_length = 0
        last_value = -1
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if dp[i] == max_length - current_length and (last_value == -1 or l[i] <= last_value):
                last_value = l[i]
                current_length += 1
                used[i] = True
        
        increasing_in_lis = 0
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if used[i] and used[i + 1] and l[i] < l[i + 1]:
                increasing_in_lis += 1
        
        # Minimum penalty is total increasing pairs minus increasing pairs in LIS
        min_penalty = total_increasing_pairs - increasing_in_lis
        print(min_penalty)

func()
```

This approach ensures that we correctly compute the minimum penalty by leveraging the longest non-decreasing subsequence.
