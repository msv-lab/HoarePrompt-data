### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to calculate the minimum penalty for splitting the array into two subsequences by iterating through the array and maintaining two variables (`a` and `b`) to track the elements that contribute to the penalty. However, the logic used to calculate the penalty does not align with the problem's requirements.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Initialization of `a` and `b`**: The variable `a` is initialized to the first element of the list, and `b` is initialized to the first element that is greater than `a`. However, the subsequent logic does not correctly manage these variables to ensure that they always represent the optimal splits.

2. **Logic for updating `a` and `b`**: The program updates `a` and `b` based on the comparison of the current element with `a` and `b`. However, the logic does not correctly handle the case where the current element can be part of either subsequence without increasing the penalty. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the elements are being added to the subsequences in a way that minimizes the penalty.

3. **Counting the penalty**: The variable `c` is incremented only when a new element is added to one of the subsequences in a way that increases the penalty. However, the program does not correctly handle the case where the current element can be part of either subsequence without increasing the penalty.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty for splitting the array. The optimal approach to solve this problem would involve a different strategy, such as using dynamic programming or a greedy approach to ensure that the elements are being added to the subsequences in a way that minimizes the penalty.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **False**
