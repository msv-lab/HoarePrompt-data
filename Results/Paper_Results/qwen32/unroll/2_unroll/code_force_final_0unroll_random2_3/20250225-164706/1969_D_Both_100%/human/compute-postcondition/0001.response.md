The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `test_cases`. The loop will execute if `test_cases` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `test_cases` to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n, `prices` is a list of n integers, `neg_prices` is a list of n integers, `bonuses` is a list of n integers, `max_profit` is an integer initialized to 0, `current_profit` is an integer initialized to 0, `combined` is a list of tuples sorted based on the bonus values, `test_cases` must be greater than 0**
