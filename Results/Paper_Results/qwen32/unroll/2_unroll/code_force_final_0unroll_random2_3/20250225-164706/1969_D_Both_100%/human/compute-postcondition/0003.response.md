Functionality: **The function `func_4` accepts no parameters directly but utilizes several predefined variables including `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, and `combined`. It processes these variables to determine and return the maximum possible profit (`max_profit`) that can be achieved under the given constraints. The function handles the logic of selecting items based on their bonuses and prices to optimize the profit for both Alice and Bob.**
