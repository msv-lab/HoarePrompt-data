To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, let's break down the provided code and understand how the variables evolve during each iteration.

### Code Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - `r` is an empty list that will store the results of each test case.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each test case (`t` times):
     - `n` is the number of constraints.
     - `cx` is a set that will store all `x` values for constraints of type 3.
     - `ax` is initialized to a very large number (`1000000000 + 7`), representing the maximum possible value for constraints of type 2.
     - `bx` is initialized to a very small number (`-1`), representing the minimum possible value for constraints of type 1.
     - For each constraint:
       - If the constraint type `a` is 1, update `bx` to be the maximum of its current value and `x`.
       - If the constraint type `a` is 2, update `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and `x`.
       - If the constraint type `a` is 3, add `x` to the set `cx`.
     - After processing all constraints:
       - If `bx` (the minimum required value) is greater than or equal to `ax` (the maximum allowed value), it means there is no valid `k` that satisfies all constraints, so append `0` to `r`.
       - Otherwise, calculate the number of valid `k` values in the range `[bx, ax]` that are not in `cx` and append this number to `r`.

### Output State:
After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the output state will be the list `r` containing the results of each test case.

### Example:
Let's assume `t = 1` and the constraints are:
- `n = 3`
- Constraints: `1 5`, `2 10`, `3 7`

**Execution**:
- `bx` will be updated to `5` (from constraint `1 5`).
- `ax` will be updated to `10` (from constraint `2 10`).
- `cx` will contain `{7}` (from constraint `3 7`).
- Since `bx` (5) is less than `ax` (10), we calculate the valid `k` values in the range `[5, 10]` that are not in `cx`.
- Valid `k` values are `5, 6, 8, 9, 10` (excluding `7`).
- The number of valid `k` values is `5`.

**Output State**:
- `r` will be `[5]`.

### General Output State:
Given the loop processes `t` test cases, the final state of `r` will be a list of integers, each representing the number of valid `k` values for each test case.

Output State: **[result1, result2, ..., result_t]**, where `result_i` is the number of valid `k` values for the `i-th` test case.
