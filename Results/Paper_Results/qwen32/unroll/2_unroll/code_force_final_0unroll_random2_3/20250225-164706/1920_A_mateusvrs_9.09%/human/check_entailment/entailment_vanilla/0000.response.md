Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
1. We have `t` test cases.
2. Each test case has `n` constraints.
3. There are three types of constraints:
   - Type 1: `k >= x`
   - Type 2: `k <= x`
   - Type 3: `k != x`
4. We need to find the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints for each test case.
5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, and the answer is finite.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `t = int(input())`: Read the number of test cases.
   - `r = []`: Initialize a list to store results for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - `n = int(input())`: Read the number of constraints for the current test case.
   - `cx = set()`: Initialize a set to store the values of `x` for constraints of type 3.
   - `ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)`: Initialize `ax` to a very large number. This will store the smallest `x` from constraints of type 2.
   - `bx = -1`: Initialize `bx` to a very small number. This will store the largest `x` from constraints of type 1.

3. **Reading Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, read `a` (type of constraint) and `x` (value).
   - If `a == 1`, update `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and `bx`.
   - If `a == 2`, update `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
   - If `a == 3`, add `x` to the set `cx`.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - If `bx >= ax`, it means there is no possible `k` that satisfies both `k >= bx` and `k <= ax`. Hence, append `0` to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, calculate the number of valid `k` values:
     - `tmp = 0`: Initialize a counter for values in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
     - Iterate over each value `i` in `cx`:
       - If `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`, increment `tmp`.
     - The number of valid `k` values is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` (total possible `k` values minus those that are excluded by type 3 constraints).
     - Append this value to the result list `r`.

5. **Output:**
   - Print all results in `r`, separated by newlines.

### Correctness Verification:
- The program correctly identifies the smallest `k` (`bx`) that must be satisfied by constraints of type 1 and the largest `k` (`ax`) that must be satisfied by constraints of type 2.
- It correctly handles constraints of type 3 by excluding values in the range `[bx, ax]` that are in the set `cx`.
- The logic for determining the number of valid `k` values (`ax - bx + 1 - tmp`) is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
