The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of constraints. For each test case, it determines the number of integers `k` that satisfy all the given constraints and prints the result for each test case. The constraints specify that `k` must be greater than or equal to some values, less than or equal to some values, and not equal to some values. If no such `k` exists, the result is 0.
