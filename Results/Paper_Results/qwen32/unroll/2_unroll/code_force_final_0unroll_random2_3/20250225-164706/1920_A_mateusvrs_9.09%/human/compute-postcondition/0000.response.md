The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer `t` represents the number of constraints in the problem.

Since `t` is the only variable being modified, and it is directly assigned the value from the input, the initial state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints, followed by `n` lines where each line contains two integers `a` and `x` (a ∈ {1, 2, 3}, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). The integer `a` denotes the type of constraint: if `a=1`, `k` must be greater than or equal to `x`; if `a=2`, `k` must be less than or equal to `x`; if `a=3`, `k` must be not equal to `x`. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same. `t` is an input integer.**
