### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program logic and the function summary to ensure everything aligns with the problem description.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `t = int(input())`: Reads the number of test cases.
   - `r = []`: Initializes a list to store results for each test case.
   - For each test case, `n = int(input())` reads the number of constraints.
   - `cx = set()`: Initializes a set to store values for constraints of type 3.
   - `ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)`: Initializes `ax` to a large number (1,000,000,007), which will store the smallest `x` from constraints of type 2.
   - `bx = -1`: Initializes `bx` to a small number (-1), which will store the largest `x` from constraints of type 1.

2. **Reading Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, read `a` (type of constraint) and `x` (value).
   - If `a == 1`, update `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and `bx`.
   - If `a == 2`, update `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
   - If `a == 3`, add `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - If `bx >= ax`, it means there is no possible `k` that satisfies both `k >= bx` and `k <= ax`. Hence, append `0` to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, calculate the number of valid `k` values:
     - `tmp = 0`: Initializes a counter for values in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
     - Iterate over each value `i` in `cx`:
       - If `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`, increment `tmp`.
     - The number of valid `k` values is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` (total possible `k` values minus those that are excluded by type 3 constraints).
     - Append this value to the result list `r`.

4. **Output:**
   - Print all results in `r`, separated by newlines.

### Verification:
- **Initialization and Constraint Handling:** The program correctly identifies the smallest `k` (`bx`) and the largest `k` (`ax`) based on constraints of type 1 and 2, respectively. It also correctly handles constraints of type 3 by storing values in a set `cx`.
- **Feasibility Check:** The check `if bx >= ax` correctly identifies when no valid `k` exists.
- **Counting Valid `k` Values:** The calculation `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` correctly computes the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the count of excluded values (`tmp`) from the total possible values in the range `[bx, ax]`.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's consider the first test case from the example input:

```
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```

- `bx` will be updated to `3` (from `1 3`).
- `ax` will be updated to `10` (from `2 10`).
- `cx` will contain `{1, 5}`.
- Since `bx (3) < ax (10)`, we proceed to count valid `k` values.
- `tmp` will be `2` because both `1` and `5` are within the range `[3, 10]`.
- The number of valid `k` values is `10 - 3 + 1 - 2 = 7`.

The program correctly computes the result as `7`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
