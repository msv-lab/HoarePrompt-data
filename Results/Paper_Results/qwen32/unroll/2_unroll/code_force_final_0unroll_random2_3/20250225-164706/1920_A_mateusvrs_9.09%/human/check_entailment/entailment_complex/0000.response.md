### Reasoning:

The provided Python program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it initializes variables:
     - `cx` as a set to store values that `k` must not be equal to.
     - `ax` as a large number (1000000007) to store the minimum upper bound for `k`.
     - `bx` as -1 to store the maximum lower bound for `k`.

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint in the test case:
     - If the constraint type `a` is 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x), it updates `bx` to the maximum of its current value and `x`.
     - If the constraint type `a` is 2 (k must be less than or equal to x), it updates `ax` to the minimum of its current value and `x`.
     - If the constraint type `a` is 3 (k must not be equal to x), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Calculating the Result**:
   - After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx` (the maximum lower bound) is greater than or equal to `ax` (the minimum upper bound). If so, it means there are no valid values for `k` that satisfy all constraints, and the result is 0.
   - If `bx` is less than `ax`, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the number of integers in `cx` that lie within the range `[bx, ax]` from the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` (which is `ax - bx + 1`).

4. **Output**:
   - The program appends the result for each test case to the list `r`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints for each test case. It also correctly handles the edge cases where no valid `k` exists.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **True**
