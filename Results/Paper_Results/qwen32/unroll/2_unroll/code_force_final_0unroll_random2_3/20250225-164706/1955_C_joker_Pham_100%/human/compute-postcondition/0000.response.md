Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`.**

In this output state, the variables `l` and `r` have been assigned the values 0 and `n - 1`, respectively. All other variables (`n`, `k`, and `a`) retain their initial values and constraints.
