### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game involving coins arranged in a circle. The key to solving this problem lies in the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins ("U").

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the provided functions and their roles:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads multiple test cases from the standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the coins.
   - It returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the integer `n` and the string `s` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes a tuple `case` as input, which contains the number of coins `n` and the string `s`.
   - It counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s`.
   - If the count of 'U' is odd, it returns 'YES', indicating Alice will win. Otherwise, it returns 'NO', indicating Bob will win.

### Analysis:
- According to the problem, the game's outcome can be determined by the parity of the number of facing-up coins. If the number of 'U' coins is odd, Alice will win. If it's even, Bob will win.
- The provided `func_2` correctly implements this logic by checking if the number of 'U' characters is odd or even and returning 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.
- The `func_1` function correctly reads and parses the input as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as both functions together meet the problem description. The input is read correctly, and the game's outcome is determined based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.

**Correctness: True**
