The code snippet calculates the number of 'U' characters in the string contained in the second element of the `case` tuple. This value is then assigned to the variable `ups`.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `case` is a tuple where the first element is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second element is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D".
- `ups` is not defined in the initial state.

After the code execution:
- `ups` will hold the count of 'U' characters in the string.

Output State: **`case` is a tuple where the first element is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second element is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D"; `ups` is the count of 'U' characters in the string `case[1]`.**
