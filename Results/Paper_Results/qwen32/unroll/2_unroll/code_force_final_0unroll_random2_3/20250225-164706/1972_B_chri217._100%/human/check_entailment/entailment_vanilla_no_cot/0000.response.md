To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in the functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly solves the problem described.

### Analysis:

1. **Input Reading (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the coins.
   - It stores each test case as a tuple `(n, s)` in the list `cases`.
   - The function correctly reads and processes the input according to the problem statement.

2. **Game Logic (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` takes a single test case `(n, s)` as input.
   - It calculates the number of "U" (facing-up) coins in the string `s`.
   - It returns "YES" if the number of "U" coins is odd, and "NO" if it is even.
   - The key point here is understanding the game mechanics and the winning condition.

### Game Mechanics and Winning Condition:
- The game involves players removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins.
- The game ends when there are no facing-up coins left, and the player who cannot make a move loses.
- The crucial insight is that the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins determines the winner:
  - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will win.
  - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will win.
- This is because each move reduces the number of facing-up coins by one, and the player who faces an odd number of remaining moves (starting with an odd number of "U" coins) will be the last to make a move and win.

### Conclusion:
The logic implemented in `func_2` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. Therefore, the program is correct.
