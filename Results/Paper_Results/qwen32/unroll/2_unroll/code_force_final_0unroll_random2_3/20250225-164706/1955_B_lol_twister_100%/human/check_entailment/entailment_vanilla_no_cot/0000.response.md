Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
- The task is to determine if a given list of integers can form a specific progressive square matrix.
- The matrix is constructed using the rules:
  - The top-left element is `a11`.
  - The element at position `(i, j)` is `a11 + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d`.
- The program should check if the given list of integers can be rearranged to form such a matrix.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, `n`, `c`, and `d` are read.
   - The list `l` of `n*n` integers is read.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It finds the minimum value in the list `l` and assumes it to be `a11`.
   - It constructs a list `li` of `n*n` elements based on the formula `a11 + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d`.
   - It sorts both `l` and `li`.
   - It checks if the sorted `l` is equal to the sorted `li`.

### Correctness Check:
- The program assumes that the minimum value in the list is `a11`, which is a reasonable assumption given the construction rules.
- The program correctly constructs the progressive square using the formula and checks if the sorted list of given integers matches the sorted list of the constructed square.
- If the sorted lists match, it returns "YES", otherwise "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to check if the given list of integers can form the progressive square as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:
**Correctness: True**
