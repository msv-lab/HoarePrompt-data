### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, the program code, and the annotated version of the code.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires constructing a progressive square of size \( n \times n \) using the formula \( a_{1,1} + k \cdot c + d \cdot h \) for \( k, h \in [0, n-1] \).
   - The task is to check if a given list of \( n^2 \) integers can be rearranged to form this progressive square.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \), and the list \( b \).
   - The function `func_1` is called to determine if the elements in \( b \) can form a progressive square.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Finding `a_{1,1}`**: The program sets `a` to the minimum value in the list `l`. This is a reasonable assumption since `a_{1,1}` is the smallest element in the progressive square.
   - **Generating the Progressive Square**: The program generates the elements of the progressive square using the formula \( a + k \cdot c + d \cdot h \) for \( k \) and \( h \) ranging from 0 to \( n-1 \).
   - **Sorting and Comparison**: The program sorts both the generated list `li` and the input list `l` and then compares them. If they are equal, it means the input list can form the progressive square, and it returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

4. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - It confirms that `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`.
   - It confirms that `li` is a list of \( n^2 \) integers generated using the formula \( a + k \cdot c + d \cdot h \).
   - It confirms that both `li` and `l` are sorted before comparison.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - **Correctness of `a_{1,1}`**: The assumption that `a_{1,1}` is the minimum value in the list is correct.
   - **Correctness of the Formula**: The formula \( a + k \cdot c + d \cdot h \) is correctly used to generate the elements of the progressive square.
   - **Sorting and Comparison**: Sorting both lists and comparing them is a valid approach to check if the input list can form the progressive square.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Duplicates**: The program does not handle duplicates explicitly, but since the progressive square elements are generated uniquely based on the formula, duplicates in the input list should not be a problem as long as the formula generates the same unique elements.
   - **Range of Values**: The values of `c` and `d` can be up to \(10^6\), and `n` can be up to 500. The generated values can be large but within the range of typical integer operations in Python.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases. The program correctly identifies the smallest element as `a_{1,1}`, generates the progressive square elements using the given formula, and checks if the input list can form the progressive square by comparing sorted lists.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**.
