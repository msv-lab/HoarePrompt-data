### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided program code, and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Understanding:
The problem requires constructing a progressive square of size \( n \times n \) based on the formula \( a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)c + (j-1)d \), where \( a_{1,1} \) is the minimum value in the array \( l \). The task is to verify if the given array \( l \) can be rearranged to match the elements of this progressive square.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \).
   - It reads the array \( l \) containing \( n^2 \) integers.

2. **Progressive Square Generation**:
   - The program determines \( a_{1,1} \) as the minimum value in the array \( l \).
   - It constructs the progressive square by iterating over each cell \( (i, j) \) and calculating the value using the formula \( a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)c + (j-1)d \).
   - These values are stored in the list \( li \).

3. **Verification**:
   - Both the generated list \( li \) and the input list \( l \) are sorted.
   - The program checks if the sorted versions of \( li \) and \( l \) are equal. If they are, it returns "YES"; otherwise, it returns "NO".

#### Function Summary:
The function `func_1` checks if the input list `l` can be rearranged to match the progressive square generated by the formula \( a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)c + (j-1)d \), where \( a_{1,1} \) is the minimum value in `l`. It returns 'yes' if such a rearrangement is possible, otherwise 'no'.

#### Evaluation:
- The program correctly identifies \( a_{1,1} \) as the minimum value in the array.
- It accurately constructs the progressive square using the provided formula.
- It correctly compares the sorted versions of the generated list and the input list to verify if the array can form the progressive square.

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct as it properly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

**Final: True**
