Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly implements the problem description.

### Analysis of the Program

The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the size of the square `n`, and the integers `c` and `d`. Then it reads the list of integers `b` which are the elements found by Maxim. The function `func_1` is supposed to determine if the elements in `b` can form a progressive square with the given `n`, `c`, and `d`.

Here is the function `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):
        for h in range(0, n):
            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if l == li:
        return 'yes'
    return 'no'
```

### Steps in the Function:
1. **Finding `a_{1,1}`**: The program sets `a` to the minimum value in the list `l`. This is a reasonable assumption since `a_{1,1}` is the smallest element in the progressive square.
2. **Generating the Progressive Square**: The program generates the elements of the progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for `k` and `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.
3. **Sorting and Comparison**: The program sorts both the generated list `li` and the input list `l` and then compares them. If they are equal, it means the input list can form the progressive square, and it returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

### Potential Issues:
The main logic seems correct based on the problem description. However, there are a few points to consider:
- **Correctness of `a_{1,1}`**: The assumption that `a_{1,1}` is the minimum value in the list is correct because `a_{1,1}` is the smallest element in the progressive square.
- **Correctness of the Formula**: The formula `a + k * c + d * h` is correctly used to generate the elements of the progressive square.
- **Sorting and Comparison**: Sorting both lists and comparing them is a valid approach to check if the input list can form the progressive square.

### Edge Cases:
- **Duplicates**: The program does not handle duplicates explicitly, but since the progressive square elements are generated uniquely based on the formula, duplicates in the input list should not be a problem as long as the formula generates the same unique elements.
- **Range of Values**: The values of `c` and `d` can be up to \(10^6\), and `n` can be up to 500. The generated values can be up to \(a + (n-1) * c + (n-1) * d\), which can be large but within the range of typical integer operations in Python.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program, it appears that it correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases. The program correctly identifies the smallest element as `a_{1,1}`, generates the progressive square elements using the given formula, and checks if the input list can form the progressive square by comparing sorted lists.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**.
