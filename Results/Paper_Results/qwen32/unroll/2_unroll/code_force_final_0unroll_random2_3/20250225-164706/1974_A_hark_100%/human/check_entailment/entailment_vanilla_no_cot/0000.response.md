Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the calculation of the number of screens required, especially when both x (1x1 icons) and y (2x2 icons) are greater than zero. Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Initial Calculation of `bxsfory`**: 
   ```python
   bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
   ```
   This part is correct as it calculates the minimum number of screens needed to accommodate the 2x2 icons. Since each screen can fit a maximum of two 2x2 icons (as they occupy 4 cells each and a screen has 15 cells), `math.ceil(y / 2)` gives the correct number of screens.

2. **Adjusting `x`**:
   ```python
   x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
   ```
   This line is incorrect. The intention seems to be to adjust the number of 1x1 icons (`x`) after placing the 2x2 icons, but the calculation is flawed. The term `bxsfory * 15` is incorrect because it subtracts 15 cells for each screen used by 2x2 icons, which does not make sense. Instead, we should subtract the actual number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons, which is `y * 4`.

3. **Calculating `bxsfory1`**:
   ```python
   bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
   ```
   This part is correct in terms of logic, assuming `x` has been correctly adjusted. However, due to the incorrect adjustment of `x` in the previous step, this calculation will be incorrect.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = math.ceil(y / 2)
        # Subtract the cells occupied by 2x2 icons from x
        x -= y * 4
        # Calculate the screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons
        if x > 0:
            screens_for_1x1 = math.ceil(x / 15)
        else:
            screens_for_1x1 = 0
        # Total screens needed
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + screens_for_1x1
        print(total_screens)

func_1()
```

This corrected program properly calculates the number of screens needed by first accounting for the 2x2 icons and then adjusting the number of 1x1 icons accordingly.
