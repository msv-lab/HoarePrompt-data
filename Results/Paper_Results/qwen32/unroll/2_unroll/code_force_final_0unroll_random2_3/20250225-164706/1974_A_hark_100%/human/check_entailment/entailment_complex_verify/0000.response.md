### Reasoning:

1. **Syntax Error:**
   - The function `func_1()` is called before it is defined, which will indeed result in a `NameError` during execution. This is a critical issue that needs to be fixed for the code to run without errors.

2. **Logical Error:**
   - The main logical error in the code is the calculation of the remaining `1x1` icons after placing `2x2` icons. The code incorrectly subtracts `bxsfory * 15` from `x` instead of `bxsfory * 4`. This leads to incorrect results in several test cases.

3. **Detailed Analysis of the Code:**
   - **Case 1: Both `x > 0` and `y > 0`:**
     - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`: This correctly calculates the number of screens needed for `2x2` icons, assuming each screen can fit up to 2 `2x2` icons.
     - `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`: This line is incorrect. The subtraction should be `bxsfory * 4` instead of `bxsfory * 15`. The `15` is likely a mistake, as each `2x2` icon occupies 4 cells, not 15.
     - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)`: This line calculates the number of screens needed for the remaining `1x1` icons. However, since `x` is incorrectly adjusted, this calculation is also incorrect.
     - `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)`: This prints the total number of screens needed, which is incorrect due to the previous errors.

   - **Case 2: `x == 0` and `y > 0`:**
     - `print(math.ceil(y / 2))`: This correctly calculates the number of screens needed for `2x2` icons when there are no `1x1` icons.

   - **Case 3: `x > 0` and `y == 0`:**
     - `print(math.ceil(x / 15))`: This is incorrect. Each screen can fit up to 15 `1x1` icons, but the code incorrectly uses `15` as the divisor. It should be `15` if each screen is fully utilized, but the logic should consider the exact placement of icons more carefully.

   - **Case 4: `x == 0` and `y == 0`:**
     - `print(0)`: This is correct as no screens are needed if there are no icons.

4. **Example Test Case:**
   - **Input:** `x = 13, y = 2`
   - **Expected Output:** `2`
   - **Actual Output:** `3`
   - **Explanation:** The code incorrectly calculates the remaining `1x1` icons as `13 - 2*15 = -17`, leading to an incorrect result.

### Conclusion:

The provided code contains both syntax and logical errors. The syntax error prevents the code from running, and the logical error leads to incorrect calculations of the minimum number of screens required.

### Final: **False**
