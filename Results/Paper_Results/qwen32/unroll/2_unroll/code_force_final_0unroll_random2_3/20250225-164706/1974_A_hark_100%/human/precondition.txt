The function `sol()` does not take any input parameters. The input is provided through standard input, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers x and y (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99), where x is the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon and y is the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon.
