The provided code snippet only initializes a constant `MOD` with the value `1000000007`. No other variables are defined or modified in this snippet. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of the `MOD` variable.

Output State: **The input consists of several test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the array and the number of operations, respectively. This is followed by a line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the array itself. The sum of n and k across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `MOD` is 1000000007.**
