Let's analyze the provided Python program and determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of an array after performing `k` operations. Each operation allows us to select any contiguous subarray, compute its sum, and insert this sum anywhere in the array. The final sum should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Key Points:
1. **Maximize the Sum**: To maximize the sum, we need to consider how to use the operations effectively. Inserting the sum of the entire array or a positive subarray can be beneficial.
2. **Handling Negative Numbers**: If the sum of the entire array is negative, inserting zeros (from empty subarrays) would be optimal.
3. **Efficient Calculation**: The operations can be performed efficiently by leveraging the properties of the maximum subarray sum (Kadane's algorithm).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, reads the length of the array `n`, the number of operations `k`, and the array elements.
2. **Calculating the Total Sum**: The program calculates the total sum `s` of the array.
3. **Finding Maximum Subarray Sum**: Using Kadane's algorithm, the program finds the maximum subarray sum `t`.
4. **Initial Answer Calculation**: The initial answer is calculated as \((s + t) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
5. **Handling Multiple Operations**: For each of the remaining \(k-1\) operations, the program doubles the maximum subarray sum `t` and adds it to the answer, taking modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at each step.

### Correctness:
The logic of the program is correct:
- **Maximizing Sum**: By using the maximum subarray sum `t`, we ensure that the operations contribute positively to the sum.
- **Handling Negative Sums**: If `s` is negative, adding zeros (from empty subarrays) is handled implicitly by the condition `if tmp < 0: tmp = 0`.
- **Efficiency**: The program efficiently handles up to \(2 \times 10^5\) elements and operations due to the use of modulo operations and efficient subarray sum calculation.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
