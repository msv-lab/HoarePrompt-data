To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic it uses to solve the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to maximize the sum of an array after performing `k` operations. In each operation, we can select any contiguous subarray of the array, compute its sum, and insert this sum anywhere in the array.

### Key Observations:
1. **Empty Subarray:** Inserting the sum of an empty subarray (which is `0`) does not change the sum of the array.
2. **Positive Subarrays:** Inserting the sum of a positive subarray increases the sum of the array.
3. **Max Subarray Sum:** The optimal strategy involves inserting the maximum possible subarray sum (`t`) multiple times. This is because each insertion of `t` can potentially double the contribution of the previous insertions, leading to an exponential increase in the sum.

### Program Logic:
1. **Reading Input:** The program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the number of operations `k`, followed by the array `a`.
2. **Initial Sum Calculation:** It calculates the sum `s` of the array.
3. **Max Subarray Sum Calculation:** It calculates the maximum subarray sum `t` using a variation of Kadane's algorithm.
4. **Answer Calculation:**
   - The initial answer is the sum of the array plus the maximum subarray sum (`(s + t) % MOD`).
   - For each of the remaining `k-1` operations, it doubles the maximum subarray sum `t` and adds it to the answer, taking care to take the result modulo `10^9 + 7` at each step.

### Correctness Verification:
- The program correctly calculates the initial sum of the array.
- It correctly finds the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm.
- It correctly handles the doubling of the maximum subarray sum for each of the `k-1` operations.
- The program takes care of the modulo operation correctly to ensure the result fits within the required constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem. It efficiently calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations and outputs the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Correctness: **True**
