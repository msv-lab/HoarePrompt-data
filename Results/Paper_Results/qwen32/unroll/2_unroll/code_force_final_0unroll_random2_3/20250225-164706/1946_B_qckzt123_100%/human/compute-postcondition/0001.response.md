The provided code reads an integer `T` from the standard input, which represents the number of test cases. The values of `n`, `k`, and the array `a` are not yet read, and they remain part of the precondition for subsequent test cases. The variable `MOD` is given as 1000000007 and remains unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `MOD` is 1000000007.**
