### Reasoning:
The given program aims to solve the problem by calculating the maximum possible sum of the array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves inserting the sum of any contiguous subarray into the array. Here's a breakdown of the program and its logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of operations `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a` of `n` integers.

2. **Calculating Initial Sum:**
   - It calculates the sum of all elements in the array `s`.

3. **Finding Maximum Subarray Sum:**
   - It uses Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray `t`. This is done by iterating through the array and maintaining a running sum `tmp`, resetting `tmp` to 0 whenever it becomes negative, and keeping track of the maximum sum encountered (`t`).

4. **Calculating Result:**
   - The initial result `ans` is calculated as `(s + t) % MOD`.
   - For each of the remaining `k-1` operations, the program doubles the maximum subarray sum `t`, takes it modulo `MOD`, and adds it to `ans`, again taking `ans` modulo `MOD`.

5. **Output:**
   - The final result `ans` is printed for each test case.

### Key Points:
- The program correctly uses Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum, which is crucial for maximizing the sum after each operation.
- The logic for handling the operations (doubling the maximum subarray sum) is consistent with the problem statement.
- The use of modulo `10^9 + 7` ensures that the results do not overflow and are within the required constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It handles the input as specified, performs the necessary calculations, and outputs the results correctly.

Correctness: **True**
