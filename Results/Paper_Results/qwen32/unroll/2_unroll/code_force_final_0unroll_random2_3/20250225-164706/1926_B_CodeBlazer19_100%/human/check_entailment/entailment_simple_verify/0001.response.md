### Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaws in the provided program. Let's break down the issues in detail:

1. **Triangle Detection**:
   - The program checks if any row contains exactly one `1` and immediately labels the shape as a triangle. However, a triangle can have multiple rows with different numbers of `1`s, and the program does not verify the pattern of `2*i - 1` `1`s centered in the grid or an upside-down triangle pattern.
   - The program does not account for the requirement that the `1`s must be centered and form a specific triangular pattern.

2. **Square Detection**:
   - The program checks if any row contains more than one `1` and labels the shape as a square. However, this is not sufficient to confirm that all rows have the same number of `1`s aligned to the left.
   - The program does not verify that all rows with `1`s have the same number of `1`s and that they are aligned to the left edge of the grid.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the triangle is upside-down or rotated by 90 degrees.
   - The program does not correctly identify the shape if the grid contains a triangle with more than one `1` in a row (which is possible in a triangle).

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic to identify whether the grid forms a triangle or a square based on the given conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect as it fails to accurately determine the shape based on the problem's requirements.
