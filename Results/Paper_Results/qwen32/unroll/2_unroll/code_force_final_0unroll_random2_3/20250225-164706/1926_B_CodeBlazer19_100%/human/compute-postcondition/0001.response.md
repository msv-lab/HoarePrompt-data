To determine the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `t` which represents the number of test cases.

The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be set before the loop starts, as it will be initialized by the `range` function in the first iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure that it is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100)**

Since `t` is already defined with the condition (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), it ensures that the loop will execute at least once if `t` is at least 1. No further adjustment is needed for `i` as it is controlled by the `range` function.

Final State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100)**
