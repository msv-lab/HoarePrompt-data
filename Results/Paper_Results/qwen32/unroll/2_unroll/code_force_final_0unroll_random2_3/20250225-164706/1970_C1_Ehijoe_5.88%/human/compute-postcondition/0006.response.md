The code snippet `idx = tree.index(start)` finds the index of the `start` value within the `tree` deque and assigns it to the variable `idx`. The values of `n`, `t`, the edges, and the `tree` deque remain unchanged. The variable `empty` and the initial state of `start` remain the same as well. The only change is the introduction of the new variable `idx` with a specific value based on the position of `start` in `tree`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input, `t` is the second integer read from the input, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 <= u, v <= n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers (u_1) representing the starting node of the stone where 1 <= u_1 <= n, `tree` is a deque containing all n nodes in the correct order from one leaf to the other, `empty` is False, `start` is the integer read from the input, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`.**
