The function reads input representing a tree with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges, ensuring the tree has exactly two leaves. It also reads a starting node `u_1`. Based on the structure of the tree and the starting node, it determines if the stone can be moved to a leaf in an odd number of steps. If so, it prints "Ron"; otherwise, it prints "Hermione".
