Postcondition: **`n` is the first integer read from the input, `t` is the second integer read from the input, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 <= u, v <= n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers (u_1) representing the starting node of the stone where 1 <= u_1 <= n, `tree` is a deque containing all n nodes in the correct order from one leaf to the other, `empty` is False, `start` is the integer read from the input, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, `moves` is `[min(t, idx), min(t, n - idx - 1)]`. At least one of the values in `moves` is odd, or all elements in `moves` are even numbers.**
