You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func()` does not take any input parameters directly. Instead, it interacts with an external system to receive the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), and for each test case, it receives an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a secret permutation `p` of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The function can issue queries in the form of "? a b c d" where 0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n to receive comparisons of bitwise OR operations on elements of `p`. The function must find two indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized, using at most 3n queries per test case. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program attempts to find a pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using a series of queries. However, the logic in the program is flawed and does not guarantee that it will find the correct pair of indices in all cases.

Let's break down the program's logic:

1. **Finding the "greatest" element using OR comparisons:**
   - The program iterates through the list and compares the OR of the current element with the OR of a previously found "greatest" element.
   - It updates the "greatest" element if the OR of the current element is greater.
   - This step is intended to find an element with a high OR value, but it doesn't necessarily find the element that will maximize the XOR value with another element.

2. **Finding the second element to maximize XOR:**
   - The program then iterates through the list again and compares the OR of the "greatest" element with the OR of the current element and a previously found "second" element.
   - It updates the "second" element if the OR of the "greatest" element with the current element is greater than the OR of the "greatest" element with the "second" element.
   - This step is intended to find a second element that, when XORed with the "greatest" element, will yield a high XOR value, but it doesn't guarantee that the XOR value is maximized.

The main issue with this approach is that it relies heavily on the OR operation to infer information about the XOR operation, which is not a direct relationship. The OR operation can be dominated by a single high bit, while the XOR operation considers the differences in bit positions. Therefore, the program might not correctly identify the pair of elements that maximize the XOR value.

### Counterexample:
Consider the permutation \( p = [0, 3, 1, 2] \):

- The program might first find \( v1 = 3 \) as the "greatest" element because \( 3 \mid 3 = 3 \) is greater than \( 0 \mid 0 = 0 \), \( 1 \mid 1 = 1 \), and \( 2 \mid 2 = 2 \).
- Then, it might compare \( 3 \mid 0 \), \( 3 \mid 1 \), and \( 3 \mid 2 \) with \( 3 \mid 3 \) and find \( prev = 0 \) because \( 3 \mid 0 = 3 \) is not greater than \( 3 \mid 3 = 3 \), \( 3 \mid 1 = 3 \) is not greater than \( 3 \mid 3 = 3 \), and \( 3 \mid 2 = 3 \) is not greater than \( 3 \mid 3 = 3 \).
- As a result, the program outputs \( ! 0 3 \), which is incorrect because \( 2 \oplus 3 = 1 \oplus 3 = 3 \) is the maximum XOR value, not \( 0 \oplus 3 = 3 \).

Thus, the program does not guarantee to find the correct pair of indices for all cases, making it incorrect.
