Output State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split string into an integer, returning the result as a list of integers.**

Explanation: The initial state mentions that `I` is a lambda function that performs the described operation, but the code snippet provided redefines `R` with the same functionality. Therefore, `R` now holds the lambda function, and all other preconditions remain unchanged.
