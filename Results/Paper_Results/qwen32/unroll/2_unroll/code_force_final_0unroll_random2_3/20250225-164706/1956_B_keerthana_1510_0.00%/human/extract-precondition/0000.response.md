Precondition: **Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of cards each player receives, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the integers on the cards in your hand. The integer n appears at most twice in the list a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
