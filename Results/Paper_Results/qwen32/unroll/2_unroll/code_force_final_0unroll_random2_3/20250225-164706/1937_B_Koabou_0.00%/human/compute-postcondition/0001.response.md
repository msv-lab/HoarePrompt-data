The code snippet `n = int(input())` will read an integer input and assign it to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, after executing this line, `n` will hold the value of the input integer, which will still be within this range. The other variables `t` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; each of the two binary strings provided for a test case is of length `n` and consists only of the characters '0' and '1'; `a` is an empty list.**
