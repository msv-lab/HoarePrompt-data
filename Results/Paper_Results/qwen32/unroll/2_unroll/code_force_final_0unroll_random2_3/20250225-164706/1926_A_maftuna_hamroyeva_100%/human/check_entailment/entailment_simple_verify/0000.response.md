### Reasoning:
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal. However, let's carefully re-evaluate the problem description and the program's behavior.

The problem description specifies that the output should be one of the letters ('A' or 'B') denoting the character that appears most frequently in the string. It does not specify a particular behavior when the counts are equal. Thus, consistently choosing one of the letters ('A' or 'B') when the counts are equal is a valid approach, as long as the program adheres to a consistent rule.

The given program does handle the tie case by consistently choosing 'B' when the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal. This behavior is consistent and does not violate the problem's requirements since the problem allows for either 'A' or 'B' to be printed in the case of a tie.

Therefore, the original assessment is incorrect because the program is consistent in its behavior for all cases, including ties, and adheres to the problem's requirements.

### Final: **True**
