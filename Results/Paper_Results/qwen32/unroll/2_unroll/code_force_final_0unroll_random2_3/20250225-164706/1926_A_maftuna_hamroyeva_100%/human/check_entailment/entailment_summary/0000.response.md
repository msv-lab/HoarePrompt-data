Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. For each string, it counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' and then compares these counts to determine which character appears most frequently. The program prints 'A' if 'A' appears more times than 'B', and it prints 'B' otherwise, including the case where the counts are equal. This behavior aligns with the problem description and the provided example output. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
