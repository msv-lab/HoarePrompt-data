You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        l = 0
        h = 0
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, and for each of the t test cases, there is a string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings are distinct.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        l = 0
        
        h = 0
        
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State: a sequence of 'A's and 'B's, one for each test case, indicating the majority character in each string.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the provided Python program step by step and compare it to the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Input**: 
  - An integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) indicating the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, a string of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B' characters.
  
- **Output**:
  - For each string, output the character ('A' or 'B') that appears most frequently.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates `t` times, each time reading a string of length 5.

2. **Counting Characters**:
   - For each string, the program initializes two counters, `l` and `h`, to zero.
   - It then iterates through each character in the string.
   - If the character is 'A', it increments `l`.
   - If the character is 'B', it increments `h`.

3. **Determining the Most Frequent Character**:
   - After counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', the program compares the two counters.
   - If `l` (the count of 'A') is greater than `h` (the count of 'B'), it prints 'A'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'B'.

### Evaluation:
- The program correctly handles the input format and processes each string independently.
- It accurately counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string.
- It correctly determines and prints the most frequent character in each string.
- The logic is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles cases where the string has an equal number of 'A's and 'B's by defaulting to 'B' if they are equal. This is acceptable based on the problem description, as it does not specify a tie-breaking rule.

### Conclusion:
The program meets all the requirements of the problem description and correctly solves the problem for all valid inputs.
