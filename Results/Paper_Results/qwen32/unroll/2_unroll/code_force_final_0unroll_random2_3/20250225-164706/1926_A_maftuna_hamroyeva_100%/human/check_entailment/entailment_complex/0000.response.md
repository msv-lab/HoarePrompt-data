### Reasoning:
The provided program is designed to solve the problem as described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` from the input.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, it reads a string `a` of length 5.
3. **Count Characters**: It initializes two counters, `l` and `h`, to zero. These counters will keep track of the number of 'A's and 'B's in the string, respectively.
4. **Increment Counters**: It iterates over each character in the string `a`. If the character is 'A', it increments `l`. Otherwise, it increments `h`.
5. **Determine Majority Character**: After counting the characters, it compares the values of `l` and `h`. If `l` (the count of 'A's) is greater than `h` (the count of 'B's), it prints 'A'. Otherwise, it prints 'B'.
6. **Handling Ties**: The current implementation prints 'B' if the counts are equal, which aligns with the problem statement's output example for the case "ABABA" where both 'A' and 'B' appear 3 times.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example input:

- For "ABABB", there are 3 'A's and 2 'B's, so the output is 'A'.
- For "ABABA", there are 3 'A's and 2 'B's, so the output is 'A'.
- For "BBBAB", there are 3 'B's and 2 'A's, so the output is 'B'.
- For "AAAAA", there are 5 'A's and 0 'B's, so the output is 'A'.
- For "BBBBB", there are 5 'B's and 0 'A's, so the output is 'B'.
- For "BABAA", there are 3 'A's and 2 'B's, so the output is 'A'.
- For "AAAAB", there are 4 'A's and 1 'B', so the output is 'A'.
- For "BAAAA", there are 4 'A's and 1 'B', so the output is 'A'.

The program's output matches the expected output for all test cases in the example.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the most frequently occurring character ('A' or 'B') in each string of length 5. It handles ties by printing 'B' when the counts are equal, which is consistent with the problem statement's example.

**Correctness: True**
