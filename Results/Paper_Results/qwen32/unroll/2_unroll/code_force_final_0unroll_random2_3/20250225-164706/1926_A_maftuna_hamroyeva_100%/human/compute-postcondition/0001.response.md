To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(t):`, so the variables of interest are `i` and `t`.

### Analysis:
- **`t`**: This variable determines how many times the loop will iterate. Since `t` is given as an integer read from input such that `1 <= t <= 32`, it is already in a valid state for the loop to execute as long as it is within this range.
- **`i`**: This variable is the loop index and is automatically initialized by the `range` function. Therefore, we do not need to manually adjust `i` before the loop starts. The `range` function will handle its initialization and incrementation.

### Conclusion:
The only variable that needs to be ensured for the loop to execute is `t`, which must be within the range `1 <= t <= 32`. The variable `i` does not need to be adjusted manually as it is controlled by the `range` function.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32**
