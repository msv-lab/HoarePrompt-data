You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

    #State: a series of integers, each representing the final value of `c` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and prints the minimum cost to buy a specified number of tickets (`k`) over a given number of days (`n`), where the number of tickets that can be bought per day is limited (`m`). The cost is determined based on the prices of tickets for each day, which are provided as input.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Initialization of `c`**: The variable `c` is initialized to `k * k / 2`. This value is not meaningful in the context of the problem. The variable `c` is supposed to keep track of the total cost, and starting with `k * k / 2` will lead to incorrect results.

2. **Logic for purchasing tickets**: The program attempts to purchase tickets by setting `s = min(m, k)` and then subtracting `s` from `k`. This logic is correct in that it ensures that you do not purchase more tickets than needed or allowed in a single day. However, the cost calculation is incorrect.

3. **Cost Calculation**: The cost is calculated as `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`. This expression does not correctly account for the price increase on subsequent days. The price increase should be applied to all remaining days after a purchase, but the program does not do this.

4. **Handling of price increase**: The program does not correctly handle the price increase. After purchasing `s` tickets on day `i`, the prices for all subsequent days should be increased by `s`. The program does not update the list `l` to reflect these increased prices.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2 3
8 6 4 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
10
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
The program will not produce the correct output because of the incorrect cost calculation and price increase handling.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cost = 0
        while k > 0:
            prices.sort()
            max_tickets = min(m, k)
            cost += max_tickets * prices[0]
            k -= max_tickets
            prices = [price + max_tickets for price in prices]
        print(cost)

func()
```

In this corrected version:
- The prices are sorted at the beginning of each iteration.
- The maximum number of tickets that can be bought on the cheapest available day is determined.
- The cost is updated by adding the cost of the tickets bought.
- The number of tickets needed (`k`) is reduced by the number of tickets bought.
- The prices for all days are increased by the number of tickets bought on the current day.

This ensures that the program correctly handles the price increase and calculates the minimum cost to purchase the required number of tickets.
