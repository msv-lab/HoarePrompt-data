### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the flaw in the provided program. The function `func_1` calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, which does not necessarily minimize the total penalty as required by the problem description.

To minimize the total penalty, we need to consider optimal splits of the array `a` such that the penalty for each subarray is minimized. The current implementation does not perform any splitting or consider multiple possible splits to find the minimum penalty.

Here are some key points to consider:
1. **Problem Requirement**: The goal is to split the array into subarrays such that the sum of penalties of these subarrays is minimized.
2. **Penalty Calculation**: The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of the sum of its elements multiplied by its length.
3. **Optimal Splitting**: The provided function does not attempt to find the optimal splits. It only calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which does not lead to an optimal solution.

### Evaluation of the Annotations:
The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function call. They highlight that the function `func_1` calculates and returns the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum penalty. It only calculates a single value based on the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is not sufficient to solve the problem as described.

**Final: False**
