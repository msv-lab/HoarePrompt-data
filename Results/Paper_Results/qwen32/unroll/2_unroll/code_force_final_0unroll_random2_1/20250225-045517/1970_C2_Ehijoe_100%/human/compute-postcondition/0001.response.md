The provided code snippet initializes an empty list called `edges`. This does not affect the values of `nodes`, `start`, `n`, or `t`. The `nodes` variable remains a defaultdict of lists, `start` remains an integer representing the starting node, `n` remains the first integer read from the input, and `t` remains the second integer read from the input.

Output State: **`nodes` is a defaultdict of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` nodes, `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `1 <= start <= n`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, and `t` is the second integer read from the input; `edges` is an empty list.**
