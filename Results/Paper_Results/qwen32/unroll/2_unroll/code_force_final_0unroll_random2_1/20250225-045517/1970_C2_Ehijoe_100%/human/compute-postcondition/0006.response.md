The code snippet provided initializes a variable `leaves` as a `deque` (double-ended queue). This action does not affect any of the previously defined variables (`nodes`, `start`, `n`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`). The only change is the introduction of the `leaves` variable, which is now a `deque`.

Output State: **`nodes` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node (from 1 to n) and its value is a list of adjacent nodes as defined by the edges input, `start` remains the same integer representing the starting node, `n` remains the first integer read from the input, `t` remains the second integer read from the input, `edges` remains an empty list, `empty` remains True, `leaves` is a deque**.
