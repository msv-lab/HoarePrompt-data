Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`.
   - `r` is a list of integers.
   - `n` is `r[0]`.
   - `m` is `r[1]`.
   - `x1` is `r[2] + y2` if `y1` is greater than `y2`, otherwise `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + m - y2`.
   - `y1` is `r[3] + 1` if `y2` is greater than `r[3] + 1`, otherwise `y1` is `r[3] - 1`.
   - `x2` is `x2 - a`.
   - `y2` is `r[5]`.
   - `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` remain as described in the initial state.
   - Either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`.
   - `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
   - If `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, `a` is `y2 - 1`. If `y1` is less than `y2`, `a` is `m - y2`.
   - `b` is `x2 - x1`, which is an even positive integer if `x2 > x1`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print('draw')`.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The print statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'draw'`.

4. **Output**:
   - The output of the print statement is the string `'draw'`.

Output: **draw**
