You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/d2faa6ca73d70e765c2cc6ef0834e24c2e4a5528.png)
Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases and potential scenarios as described in the problem statement. Here are some specific issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Draw Condition**: The program incorrectly determines the draw condition. For example, if Alice and Bob are in positions where neither can make a move, the program should output "Draw". However, the program does not correctly handle scenarios where Alice or Bob is in the last or first row respectively, which should result in a draw.

2. **Incorrect Movement Logic**: The movement logic in the program is flawed. For example, the program incorrectly updates the positions of Alice and Bob after checking certain conditions, which does not accurately reflect the game rules. The program does not correctly simulate the optimal moves for both players.

3. **Incorrect Victory Conditions**: The program incorrectly determines the victory conditions. For example, the program does not correctly check if Alice or Bob can move to the other player's position in the next move.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Even and Odd Differences**: The program incorrectly handles cases where the difference in the x-coordinates of Alice and Bob is even or odd. The logic for determining the winner based on the difference in coordinates is flawed.

Here is a counterexample where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
```
1
3 3 1 1 3 3
```
Expected Output:
```
Draw
```
Actual Output:
```
bob
```

Explanation of the Counterexample:
- Alice starts at (1, 1) and Bob starts at (3, 3).
- Alice cannot move up, left, or up-left since she is in the first row and first column.
- Bob cannot move down, right, or down-right since he is in the last row and last column.
- Since neither player can make a move, the game should end in a draw.

The program incorrectly determines that Bob wins in this scenario, which is not consistent with the problem description.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
