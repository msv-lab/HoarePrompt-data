Postcondition: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `r` is a list of integers; `n` is `r[0]`; `m` is `r[1]`; `x1` is `r[2] + y2` if `y1` is greater than `y2`, otherwise `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + m - y2`; `y1` is `r[3] + 1` if `y2` is greater than `r[3] + 1`, otherwise `y1` is `r[3] - 1`; `x2` is `x2 - a`; `y2` is `r[5]`; `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` remain as described in the initial state; `x2` is greater than `x1`; the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even; `y1` is not equal to `y2`. Additionally, `y2` is less than or equal to `y1`, `a` is `y2 - 1`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, which is an even positive integer. `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.**
