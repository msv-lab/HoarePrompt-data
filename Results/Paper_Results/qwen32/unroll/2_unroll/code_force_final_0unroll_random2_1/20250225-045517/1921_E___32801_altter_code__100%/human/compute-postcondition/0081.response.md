To determine what will be printed by the `print('draw')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the conditions provided. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the variables and their values based on the given initial state:

1. **Variables from the List `r`:**
   - `n = r[0]`
   - `m = r[1]`
   - `x1 = r[2] + a`
   - `x2 = r[4] - a`
   - `y2 = r[5]` if `y1 <= y2`, otherwise `y2 = y2 + (m - y1)`

2. **Variable `a`:**
   - `a = 1 - 1` if `y1 <= y2`, otherwise `a = m - y1`
   - Simplifies to `a = 0` if `y1 <= y2`, otherwise `a = m - y1`

3. **Variable `b`:**
   - `b = x2 - x1`

4. **Variable `y1`:**
   - `y1 = 1` if `y1 <= y2`, otherwise `y1 = m`

5. **Variable `t`:**
   - `t = abs(y2 - 1)` if `y1 <= y2`, otherwise `t = abs(y2 - y1)`

6. **Variable `c`:**
   - `c = t`

7. **Conditions:**
   - At least one of the following conditions is false:
     - `b // 2 > a`
     - `abs(x2 - c) >= x1 + c`
     - `1 <= y1 <= m`
     - `1 <= x1 <= n`

The `print('draw')` statement will execute regardless of the values of the variables, as it is a simple print statement with a constant string 'draw'. Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **draw**
