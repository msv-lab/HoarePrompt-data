### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning using the annotated code and the problem description.

1. **Input Reading and Preprocessing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Set Operations**:
   - The program converts arrays `a` and `b` to sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` to get unique elements.
   - It filters these sets to include only elements that are \(\leq k\), resulting in `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.

3. **Partitioning**:
   - The program partitions the elements into three sets:
     - `only_a`: Elements that are only in `a` and are \(\leq k\).
     - `only_b`: Elements that are only in `b` and are \(\leq k\).
     - `both`: Elements that are in both `a` and `b` and are \(\leq k\).

4. **Validation**:
   - The program checks if the number of elements in `only_a` exceeds \(\frac{k}{2}\). If it does, it appends "NO" and continues to the next test case.
   - Similarly, it checks if the number of elements in `only_b` exceeds \(\frac{k}{2}\). If it does, it appends "NO" and continues to the next test case.
   - The program then checks if the total number of distinct elements (from `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`) is less than \(k\). If it is, it appends "NO" and continues to the next test case.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it appends "YES".

### Evaluation Using Annotations

- **State of the program right before the function call**:
  - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
  - Each test case is described by three integers \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\) where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot \min(n, m)\), and \(k\) is even.
  - `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^6\).
  - `b` is a list of \(m\) integers where each integer \(b_j\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_j \leq 10^6\).
  - The sum of all \(n\) and \(m\) over all test cases does not exceed \(4 \cdot 10^5\).

- **State within the function `func_1`**:
  - `unique_a` and `unique_b` are sets of unique elements from `a` and `b`, respectively.
  - `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` are sets of elements from `unique_a` and `unique_b` that are \(\leq k\).
  - `only_a` and `only_b` are sets of elements that are unique to `a` and `b`, respectively, and are \(\leq k\).
  - `both` is a set of elements that are common to both `a` and `b` and are \(\leq k\).
  - The program checks the constraints:
    - If `len(only_a) > k // 2`, it appends "NO".
    - If `len(only_b) > k // 2`, it appends "NO".
    - If `total_distinct < k`, it appends "NO".
    - Otherwise, it appends "YES".

### Correctness Evaluation

- **Uniqueness**: Using sets ensures that we only consider unique elements.
- **Partitioning**: The partitioning into `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` is correct.
- **Constraints Checking**:
  - The check `if len(only_a) > k // 2` ensures that we do not choose more than \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from array `a` that are not in `b`.
  - Similarly, `if len(only_b) > k // 2` ensures the same for array `b`.
  - The check `if total_distinct < k` ensures that we have enough distinct elements to cover all integers from 1 to \(k\).

### Conclusion

The logic in the program is sound and correctly implements the constraints and checks described in the problem statement. The program correctly determines whether it is possible to choose exactly \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from each array such that every integer from 1 to \(k\) is included among the chosen elements.
