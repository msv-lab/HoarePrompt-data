Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `path`, which is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*'. It calculates the maximum number of '@' characters that can be collected by traversing the list from left to right, with the condition that encountering a '*' character resets the count to negative infinity, effectively disqualifying any sequence containing '*'. The function returns the maximum count of '@' characters found in any valid subsequence of `path`. If `path` is empty, it returns 0.**
