Postcondition: **`path` is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*', `n` is the length of `path` and `n` is greater than 1. If the first element of `path` is '@', then the first element of `dp` is `1`. Otherwise, the first element of `dp` is `-float('inf')`. The rest of `dp` remains a list of zeros. The second element of `path` is not '*'**
