Postcondition: **`path` is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*', and `n` is the length of `path` with `n` greater than 0. If `n` is 1, `dp` remains a list where the first element is `1` if the first element of `path` is '@', otherwise it is `-float('inf')`, and the rest of `dp` is zeros. If `n` is greater than 1, the first element of `dp` is `1` if the first element of `path` is '@', otherwise it is `-float('inf')`. The second element of `dp` is `-float('inf')` if the second element of `path` is '*', otherwise it is `dp[0] + 1` if the second element of `path` is '@', or `dp[0]` if the second element of `path` is not '@'. The rest of `dp` remains zeros.**
