You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: path is a string representing a sequence of space-separated integers, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and the integers in path represent the periodicities of the signs, each being between 1 and 10^6 inclusive.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        path = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        results.append(func_1(path))
        
    #State: `path` is the string at `data[2 * t]`, `n` is the integer value of the string at `data[2 * t - 1]`, `data` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `index` is `2 * t + 1`, and `results` contains the results of `func_1(path)` for each iteration.
    #
    #Output State:
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: path is the string at data[2 * t], n is the integer value of the string at data[2 * t - 1], data remains unchanged, t remains unchanged, index is 2 * t + 1, and results contains the results of func_1(path) for each iteration. The loop has printed each result in results to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `path`, a string representing a sequence of space-separated integers, and `n`, an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100. The integers in `path` represent the periodicities of the signs, each being between 1 and 10^6 inclusive. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
