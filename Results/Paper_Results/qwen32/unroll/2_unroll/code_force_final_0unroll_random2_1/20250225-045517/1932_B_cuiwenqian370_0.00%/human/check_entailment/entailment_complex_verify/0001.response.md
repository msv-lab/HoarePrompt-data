Reasoning: The original assessment is correct. The provided code does not solve the problem described. The problem requires determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicity of each sign, ensuring that each sign occurs sequentially. 

The provided code, however, appears to be solving a different problem related to a path with '@' and '*' characters. Specifically, `func_1` seems to be calculating the maximum number of '@' characters that can be collected by traversing a list from left to right, resetting the count to negative infinity when encountering a '*'. This functionality is entirely unrelated to the problem of determining the year when each sign occurs based on their periodicity.

The annotations support this conclusion, as they describe the behavior of `func_1` in terms of counting '@' characters and handling '*' characters, which is not relevant to the given problem. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the provided program is incorrect for the given problem.

Final: **False**
