Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not relevant to the problem at hand. The problem requires calculating the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, based on the periodicities of the signs.

The given program seems to be related to a different problem, possibly involving a path with '@' and '*' characters, and does not handle the input or output requirements specified in the problem description.

Here is a correct implementation of the problem:

```python
def find_apocalypse_year(t, cases):
    results = []
    for n, a in cases:
        current_year = 0
        for i in range(n):
            # Find the next occurrence of the i-th sign starting from the current year + 1
            next_occurrence = ((current_year // a[i]) + 1) * a[i]
            current_year = next_occurrence
        results.append(current_year)
    return results

# Example usage:
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        cases.append((n, a))
    
    results = find_apocalypse_year(t, cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Uncomment the following line to run the main function
# main()
```

This implementation correctly reads the input, calculates the year of the n-th sign's occurrence for each test case, and prints the results. The logic follows the problem description accurately by iterating through each sign and finding the next occurrence year based on the previous sign's occurrence year.
