Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not address the problem described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are unrelated to the problem at hand. The problem requires determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on the periodicities of the signs, ensuring that each subsequent sign occurs strictly after the previous one.

The annotated version of the code confirms that `func_1` processes a list of characters (`@` and `*`) and calculates some value based on this list. This is not relevant to the problem of finding the year of the n-th sign's occurrence. The `func_2` function reads input but incorrectly passes a string of space-separated integers to `func_1`, which is not designed to handle this input format.

The correct implementation provided in the original assessment reads the input correctly, calculates the year of each sign's occurrence iteratively, and outputs the results as required by the problem statement.

Final: **False**
