You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. It then prints two lists, `ans1` and `ans2`, each containing `k` integers, such that each integer in these lists appears exactly once across both lists. The integers are selected based on specific conditions related to their occurrences and positions in the input list `a`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not guarantee that the bitwise XOR of elements in `ans1` will always be equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `ans2`. Let's analyze the logic:

1. **Initialization and Sorting:**
   - The input array `a` is split into two halves: `b` and `c`.
   - Both `b` and `c` are sorted.

2. **Building `ans1` and `ans2`:**
   - The program tries to build `ans1` and `ans2` by adding pairs of identical elements from `b` and `c`.
   - It also tries to add unique elements from `b` and `c` to `ans1` and `ans2` respectively, but the logic for ensuring the XOR equality is not robust.

3. **Handling Unique Elements:**
   - The program handles unique elements in `b` and `c` by adding them to a list `l` and then distributing them between `ans1` and `ans2`.
   - However, the distribution of these unique elements does not guarantee that the XOR of `ans1` will equal the XOR of `ans2`.

### Potential Issue:

Consider the following test case:
```
1
4 1
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
```

For this test case, the correct output could be:
```
1 2
1 2
```

However, the provided program might not always produce this output due to the way it handles unique elements. The program might end up with mismatched XOR values due to incorrect distribution of unique elements.

### Example of Incorrect Output:

Let's walk through the program with the test case:
- `b = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
- `c = [1, 2, 3, 4]`

The program might end up with:
- `ans1 = [1, 2, 3]`
- `ans2 = [1, 2, 4]`

Here, `1 ^ 2 ^ 3` is not equal to `1 ^ 2 ^ 4`, which violates the problem's requirement.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not guarantee that the bitwise XOR of the elements in `ans1` will always be equal to the bitwise XOR of the elements in `ans2` for every potential case.
