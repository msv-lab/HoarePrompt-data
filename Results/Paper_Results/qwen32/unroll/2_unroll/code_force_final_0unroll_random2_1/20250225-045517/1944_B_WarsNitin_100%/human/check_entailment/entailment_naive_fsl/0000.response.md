Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not guarantee that the bitwise XOR of elements in `ans1` will always be equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `ans2`. Let's analyze the logic:

1. **Initialization and Sorting:**
   - The input array `a` is split into two halves: `b` and `c`.
   - Both `b` and `c` are sorted.

2. **Building `ans1` and `ans2`:**
   - The program tries to build `ans1` and `ans2` by adding pairs of identical elements from `b` and `c`.
   - It also tries to add unique elements from `b` and `c` to `ans1` and `ans2` respectively, but the logic for ensuring the XOR equality is not robust.

3. **Handling Unique Elements:**
   - The program handles unique elements in `b` and `c` by adding them to a list `l` and then distributing them between `ans1` and `ans2`.
   - However, the distribution of these unique elements does not guarantee that the XOR of `ans1` will equal the XOR of `ans2`.

### Potential Issue:

Consider the following test case:
```
1
4 1
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
```

For this test case, the correct output could be:
```
1 2
1 2
```

However, the provided program might not always produce this output due to the way it handles unique elements. The program might end up with mismatched XOR values due to incorrect distribution of unique elements.

### Example of Incorrect Output:

Let's walk through the program with the test case:
- `b = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
- `c = [1, 2, 3, 4]`

The program might end up with:
- `ans1 = [1, 2, 3]`
- `ans2 = [1, 2, 4]`

Here, `1 ^ 2 ^ 3` is not equal to `1 ^ 2 ^ 4`, which violates the problem's requirement.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not guarantee that the bitwise XOR of the elements in `ans1` will always be equal to the bitwise XOR of the elements in `ans2` for every potential case.
