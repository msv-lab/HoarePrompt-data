#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5. a is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.
def func_1():
    return 0
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and always returns 0.
