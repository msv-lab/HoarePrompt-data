Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to solve the problem of finding the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed from given sticks, where each polygon must have equal sides and each stick can be used in at most one polygon. The program reads multiple test cases, and for each test case, it calculates the maximum number of polygons that can be formed.

The function `func_1` is supposed to take an array of stick lengths and return the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed. The logic in `func_1` is to count the frequency of each stick length and then determine how many squares (4-sided polygons) can be formed from each length by performing integer division of the frequency by 4.

However, the problem statement does not specify that only squares (4-sided polygons) should be considered. It asks for the maximum number of regular polygons, which could be of any number of sides (3, 4, 5, etc.). The provided function only considers squares, which is a limitation and does not align with the problem description. Therefore, the function does not correctly solve the problem as it is described.

Correctness: **False**
