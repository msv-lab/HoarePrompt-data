You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 4 for v in freq.values()))



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the list contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the stick lengths.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the list contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the stick lengths; `freq` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `arr` and values as their respective counts in `arr`.
    return sum(v // 4 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the dictionary `freq` by 4.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed from given sticks, with the condition that each side of a polygon must be formed by exactly one stick, and no stick can be used in more than one polygon. 

The program reads multiple test cases, where for each test case, it receives the number of sticks and their respective lengths. It then calculates the frequency of each stick length and determines how many sets of 4 sticks of the same length can be formed (since the smallest regular polygon is a triangle, but to simplify and match the provided function, it assumes the smallest polygon is a square, which requires 4 sticks of the same length). The sum of these sets across all stick lengths gives the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The problem description does not specify that the polygons must be squares (4-sided). Regular polygons can have any number of sides greater than or equal to 3. Therefore, the function `func_1` should consider forming polygons with the smallest possible number of sides (triangles, 3-sided polygons) rather than only considering squares (4-sided polygons). 

The current implementation will only count the number of squares that can be formed, which is not the correct approach for the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
