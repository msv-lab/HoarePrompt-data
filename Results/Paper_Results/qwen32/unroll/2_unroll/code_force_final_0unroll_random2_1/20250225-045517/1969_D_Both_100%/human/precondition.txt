The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; 0 ≤ k ≤ n), followed by two lines containing n integers each. The first line contains the prices a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) for Alice, and the second line contains the prices b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9) for Bob. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
