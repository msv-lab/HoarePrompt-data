To determine the Output State, we need to understand what `func_1()` does. Since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the provided context, we can only assume that it returns some value or modifies certain variables based on its implementation. However, since the implementation of `func_1()` is not given, we can only infer that `test_cases` will be assigned the value returned by `func_1()`.

Given that no other variables are modified by the provided code snippet, the only change is the assignment of `test_cases` to the return value of `func_1()`.

Output State: **heap is a list that will be used as a min-heap, remaining_items is an initially empty list, n is a positive integer representing the number of items, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n, prices is a list of n integers representing the prices for Alice, neg_prices is a list of n integers representing the negative prices for Alice, bonuses is a list of n integers representing the bonuses for Bob, max_profit is initialized to 0, current_profit is initialized to 0, combined is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a negative price and a bonus, and combined is sorted by the bonus values, test_cases is the return value of func_1()**.
