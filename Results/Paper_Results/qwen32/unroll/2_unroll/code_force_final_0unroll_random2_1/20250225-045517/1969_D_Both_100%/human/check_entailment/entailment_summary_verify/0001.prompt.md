You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function calculates and prints the maximum profit that can be achieved for Bob and Alice based on given prices, bonuses, and constraints. It processes multiple test cases, each involving a list of prices, bonuses, and a limit on the number of items that can be selected to maximize the profit.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Objective**: Alice wants to maximize her profit, while Bob wants to minimize it.
2. **Profit Calculation**: Alice's profit is defined as the sum of the prices Bob pays minus the sum of the prices Alice pays.
3. **Bob's Strategy**:
   - If Alice buys fewer than `k` items, Bob can take all items for free.
   - If Alice buys `k` or more items, Bob takes `k` items for free and pays for the rest.
4. **Alice's Strategy**:
   - Alice needs to choose a subset of items to buy such that her profit is maximized after Bob's optimal response.

### Key Points

- The problem can be approached by sorting items based on the difference between Bob's price and Alice's price (`b_i - a_i`).
- Alice should consider buying items with the highest `b_i - a_i` differences to maximize her profit.
- Bob will take the `k` items with the highest `b_i - a_i` differences for free, so Alice should avoid these items or ensure she gets a better profit from the remaining items.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of items) and `k` (number of items Bob can take for free).
   - It then reads two lists: `prices` (Alice's prices) and `bonuses` (Bob's prices).

2. **Processing Logic**:
   - The program combines the negative of Alice's prices (`neg_prices`) and Bob's prices (`bonuses`) into a list of tuples.
   - It sorts this list based on Bob's prices (`bonuses`).
   - It pushes the first `k` items into a heap (priority queue).
   - It calculates the initial profit by summing the `bonuses` of the remaining items and adjusting for the `neg_prices` of these items.
   - It iteratively updates the profit by considering each remaining item and adjusting the heap to maintain the optimal subset of items Alice should buy.

3. **Heap Usage**:
   - The heap is used to keep track of the `k` items with the highest `b_i - a_i` differences.
   - The program ensures that Alice avoids buying these items or gets a better profit from the remaining items.

### Correctness

The program seems to follow a logical approach to solving the problem. It sorts items based on the difference between Bob's and Alice's prices and uses a heap to maintain the optimal subset of items Alice should buy. The logic for updating the profit and maintaining the heap is consistent with the problem's requirements.

However, there are a few points to consider:
- The program uses `heapq` to maintain a priority queue, which is appropriate for this problem.
- The logic for calculating the profit and adjusting the heap seems correct, but the implementation details need to be verified.
- The program handles the constraints efficiently, given the input size limits.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the problem and the provided program, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The use of sorting and a priority queue ensures that Alice can maximize her profit while considering Bob's optimal response.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
