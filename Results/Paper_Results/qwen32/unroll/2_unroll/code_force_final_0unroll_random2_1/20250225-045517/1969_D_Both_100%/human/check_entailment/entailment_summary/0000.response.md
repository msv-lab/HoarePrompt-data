### Reasoning:

The program consists of four functions, with `func_4` being the main function that processes each test case. Here is a detailed breakdown of the logic and correctness of each part of the program:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - `func_1` reads a single integer from the input, which is used to determine the number of test cases.
   - `func_2` reads a line of input and splits it into multiple integers, which are used for the number of items `n`, the number of free items Bob can take `k`, the list of prices for Alice `a_i`, and the list of prices for Bob `b_i`.

2. **Logic for Calculating Profit**:
   - `func_3` calculates the total profit based on the items in `primary_items` and `secondary_heap`. It sums up the elements of `secondary_heap` and adds the sum of the elements of tuples in `primary_items` where the sum of the tuple's elements is non-negative.
   - `func_4` is the main function that processes each test case:
     - It initializes a heap (priority queue) and a list `remaining_items`.
     - It reads `n` and `k`, along with the lists of prices for Alice and Bob.
     - It negates the prices for Alice to use a min-heap as a max-heap.
     - It combines the negated prices and bonuses into a list of tuples and sorts it based on the bonuses.
     - It pushes the first `k` items into the heap.
     - It calculates the initial profit using `func_3` if there are items left after pushing `k` items into the heap.
     - It iterates through the remaining items, adjusting the profit by considering the current item and the item removed from the heap.
     - It updates the maximum profit whenever a higher profit is found.
     - Finally, it prints the maximum profit for the current test case.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the input and processes each test case independently.
   - The logic for calculating the profit considers both Alice's and Bob's optimal strategies: Alice tries to maximize her profit, while Bob tries to minimize it by choosing the best `k` items to take for free.
   - The use of a heap ensures efficient management of the items, and the sorting of items based on bonuses helps in making the optimal choices.
   - The example test cases provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program, producing the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program is correctly implemented and meets the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
