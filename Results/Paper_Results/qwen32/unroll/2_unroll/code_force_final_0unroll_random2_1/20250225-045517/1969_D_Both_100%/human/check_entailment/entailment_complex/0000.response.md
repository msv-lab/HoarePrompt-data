### Reasoning:

The provided Python code is designed to solve the problem of calculating Alice's maximum profit in a game where she and Bob interact over the purchase of items with different prices. The functions are:

1. **func_1()**: Reads an integer from the standard input.
2. **func_2()**: Reads a line of integers from the standard input and converts them to a map object of integers.
3. **func_3(primary_items, secondary_heap)**: Computes the total profit based on the items Alice buys and the items Bob can take for free. It sums the prices of items in `secondary_heap` and adds the sum of `a_i + b_i` for items in `primary_items` where `a_i + b_i` is non-negative.
4. **func_4()**: Orchestrates the main logic. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by reading the number of items `n` and the number of items Bob can take for free `k`, the prices for Alice (`prices`), the prices for Bob (`bonuses`), and computes the maximum profit using a heap to keep track of the items Bob can take for free.

The logic in `func_4()` follows these steps:
- For each test case, it initializes a heap and reads input values.
- It sorts items based on Bob's bonuses.
- It pushes the first `k` items into the heap.
- It calculates the initial profit from the remaining items.
- It iteratively processes the remaining items, adjusting the profit based on whether adding an item increases the profit.
- It keeps track of the maximum profit encountered.

The use of a heap ensures that Bob always takes the items with the highest bonuses first, minimizing Alice's profit effectively.

### Correctness:

The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the constraints and edge cases, such as when `k` is 0 (Bob can take all items for free), and when `k` equals `n` (Bob takes exactly `k` items for free). The provided example cases are also correctly handled.

Therefore, the code is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
