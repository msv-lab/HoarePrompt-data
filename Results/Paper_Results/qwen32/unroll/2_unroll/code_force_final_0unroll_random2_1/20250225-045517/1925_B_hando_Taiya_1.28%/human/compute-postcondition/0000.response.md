The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `n`. The initial state specifies the ranges for `t`, `x`, and `n`, but after the code execution, only `x` and `n` are updated with the specific values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= x.**
