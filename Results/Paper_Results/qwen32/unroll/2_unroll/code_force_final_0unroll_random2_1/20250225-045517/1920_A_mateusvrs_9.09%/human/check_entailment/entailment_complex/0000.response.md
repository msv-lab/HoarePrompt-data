### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify its correctness based on the problem statement and the given example.

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it initializes:
     - `cx` as an empty set to store values that `k` must not be equal to.
     - `ax` to a very large number (`1000000000 + 7`) to find the smallest upper bound.
     - `bx` to `-1` to find the largest lower bound.

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - For each constraint in the test case:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (`k >= x`), it updates `bx` to be the maximum of its current value and `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (`k <= x`), it updates `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (`k != x`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Determine Valid Range:**
   - After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx >= ax`. If true, it means there is no valid `k` that satisfies all constraints, so it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that are not in the set `cx`. This is done by iterating over `cx` and counting how many elements are within the range `[bx, ax]`. The result is then computed as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of such elements.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program prints all results for each test case.

### Verification:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

#### Example Test Case 1:
```
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```
- Constraints:
  - `k >= 3`
  - `k <= 10`
  - `k != 1`
  - `k != 5`
- Valid `k` values: `3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10` (7 values).
- The program correctly calculates this.

#### Example Test Case 2:
```
2
1 5
2 4
```
- Constraints:
  - `k >= 5`
  - `k <= 4`
- No valid `k` values (0 values).
- The program correctly calculates this.

#### Example Test Case 3:
```
10
3 6
3 7
1 2
1 7
3 100
3 44
2 100
2 98
1 3
3 99
```
- Constraints:
  - `k >= 7`
  - `k <= 98`
  - `k != 6`
  - `k != 7`
  - `k != 100`
  - `k != 44`
  - `k != 99`
- Valid `k` values: `8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97` (90 values).
- The program correctly calculates this.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case based on the given problem description and examples.

Correctness: **True**
