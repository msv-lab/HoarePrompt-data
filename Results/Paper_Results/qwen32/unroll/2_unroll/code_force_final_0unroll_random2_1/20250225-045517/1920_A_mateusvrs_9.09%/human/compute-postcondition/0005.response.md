Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (representing the number of constraints, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a series of constraints. Each constraint is defined by two integers `a` and `x`, where `a` can be 1, 2, or 3, and `1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9`. If `a=1`, `k` must be greater than or equal to `x`. If `a=2`, `k` must be less than or equal to `x`. If `a=3`, `k` must be not equal to `x`. The function returns `True` if there exists an integer `k` that satisfies all the constraints for a test case; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
