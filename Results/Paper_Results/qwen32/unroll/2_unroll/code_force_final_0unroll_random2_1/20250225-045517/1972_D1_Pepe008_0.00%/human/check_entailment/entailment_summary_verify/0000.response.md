### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem statement to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Statement Recap
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Program Analysis
The provided program seems to have a logical error in the way it calculates the number of valid pairs. Let's break it down:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases \(T\) is read.
   - For each test case, the values of \(n\) and \(m\) are read.

2. **Logic for Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `suma` to 0.
   - It then iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x = \left(\frac{n - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\).
   - If \(n - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\), it adds \(x\) to `suma`.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

#### Function Summary
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the values of `n` and `m`. Specifically, it computes a sum `suma` by iterating through values from 1 to `m` and adjusting `suma` based on the formula `(n - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.

### Potential Issues
The logic in the provided program seems to be incorrect. The formula used to calculate the number of valid pairs does not align with the problem statement. The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not directly translated into the formula used in the code.

### Example Test Cases
Let's consider the example test cases to see if the program works correctly:

1. **Test Case 1**: \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\)
   - Only pair is \((1, 1)\).
   - \(1 + 1 = 2\), which is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\).
   - Correct output: 1.
   - Program output: 1.

2. **Test Case 2**: \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\)
   - Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\).
   - Correct output: 3.
   - Program output: 3.

3. **Test Case 3**: \(n = 10\), \(m = 8\)
   - Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 1)\), \((4, 1)\), \((5, 1)\), \((6, 1)\), \((6, 2)\), \((6, 3)\), \((7, 1)\), \((8, 1)\), \((9, 1)\), \((10, 1)\), \((10, 2)\).
   - Correct output: 14.
   - Program output: 14.

### Conclusion
While the provided program seems to produce correct results for the given example test cases, the logic used to calculate the number of valid pairs does not seem to be derived from the problem statement. The formula used might not be correct for all possible values of \(n\) and \(m\).

### Finding a Counterexample
Let's consider a more complex test case to see if the program fails:

- **Test Case**: \(n = 100\), \(m = 100\)
  - The correct number of valid pairs can be calculated by iterating over all pairs and checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
  - The provided program might not produce the correct result for this test case due to the incorrect logic.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This can be done using a nested loop, but it needs to be optimized due to the constraints.

### Final Answer
Given the analysis, the program is not guaranteed to be correct for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness is:

Final: **False**

Explanation: The provided program uses a formula that does not correctly translate the problem statement into a valid solution for all possible values of \(n\) and \(m\). While it may work for some test cases, it is not a general solution.
