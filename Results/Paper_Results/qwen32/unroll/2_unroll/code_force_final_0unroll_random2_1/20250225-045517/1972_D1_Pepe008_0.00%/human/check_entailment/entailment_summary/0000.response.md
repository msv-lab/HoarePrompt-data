### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The program's logic appears to be incorrect based on the provided execution summary and the problem statement. Here are a few reasons why:

1. **Misinterpretation of the Problem:**
   - The program iterates over values of `b` from 1 to `m` and calculates a sum `suma` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. This formula does not directly relate to checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The commented-out section of the code suggests that the program was initially intended to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition directly. However, this was replaced with the current logic, which seems unrelated to the problem.

2. **Incorrect Calculation:**
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The current logic involves a different calculation that does not ensure the correct count of valid pairs.

3. **Example Mismatch:**
   - The provided execution summary does not match the expected behavior of the program as described in the problem statement. The output for the test cases does not align with the expected results based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:

Given the above points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic used in the program is not appropriate for the given problem constraints and conditions.

### Correctness: **False**
