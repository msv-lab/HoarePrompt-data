You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

    2
    
Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the algorithm used in `func_5` does not properly account for all possible ways to partition the array into segments that meet the bitwise XOR and OR conditions.

Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Partitioning**:
   - The code uses a bit-by-bit analysis starting from the most significant bit (MSB) down to the least significant bit (LSB). However, it does not correctly handle the conditions required to form the segments `[l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], \ldots, [l_k, r_k]` such that the bitwise OR of the XORs of these segments is less than or equal to `x`.
   - The logic for determining whether to split the array at a particular bit position is flawed. For example, if the bit `i` in `x` is 0, the code checks if the number of 1s in the `i`-th bit position of the array elements is even. If it is not, the function immediately returns `-1`, which is not always correct. There could be valid partitions even if the number of 1s is odd.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where the array length `n` is 1 correctly. Specifically, if `n` is 1, the only possible segment is the entire array itself. The code should check if the single element in the array is less than or equal to `x` and return 1 if true, otherwise return -1.
   - The code does not handle cases where `x` is 0 correctly. If `x` is 0, the only valid partition is one where the XOR of the segment is 0. The code should check if there is a way to partition the array such that the XOR of each segment is 0.

3. **Incorrect Use of Variables**:
   - The variable `t` is used to store intermediate results but is not utilized correctly. The code appends results to `t` but does not use it to form the final segments.
   - The variable `ans` is supposed to store the maximum number of valid segments, but it is not updated correctly in all cases.

To illustrate an incorrect case, consider the following input:

```
1
3 0
1 2 3
```

For this input, the correct output should be `-1` because the XOR of any segment will not be 0, and thus the bitwise OR of the XORs of these segments cannot be 0. However, the provided code might return an incorrect result for this case.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all potential cases, and therefore the correctness is **False**.
