To determine the correctness of the given program, let's break down the problem and the solution step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Find the maximum number `k` such that we can split the array `a` into `k` segments `[l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], ..., [l_k, r_k]` satisfying the following conditions:
   - `l_1 = 1`
   - `r_k = n`
   - `l_i <= r_i` for all `i`
   - `r_i + 1 = l_{i+1}` for all `i` from `1` to `k-1`
   - The bitwise OR of the bitwise XORs of these segments is less than or equal to `x`.

2. **Constraints**:
   - Number of test cases `t` up to `10^4`
   - Length of array `n` up to `10^5`
   - Each element of `a` and `x` is less than `2^{30}`

### Analysis of the Program:
The program provided is designed to solve the problem using bitwise operations. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the approach taken by the program:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads a line of input and returns a list of integers.
   - `func_2()`: Reads a single integer from input.
   - `func_3()`: Reads a line of input and returns a map of integers (used to read `n` and `x`).
   - `func_4()`: Reads a line of input and returns it as a string (not used in the provided code).

2. **Main Logic (`func_5()`)**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `t`: A list to store intermediate results.
     - `ans`: The maximum number of segments found, initialized to `-1`.
   - **Iterate over each bit position (from 29 to 0)**:
     - `u`: The `i`-th bit of `x`.
     - `v`: The sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`.
     - **Conditions**:
       - If both `u` and `v` are `0`, continue to the next bit.
       - If `u` is `0` and `v` is odd, return `ans` immediately (impossible to split).
       - If `u` is `0` and `v` is even, process the array to find segments where the `i`-th bit XOR is `0`.
       - If `u` is `1` and `v` is odd, continue to the next bit (impossible to split).
       - If `u` is `1` and `v` is even and non-zero, count the maximum number of segments where the `i`-th bit XOR is `0`.
       - If `u` is `1` and `v` is zero, break the loop (no more bits to process).
   - **Final Step**:
     - Return the maximum of `ans` and the length of `a` (in case no valid segments are found, the whole array is considered a segment).

### Correctness Check:
- The program iterates over each bit position and checks the conditions based on the problem statement. It correctly handles the cases where it's impossible to split the array and where the whole array can be considered a segment.
- The logic for counting segments where the `i`-th bit XOR is `0` is correct and ensures that the segments are valid.
- The final result is the maximum number of segments found or the length of the array if no valid segments are found.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
