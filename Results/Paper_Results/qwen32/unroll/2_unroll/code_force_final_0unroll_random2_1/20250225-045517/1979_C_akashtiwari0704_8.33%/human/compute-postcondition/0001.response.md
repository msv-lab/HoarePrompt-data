In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range defined by the variable `t`. The variables `n` and `k` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The only variable in the loop head is `T`, which is the loop variable iterating over `range(t)`.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The current state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, which already guarantees that the loop will execute at least once.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute. The state remains as provided.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` is an integer such that 2 <= `k_i` <= 20. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
