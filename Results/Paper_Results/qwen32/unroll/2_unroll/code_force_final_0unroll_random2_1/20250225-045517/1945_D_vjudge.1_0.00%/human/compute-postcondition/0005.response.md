The code snippet initializes the variable `soma_b` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, or `lista_B`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial values of `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, and `lista_B`, with the addition that `soma_b` is now 0.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `lista_A` is a list of integers from the input in reverse order, `lista_B` is the new list of integers from the latest input in reverse order, `soma_b` is 0.**
