The only variable in the loop head of the provided for loop is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. The other variables `n` and `a` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Given that the loop iterates `t` times, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9**.

Since the task specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, and the loop head only involves `t`, we ensure `t` is at least 1. The other conditions on `n` and `a` remain as they are since they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1**
