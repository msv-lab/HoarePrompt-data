The value of `num` is converted from an integer to a string. The precondition that `num` was an integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9 is still valid, but now `num` holds the string representation of that integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is a string representation of an integer such that 1 <= int(num) <= 10^9.

Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that 1 <= int(num) <= 10^9**.
