To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and the range parameters.

The `for` loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Here, `i` is the loop variable, and the range function is defined by three parameters:
- `len(num) - 1`: The starting value of `i` (inclusive).
- `-1`: The stopping value of `i` (exclusive).
- `-1`: The step value, indicating that `i` will decrement by 1 in each iteration.

For the loop to execute, the starting value of `i` must be greater than or equal to the stopping value. Given the range parameters, the loop will execute if `len(num) - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, which is always true as long as `num` is a non-empty string.

Since `num` is a string representation of an integer such that `1 <= int(num) <= 10^9`, it is guaranteed to be a non-empty string, and thus `len(num) - 1` will be a non-negative integer.

Therefore, the initial state of `i` does not need to be explicitly set because it is determined by the range function. However, we should ensure that `num` is a valid string representation of an integer within the specified range.

State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that 1 <= int(num) <= 10^9; `tot` is 0**
