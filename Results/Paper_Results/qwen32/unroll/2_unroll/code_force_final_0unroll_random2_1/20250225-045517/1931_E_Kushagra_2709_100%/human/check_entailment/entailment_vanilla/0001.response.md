Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine if the solution is correct.

### Problem Analysis:

In the game described, the players take turns to either reverse a number's digits (Anna's turn) or concatenate two numbers (Sasha's turn). The game ends when there is only one number left in the list. Sasha wins if this number is at least \(10^m\).

### Key Observations:

1. **Anna's Move**: Anna reverses the digits of a number. This can potentially increase or decrease the number, but the critical point is that reversing a number does not change the total number of digits in the list. It only changes the distribution of digits among the numbers.

2. **Sasha's Move**: Sasha concatenates two numbers, reducing the total number of numbers by one. Concatenation can make a very large number, potentially large enough to satisfy Sasha's winning condition.

3. **Winning Condition**: Sasha wins if the final number is at least \(10^m\). This means the number of digits in the final number must be at least \(m+1\).

### Strategy:

The strategy revolves around the total number of digits in the list. If the total number of digits is at least \(m+1\), Sasha can potentially create a number with at least \(m+1\) digits by concatenating numbers. Anna's moves do not change the total number of digits; they only redistribute them.

### Code Analysis:

Let's break down the provided code:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - `tot = sum((len(val) for val in map(str, nums)))`: This calculates the total number of digits in all numbers in the list.
    - `cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)`: This calculates the number of trailing zeros for each number and sorts these counts in descending order.
    - `for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2): tot -= cntvals[i]`: This loop subtracts the number of trailing zeros from the total number of digits for every second number in the sorted list of trailing zeros. This seems to be an attempt to account for digits that might be removed due to leading zeros after concatenation.
    - `return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'`: This checks if the adjusted total number of digits is at least \(m+1\).

2. **Function `zerocnts`**:
    - This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in a number by iterating from the end of the string representation of the number until a non-zero digit is encountered.

### Issues with the Code:

The code's logic for adjusting the total number of digits by subtracting trailing zeros for every second number is not clear and does not align with the problem's requirements. The key point is that the total number of digits should not be reduced unless it's explicitly stated that leading zeros are removed in concatenation, which is not the case here.

### Correctness:

Given the observations and the analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine the winner. The subtraction of trailing zeros for every second number is not justified and can lead to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
