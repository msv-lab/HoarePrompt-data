To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Game Mechanics**:
   - **Anna's Turn**: She reverses the digits of one number in the list.
   - **Sasha's Turn**: He concatenates two numbers in the list and replaces them with the concatenated number.

2. **Objective**:
   - Sasha wins if, after all possible moves, the remaining number is at least \(10^m\).
   - Anna wins if the remaining number is less than \(10^m\).

3. **Key Insight**:
   - The number of digits in the final number is crucial. Sasha can concatenate numbers to increase the number of digits.
   - Anna can only reverse numbers, which may increase or decrease the number of digits but cannot increase them beyond the original number's length.

4. **Winning Strategy**:
   - If the total number of digits in the list, after removing the maximum possible trailing zeros (which Anna can remove by reversing numbers), is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\), Sasha can concatenate numbers to reach at least \(10^m\).
   - Otherwise, Anna can force the final number to have fewer digits than \(m + 1\).

### Program Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Parameters**: `n` (number of integers), `m` (threshold for Sasha's win), `nums` (list of integers).
   - **Logic**:
     - Calculate the total number of digits in all numbers.
     - Sort the numbers based on the number of trailing zeros in descending order.
     - For every second number in the sorted list (starting from the first), subtract the number of trailing zeros from the total digit count.
     - If the resulting total digit count is at least \(m + 1\), Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

2. **Function `zerocnts`**:
   - **Purpose**: Count the number of trailing zeros in a number.
   - **Implementation**: Convert the number to a string and count trailing zeros from the end.

### Verification:

- The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the maximum number of digits Sasha can potentially achieve by removing trailing zeros that Anna can reverse out.
- The sorting and subtraction of trailing zeros for every second number simulate the optimal moves by Anna and Sasha.
- The condition `tot >= m + 1` correctly determines the winner based on the number of digits.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the problem description and constraints.

**Correctness: True**
