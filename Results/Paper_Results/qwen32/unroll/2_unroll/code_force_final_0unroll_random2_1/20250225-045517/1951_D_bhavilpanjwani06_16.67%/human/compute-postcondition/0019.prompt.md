You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Each of the following t test cases consists of two positive integers n and k, where 1 <= n, k <= 10^{18}.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (n < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        if (n == k) :
            print('YES')
            #This is printed: YES
            print(1)
            #This is printed: 1
            print(n)
            #This is printed: n (where n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^{18} and n is equal to k)
        else :
            if (k - 1 < n - k + 1) :
                print('YES')
                #This is printed: YES
                print(2)
                #This is printed: 2
                print(n - k + 1, 1)
                #This is printed: n - k + 1, 1
            else :
                print('NO')
                #This is printed: NO
            #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` and `k` are the two positive integers read from the input, where 1 <= n, k <= 10^{18}; `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `n` is not equal to `k`. If `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, then `k - 1 < n - k + 1`. Otherwise, `k - 1` is not less than `n - k + 1`.
        #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` and `k` are the two positive integers read from the input, where 1 <= n, k <= 10^{18}; `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `n` is equal to `k`, no changes are made. Otherwise, `n` is greater than `k` and the relationship between `k - 1` and `n - k + 1` is determined: either `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1` or `k - 1` is not less than `n - k + 1`.
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` and `k` are the two positive integers read from the input, where 1 <= n, k <= 10^{18}. If `n` is less than `k`, no changes are made. If `n` is equal to `k`, no changes are made. If `n` is greater than `k`, the relationship between `k - 1` and `n - k + 1` is determined: either `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1` or `k - 1` is not less than `n - k + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of two positive integers `n` and `k`. It processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
