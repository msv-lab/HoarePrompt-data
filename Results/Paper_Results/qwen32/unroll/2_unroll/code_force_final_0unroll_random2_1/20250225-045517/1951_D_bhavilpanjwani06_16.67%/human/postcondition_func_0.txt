The function `func_1` reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from the input and prints "YES" followed by additional information if `n` is greater than or equal to `k` and certain conditions are met; otherwise, it prints "NO". Specifically, if `n` is equal to `k`, it prints "YES", "1", and `n`. If `n` is greater than `k` and `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, it prints "YES", "2", and the values `n - k + 1` and `1`. In all other cases, it prints "NO".
