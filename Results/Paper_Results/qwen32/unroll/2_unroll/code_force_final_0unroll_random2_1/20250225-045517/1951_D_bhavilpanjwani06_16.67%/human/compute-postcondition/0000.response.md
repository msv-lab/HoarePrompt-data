The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of two positive integers `n` and `k`. After executing the code snippet, `n` and `k` will be assigned the values read from the input, but `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` and `k` are the two positive integers read from the input, where 1 <= n, k <= 10^{18}**.
