To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop in relation to the input values and the variables `t`, `day`, and `n`. The loop processes `n` inputs, each being a time in the format `HH:MM`. The variable `t` is not directly used within the loop, and `day` is initially set to 'AM'. The loop modifies the `day` variable based on the hour (`h`) of the input time.

However, the loop does not modify `t` or `n` itself; it only prints the processed time and updates the `day` variable based on the current input. Since the loop does not affect `t` and `n` in any way, their values remain the same after the loop completes.

Let's summarize the output state:
- `t` remains unchanged, so it is still an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440.
- `day` will be the result of the last time processed, either 'AM' or 'PM'.
- `n` remains unchanged as it represents the number of iterations and is not modified within the loop.

Given that the loop does not affect `t` or `n`, and `day` is determined by the last processed input, we can describe the output state as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `day` is the last determined day ('AM' or 'PM') based on the last input time, and `n` is the input integer.**
