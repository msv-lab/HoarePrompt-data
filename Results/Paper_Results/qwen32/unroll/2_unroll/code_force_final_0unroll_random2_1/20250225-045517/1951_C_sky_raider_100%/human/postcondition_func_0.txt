The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of sale days (`n`), the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased each day (`m`), and the total number of tickets to be bought (`k`). It also receives a list of prices for tickets for each day. The function calculates and prints the minimum cost required to buy `k` tickets, considering the daily purchase limits.
