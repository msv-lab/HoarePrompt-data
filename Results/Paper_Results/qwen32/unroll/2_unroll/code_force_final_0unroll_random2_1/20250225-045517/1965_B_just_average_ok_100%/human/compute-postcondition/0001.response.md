To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's analyze the code step-by-step:

1. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Initialization**: Inside the loop, a list `nums` is initialized with the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\). This means `nums` contains the values: \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]\).

3. **Finding `idx`**: The code then finds the index `idx` of the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`. This is done by iterating through the `nums` list and breaking when a power of 2 greater than `k` is found.

4. **Modifying `nums`**:
   - It appends `k - nums[idx]` to `nums`.
   - It appends `k + 1` to `nums`.
   - It appends `k + nums[idx] + 1` to `nums`.
   - It removes `nums[idx]` from `nums`.

5. **Output**: Finally, the length of the modified `nums` list and the elements of `nums` are printed.

### Key Observations:
- The length of `nums` initially is 21.
- After the modifications, `nums` will have 21 elements initially minus the one removed plus the three added, resulting in a total of 23 elements.
- The specific elements of `nums` will depend on the value of `k` but the count of elements will always be 23.

### Final Output State:
Since the number of elements in `nums` is always 23 after the modifications, and the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are not changed in a way that affects the overall count of elements in `nums` across different test cases, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **For each test case, the length of nums is 23 and it contains 23 specific elements derived from the initial powers of 2, adjusted by the value of k as described in the code.**
