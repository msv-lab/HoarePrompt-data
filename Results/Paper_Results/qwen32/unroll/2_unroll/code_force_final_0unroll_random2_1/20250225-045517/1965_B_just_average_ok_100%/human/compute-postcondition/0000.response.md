The given for loop is controlled by the variable `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is read from the input. The loop variable `_` is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use inside the loop.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to focus on the variable `t` since it is the only one mentioned in the loop head. The conditions for `t` are already provided in the problem statement: `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be an integer within this range. The other variables `n` and `k` are mentioned in the problem statement but are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000**
