You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(21)]
        idx = -1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7.

    #State: For each test case, the length of nums is 23 and it contains 23 specific elements derived from the initial powers of 2, adjusted by the value of k as described in the code.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it constructs a list of 23 specific integers derived from powers of 2, adjusted by the value of `k`. It then prints the length of this list (which is always 23) followed by the elements of the list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it meets the problem's requirements:

1. **Generating the Initial Sequence**:
   - The program starts by generating a sequence of powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\). This sequence is `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^{20}]`. The reason for this is that any integer can be represented uniquely as a sum of distinct powers of 2 (this is essentially the binary representation of numbers).

2. **Adjusting the Sequence**:
   - The program then searches for the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to \(k\). Let's call this power of 2 \(2^i\).
   - It then modifies the sequence by:
     - Adding \(k - 2^i\) to the sequence. This ensures that there is no subsequence that sums to \(k\), because \(2^i\) is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\), and \(k - 2^i\) is the smallest number that, when added to \(2^i\), equals \(k\).
     - Adding \(k + 1\) to the sequence. This ensures that there is a subsequence that sums to \(k + 1\).
     - Adding \(k + 2^i + 1\) to the sequence. This ensures that there is a subsequence that sums to \(k + 2^i + 1\).
     - Removing \(2^i\) from the sequence. This is to ensure that no subsequence can sum to \(k\) by including \(2^i\) and \(k - 2^i\).

3. **Checking the Conditions**:
   - The sequence generated by the program should satisfy the conditions:
     - No subsequence of the sequence should sum to \(k\).
     - For all \(1 \le v \le n\) where \(v \ne k\), there should be a subsequence that sums to \(v\).

However, there are some issues with the approach:
   - The removal of \(2^i\) can affect the ability to form other sums. For example, if \(k\) is a power of 2, removing it might prevent forming some sums that are less than \(k\).
   - The addition of \(k - 2^i\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 2^i + 1\) does not guarantee that all sums from 1 to \(n\) (except \(k\)) can be formed, especially for larger values of \(n\).

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `n=10, k=7`, the program might generate a sequence like `[1, 2, 4, 3, 8, 15]` (after adjustments). However, it's not clear that this sequence can form all sums from 1 to 10 except 7. For example, forming the sum 6 might be problematic.

Given the above analysis, the program does not guarantee that it will always produce a valid sequence for all possible values of \(n\) and \(k\).

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
