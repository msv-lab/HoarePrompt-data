Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k`. The function returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case. Specifically, if `k` is equal to `n`, it returns `n`; otherwise, it returns `k + 1`.**
