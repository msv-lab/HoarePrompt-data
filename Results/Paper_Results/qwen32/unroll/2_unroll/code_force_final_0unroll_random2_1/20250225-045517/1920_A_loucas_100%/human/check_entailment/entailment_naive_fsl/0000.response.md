Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, the calculation of `num = min(less) - max(big) + 1` is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility that `max(big)` could be greater than `min(less)`, which would make `num` negative. When this happens, the code should output `0` instead of a negative number. However, the code does not explicitly handle this case correctly.

Let's consider a test case:

Input:
```
1
2
1 5
2 4
```

Expected Output:
```
0
```

However, the program will output a negative number because `min(less) - max(big) + 1` will be `4 - 5 + 1 = 0`, but the program does not handle the case where `max(big)` is greater than `min(less)` correctly. In this case, the program should output `0` directly.

Another edge case to consider is when there are no `no` constraints, the program should still correctly compute the number of integers in the range `[max(big), min(less)]`.

To fix the program, we need to ensure that if `max(big)` is greater than `min(less)`, the output should be `0`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        big = []
        no = []
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            (x, a) = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        max_big = max(big)
        min_less = min(less)
        if max_big > min_less:
            print(0)
            continue
        num = min_less - max_big + 1
        for i in no:
            if i <= min_less and i >= max_big:
                num -= 1
        print(num)
```

This corrected version properly handles the case where `max(big) > min(less)` by directly printing `0`.
