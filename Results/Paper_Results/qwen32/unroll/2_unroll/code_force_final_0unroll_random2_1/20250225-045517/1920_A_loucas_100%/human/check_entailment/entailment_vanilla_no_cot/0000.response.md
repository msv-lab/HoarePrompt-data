Correctness: **False**

The given program has a logical error in how it calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. Specifically, the line `num = min(less) - max(big) + 1` assumes that all integers from `max(big)` to `min(less)` are valid unless excluded by constraints of type 3. However, this calculation does not account for the possibility that `max(big)` could be greater than `min(less)`, which would make `num` negative or zero, even if there are valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        big = []
        no = []
        num = 0
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            (x, a) = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        min_less = min(less)
        max_big = max(big)
        if max_big > min_less:
            print(0)
            continue
        num = min_less - max_big + 1
        for i in no:
            if max_big <= i <= min_less:
                num -= 1
        print(num)

func()
```

In this corrected version, the program first checks if `max_big` is greater than `min_less`. If so, it immediately prints `0` because there are no integers `k` that can satisfy both `k >= max_big` and `k <= min_less`. If `max_big` is not greater than `min_less`, it proceeds to calculate the number of valid integers and subtracts the count of integers that should be excluded due to constraints of type 3.
