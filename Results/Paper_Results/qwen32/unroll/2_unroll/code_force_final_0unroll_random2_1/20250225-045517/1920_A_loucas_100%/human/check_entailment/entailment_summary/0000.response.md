### Reasoning:
The provided program correctly processes each test case by categorizing the constraints into three lists: `less` for constraints of type 2 (k ≤ x), `big` for constraints of type 1 (k ≥ x), and `no` for constraints of type 3 (k ≠ x). 

The program then calculates the initial number of possible values for `k` by determining the range between the maximum value in `big` and the minimum value in `less`, inclusive. This is done using the expression `min(less) - max(big) + 1`.

If the calculated number of possible values (`num`) is less than 1, it means there are no integers `k` that can satisfy all the constraints, and the program correctly prints `0`.

If there are potential values for `k`, the program iterates through the `no` list and decrements `num` for each value in `no` that falls within the range defined by `max(big)` and `min(less)`. This ensures that integers `k` which are explicitly excluded by the constraints of type 3 are not counted.

The program correctly handles the constraints and outputs the correct number of integers `k` that satisfy all the constraints for each test case.

### Correctness: **True**
