You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints, followed by n lines where each line contains two integers a (a ∈ {1, 2, 3}) and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). Here, a = 1 means k must be greater than or equal to x, a = 2 means k must be less than or equal to x, and a = 3 means k must not be equal to x. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same. The input starts with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes lists `less`, `big`, and `no` to store the constraints of types 2, 1, and 3 respectively. It also initializes `num` to 0, which will be used to store the count of valid integers `k`.

2. **Reading Input**: For each test case, the program reads the number of constraints `innerLoop` and then reads each constraint. Depending on the type of constraint, it appends the value to the corresponding list (`less` for type 2, `big` for type 1, and `no` for type 3).

3. **Calculating Initial Range**: The program calculates the initial range of valid integers `k` by subtracting the maximum value from `big` (the smallest lower bound) from the minimum value in `less` (the largest upper bound) and adding 1. This gives the number of integers in the range `[max(big), min(less)]`.

4. **Checking for Validity**: If the calculated range `num` is less than 1, it means there are no valid integers `k` that satisfy the constraints, and the program prints 0 for that test case.

5. **Adjusting for Exclusions**: If there are valid integers in the range, the program iterates through the list `no` and decrements `num` for each integer in `no` that falls within the range `[max(big), min(less)]`. This accounts for the integers that are excluded by constraints of type 3.

6. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the adjusted count of valid integers `k` for each test case.

The logic and implementation of the program correctly handle the constraints and calculate the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. It accounts for the range defined by constraints of type 1 and 2, and correctly adjusts for the exclusions specified by constraints of type 3.

Correctness: **True**
