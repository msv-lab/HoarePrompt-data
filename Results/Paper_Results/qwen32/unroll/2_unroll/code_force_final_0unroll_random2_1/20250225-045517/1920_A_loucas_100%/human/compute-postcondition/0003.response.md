Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) indicating the number of constraints, followed by `n` lines of constraints where each constraint is defined by two integers `a` and `x`. The integer `a` specifies the type of constraint: `a = 1` means `k` must be greater than or equal to `x`, `a = 2` means `k` must be less than or equal to `x`, and `a = 3` means `k` must not be equal to `x`. The function returns "YES" if there exists an integer `k` that satisfies all the constraints for a test case, otherwise it returns "NO".**
