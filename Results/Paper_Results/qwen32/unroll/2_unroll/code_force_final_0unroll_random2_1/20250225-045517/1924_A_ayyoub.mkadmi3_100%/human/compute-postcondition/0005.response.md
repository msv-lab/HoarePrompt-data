The code snippet calculates the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k` and assigns the result to `r`. The values of `s1`, `s2`, and `alphabet` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is the same as `s`, `s2` contains characters from `s` that caused alphabet to reset, and `alphabet` is the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `r` is `len(s1) // k`.**
