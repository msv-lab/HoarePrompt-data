Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Logic for Checking Subsequences**: The function `func_1` does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in `s`. It only checks if all characters from `a` to `k`th letter appear in `s` and then resets the alphabet set. This does not ensure that all possible combinations of length `n` are checked as subsequences.

2. **Generating a Missing Subsequence**: The program attempts to generate a missing subsequence by finding the first character not in `s1` and repeating it, but this is incorrect. It does not ensure that this generated string is not a subsequence of `s`.

3. **Output Formatting**: The output should be in a specific format, with "YES" or "NO" in any case, and if "NO", a specific string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to:
- Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- Check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.
- If any string is not found, output "NO" and the string that is not a subsequence.
- If all strings are found, output "YES".

The provided code does not implement these steps correctly, hence it is incorrect.
