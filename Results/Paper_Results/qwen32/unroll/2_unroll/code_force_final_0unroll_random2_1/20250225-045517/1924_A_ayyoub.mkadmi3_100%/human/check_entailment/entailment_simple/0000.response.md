### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its logic step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1(s, k, n)` is supposed to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in `s`.
   - It initializes an alphabet set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through the string `s`. If a character `i` is in the alphabet set, it removes `i` from the set (if the set has more than one element). If the set has only one element, it adds the character to `s2` and resets the alphabet set.
   - It constructs `s1` by appending characters from `s` that are in the alphabet set.
   - It calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
   - It returns a tuple containing:
     - A boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`.
     - A substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end of `s1`.
     - The string `s2`.

3. **Output Construction:**
   - If the boolean from `func_1` is `True`, it appends 'Yes' to the output list.
   - If the boolean is `False`, it appends 'No' and constructs a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s` by finding the first character not in `s1` and repeating it `n` times.

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic of `func_1` is flawed. It does not correctly determine if all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`. It only checks if the string `s1` (which is essentially `s` filtered by the alphabet set) has a length of at least `n * k`, which is not a sufficient condition.
- The construction of the string `s2` and the logic for generating a string that is not a subsequence of `s` are also incorrect. The program does not correctly identify a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`.
- The program does not handle the requirement to find any string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s` when the answer is 'No'. The current approach of repeating the first missing character `n` times does not guarantee that this string is not a subsequence.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the logic and the construction of the output, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
