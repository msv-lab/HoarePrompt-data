You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

    #The program returns a tuple containing a boolean, a substring of `s1`, and `s2`. The boolean is `True` if the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, and `False` otherwise. The substring is the part of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1`. `s2` is the set of characters from `s` that caused the alphabet to reset.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a string `s` composed of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. It returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the length of a specific substring of `s` is at least `n * k`, that substring, and a string of characters that caused a reset condition.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

Let's go through the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appear as subsequences in the given string `s`. If not, we need to find and print one such string that does not appear as a subsequence.

### Key Points
- **Subsequence**: A string `a` is a subsequence of `b` if all characters of `a` appear in `b` in the same order but not necessarily consecutively.
- **Possible Strings**: There are `k^n` possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- **Output**: Print "YES" if all possible strings appear as subsequences; otherwise, print "NO" followed by a string that does not appear as a subsequence.

### Program Analysis

Let's carefully examine the provided program to see if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Main Loop
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` followed by the string `s`.
- It calls `func_1(s, k, n)` to check if all possible strings of length `n` can be found as subsequences in `s`.

#### Function `func_1(s, k, n)`
- It initializes an alphabet set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- It iterates over each character in `s` and updates the alphabet set and strings `s1` and `s2`.
- It checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k` and returns a tuple containing this check result, a substring of `s1`, and `s2`.

#### Output Generation
- If `func_1` returns `True`, the program appends "YES" to the output list.
- If `func_1` returns `False`, the program appends "NO" and attempts to find a string of length `n` that does not appear as a subsequence.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The function does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` appear as subsequences in `s`.
   - The logic for constructing `s1` and `s2` and the alphabet set does not ensure that all possible subsequences are considered.

2. **Finding a Non-Subsequence String**:
   - The logic to find a string that does not appear as a subsequence is incorrect. It simply checks for the first missing character and constructs a string, which does not guarantee that this string will not be a subsequence.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where `n` is large or `k` is small, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in the logic of `func_1` and the method to find a non-subsequence string, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
