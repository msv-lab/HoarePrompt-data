### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to determine whether all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the given string `s`. If not, it should provide an example of a string that does not occur as a subsequence.

Let's analyze the given program and its components:

1. **Main Loop**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with `s`, `k`, and `n` as arguments.
   - Based on the return value of `func_1`, it appends either 'YES' or 'NO' to the `OUT` list. If 'NO' is appended, it also appends a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence of `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes `s1` and `s2` as empty strings.
   - It creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through each character in `s`. If the character is in `alphabet`, it removes the character from `alphabet`. If `alphabet` becomes empty, it resets `alphabet` and appends the character to `s2`. It also appends the character to `s1`.
   - Finally, it returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and `s2`.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Logic of `func_1`**:
   - The current logic in `func_1` does not correctly determine if all possible strings of length `n` occur as a subsequence in `s`. The function's logic is flawed as it does not check for subsequences but rather a specific pattern of characters.
   - The function's return value does not accurately reflect the requirement to check for all possible subsequences of length `n`.

2. **Generating the Missing String**:
   - The logic to generate a string that does not occur as a subsequence is incorrect. The current approach does not guarantee that the generated string is not a subsequence.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues in the logic of `func_1` and the way the missing string is generated, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **False**
