Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and two integers `k` and `n`. It returns a tuple containing a boolean, a substring of `s`, and a set of characters. The boolean is `True` if the length of the substring `s1` (which is the part of `s` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s`) is greater than or equal to `n * k`, and `False` otherwise. The set of characters is the set of characters from `s` that caused the alphabet to reset.**
