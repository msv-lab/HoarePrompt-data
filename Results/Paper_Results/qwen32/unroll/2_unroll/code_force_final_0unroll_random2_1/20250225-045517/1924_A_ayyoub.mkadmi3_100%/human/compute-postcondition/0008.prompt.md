You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000. Additionally, t test cases are provided, with the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 10^6.
def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
        
    #State: s1 is the same as s, s2 contains characters from s that caused alphabet to reset, and alphabet is the set of the first k lowercase English alphabets.
    r = len(s1) // k
    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #The program returns a tuple containing a boolean, a substring of `s1`, and `s2`. The boolean is `True` if the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, and `False` otherwise. The substring is the part of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1`. `s2` is the set of characters from `s` that caused the alphabet to reset.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `s` of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and two integers `k` and `n`. It returns a tuple containing a boolean, a substring of `s`, and a set of characters. The boolean is `True` if the length of the substring `s1` (which is the part of `s` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s`) is greater than or equal to `n * k`, and `False` otherwise. The set of characters is the set of characters from `s` that caused the alphabet to reset.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a tuple containing a boolean, a substring of `s1`, and `s2`. The boolean is `True` if the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, and `False` otherwise. The substring is the part of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1`. `s2` is the set of characters from `s` that caused the alphabet to reset.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
