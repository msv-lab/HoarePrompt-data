To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and the function `func_1`. However, the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code snippet, so we will assume that `func_1` processes the inputs (`n`, `m`, `k`, `friendships`) and returns a result.

Given the loop:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
    result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
    print(result)
```
The loop runs `t` times. For each iteration:
1. It reads new values for `n`, `m`, and `k`.
2. It reads `m` lines of friendships data.
3. It calls `func_1` with these values and prints the result.

Since the loop runs `t` times, after all iterations, the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` will hold the values from the last iteration. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is the loop counter and does not get modified inside the loop.

The output state will reflect the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` from the last iteration of the loop. The initial state of other variables not affected by the loop (if any) remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` hold the values from the last iteration of the loop, and `t` remains unchanged.**
