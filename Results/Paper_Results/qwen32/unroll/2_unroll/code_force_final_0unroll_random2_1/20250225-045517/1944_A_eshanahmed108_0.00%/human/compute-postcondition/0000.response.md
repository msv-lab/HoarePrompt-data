In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the variable `_` and the range function, which takes the result of `int(input())` as its argument. The loop will execute if the input value is greater than 0. The variables `n`, `k`, and `t` are mentioned in the state description but are not directly part of the loop head. Therefore, we can only adjust the input value to ensure the loop executes.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

- The loop will execute `int(input())` times.
- For the loop to execute at least once, the input value must be greater than 0.
- The variables `n`, `k`, and `t` are part of the state before the loop but do not directly affect the loop's execution in terms of the loop head.

Since the loop head only involves the result of `int(input())`, we need to ensure that this value is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The variables `n`, `k`, and `t` remain as they are described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` * (`n` - 1) / 2. There are `t` test cases, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^3. The input value for the loop must be greater than 0.**
