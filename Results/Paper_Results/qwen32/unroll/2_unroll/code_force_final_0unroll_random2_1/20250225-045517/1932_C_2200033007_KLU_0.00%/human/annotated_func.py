#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, m is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):

    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':

    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the list `ans` in reversed order, where `ans` contains the cumulative product of elements of `b` in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes four parameters: an integer `n`, a positive integer `m`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'. It constructs a new list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the characters in `s` ('L' for left end, 'R' for right end). It then calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` in reverse order and returns this list.
