Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Product Remainders**:
   - The program calculates the product of elements in the `b` list, which contains elements in the order they are removed, not the product of the current state of the array `a` at each step.
   - The problem requires the product of all remaining elements of `a` to be calculated and taken modulo `m` before each command is processed.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Product Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the product in reverse order and then reverses the result list. This does not match the requirement of calculating the product of the current state of the array `a` at each command step.
   - The product should be calculated from the current state of the array `a` before each element is removed, not from the list of removed elements.

To fix the program, you should maintain the product of the current state of the array `a` and update it as elements are removed according to the commands. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    # Calculate the initial product of all elements modulo m
    product = 1
    for num in a:
        product = (product * num) % m
    
    ans = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    
    for command in s:
        # Append the current product to the answer list
        ans.append(product)
        # Update the product based on the command
        if command == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a[left], m-2, m)) % m  # Remove the leftmost element
            left += 1
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a[right], m-2, m)) % m  # Remove the rightmost element
            right -= 1
    
    return ans
```

In this corrected version:
- The initial product of all elements in `a` is calculated and taken modulo `m`.
- For each command, the product is updated by removing the element that is about to be deleted. This is done using modular multiplicative inverse to effectively divide the product by the element being removed.
- The product is then taken modulo `m` again to ensure it remains within the required range.
- The updated product is appended to the answer list before the element is removed from the array `a`.
