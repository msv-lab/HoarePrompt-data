The function reads input values representing a tree with exactly two leaves and a starting node. It determines whether a player named Ron or Hermione wins a game based on the minimum number of moves required to reach either leaf from the starting node. The game rules state that if the minimum number of moves to either leaf is odd, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins. The function prints the name of the winning player.
