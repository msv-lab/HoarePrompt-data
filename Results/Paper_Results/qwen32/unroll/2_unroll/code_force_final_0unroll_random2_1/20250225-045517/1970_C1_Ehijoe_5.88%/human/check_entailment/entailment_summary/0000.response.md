### Reasoning:

The problem describes a game played on a tree with exactly two leaves, which can be visualized as a linear structure (array-like). The game involves moving a stone from an initial node to either leaf, with players taking turns. The player who cannot make a move loses. The key to determining the winner is the parity (odd or even) of the minimum number of moves required to reach either leaf from the starting node.

Here’s a breakdown of the program’s logic:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of nodes `n`, the number of rounds `t` (which is always 1), the edges of the tree, and the starting node for the game.
2. **Tree Representation**: The tree is represented as a deque, which is a double-ended queue. The program constructs this deque by appending nodes based on the edges provided. This representation is valid for a tree with exactly two leaves, as it can be linearized.
3. **Finding Minimum Moves**: The program calculates the index of the starting node within the deque. It then computes the minimum number of moves required to reach either end of the deque (representing the two leaves). This is done by comparing the index of the starting node with the total number of nodes.
4. **Winning Condition**: The program checks the parity of the minimum number of moves. If either of the two possible moves (to either end) is odd, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.

The logic correctly identifies the winning player based on the parity of the minimum number of moves. The program handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement correctly.
