The code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `num`. The initial state includes `t` as an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` as an integer between 1 and 10^5, and `a` as a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9. The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

After executing the code `num = int(input())`, the value of `num` is set to the integer value provided by the input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and `num` is the integer value provided by the input.**
