t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of x distinct integers. For each tuple, 4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), and y = 0. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The list of x distinct integers represents the vertices Bessie has chosen and contains integers in the range from 1 to n.
