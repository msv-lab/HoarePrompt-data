Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. It then processes these inputs to derive a new binary string `s` and an integer `t`, which it prints. The string `s` is constructed based on specific conditions comparing the two input binary strings, and `t` is determined based on the prefix matching of the derived string `s` with the first input binary string.**
