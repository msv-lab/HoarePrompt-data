The code reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `T`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `MOD` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet. 

Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the input, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^9 <= a_i <= 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007.**
