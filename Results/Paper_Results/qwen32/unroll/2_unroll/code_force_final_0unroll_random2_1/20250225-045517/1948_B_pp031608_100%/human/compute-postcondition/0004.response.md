Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the list can be modified such that each element is greater than or equal to the previous one by potentially replacing each element with the first digit of the previous element if the current element is smaller. It prints "YES" if such a modification is possible for the entire list, otherwise "NO".**
