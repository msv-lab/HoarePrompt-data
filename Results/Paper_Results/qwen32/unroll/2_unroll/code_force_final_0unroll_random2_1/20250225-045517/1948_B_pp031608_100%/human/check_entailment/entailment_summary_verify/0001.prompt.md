You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the list can be modified such that each element is greater than or equal to the previous one by potentially replacing each element with the first digit of the previous element if the current element is smaller. It prints "YES" if such a modification is possible for the entire list, otherwise "NO".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness according to the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: We need to determine if it is possible to sort an array in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting any element that is at least 10 into its constituent digits.
2. **Constraints**:
   - The array can have up to 50 elements.
   - Each element is an integer between 0 and 99.
   - We can perform the operation any number of times (including zero).

### Program Analysis:
The program follows these steps:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It initializes `ans` to `True`, assuming that the array can be sorted.
   - It iterates over the array from the end to the beginning (from index `m-1` to `1`).
   - If an element `arr[i]` is less than the previous element `arr[i-1]`, it checks if splitting `arr[i-1]` into its digits and placing `arr[i]` at the end results in a sorted subarray.
   - If the subarray is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If `arr[i-1]` is split, it updates `arr[i-1]` to the first digit of the split number.

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, it prints "YES" if `ans` is `True` and "NO" otherwise.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Logic**: The program incorrectly assumes that if splitting `arr[i-1]` and placing `arr[i]` at the end results in a sorted subarray, the entire array can be sorted. This is not necessarily true.
- **Incomplete Check**: The program only checks the immediate subarray after a split and does not ensure that the rest of the array remains sorted.
- **Handling of Multiple Splits**: The program does not handle multiple splits correctly. It only considers the immediate effect of a single split.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly determine if the entire array can be sorted by the described operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
