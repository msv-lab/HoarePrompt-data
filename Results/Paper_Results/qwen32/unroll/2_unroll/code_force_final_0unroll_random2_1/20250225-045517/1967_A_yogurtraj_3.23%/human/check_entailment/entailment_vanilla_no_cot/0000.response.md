Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly compute the maximum score. The logic for distributing the `k` coins to maximize the number of valid permutations is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the distribution of the remaining coins after the initial loop and does not account for the optimal way to distribute the coins to achieve the highest possible score.

Here are a few issues in the program:
1. The program sorts the list `a` which is not necessary for the problem and might lead to incorrect results.
2. The logic for distributing the remaining coins after the loop is incorrect. It does not consider the optimal distribution to maximize the number of valid permutations.
3. The formula for calculating the final score is incorrect. It does not correctly account for the number of valid permutations that can be formed.

A correct approach would involve using a binary search or a greedy strategy to determine the maximum possible value `r` such that all cards can be rearranged into permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]` with the given number of coins. The final score can then be calculated based on this value `r`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        def can_form_permutations(r):
            needed = 0
            for i in range(n):
                needed += max(0, r - a[i])
            return needed <= k
        
        lo, hi = 0, max(a) + k
        while lo < hi:
            mid = (lo + hi + 1) // 2
            if can_form_permutations(mid):
                lo = mid
            else:
                hi = mid - 1
        
        r = lo
        needed = 0
        extra = k
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] < r:
                needed += r - a[i]
                extra -= r - a[i]
        
        score = (r - 1) * n + 1
        score += min(extra, n - 1)
        print(score)

func()
```

This corrected program uses a binary search to find the maximum `r` and then calculates the score based on the number of extra coins available after forming the permutations.
