Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The game revolves around the number of facing-up coins ('U'). The key point for determining the winner is the parity (odd or even) of the number of 'U's. The player who faces a situation with an odd number of 'U's can always make a move that leaves an even number of 'U's for the opponent, and vice versa. Since the game ends when there are no 'U's left, the player who starts with an odd number of 'U's will always win if both play optimally.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by counting the number of 'U's in the string representing the coins. It then checks the parity of this count:
- If the number of 'U's is odd, it returns 'YES', indicating that Alice (the first player) will win.
- If the number of 'U's is even, it returns 'NO', indicating that Bob (the second player) will win.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem analysis. It checks the parity of the number of facing-up coins and determines the winner based on it. Therefore, the program is correct.
