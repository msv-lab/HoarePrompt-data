In the given task, the for loop iterates over the number of test cases. The loop head only contains the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. To ensure the loop executes, we need to ensure that the input provided to the program is such that `int(input())` is greater than 0. This value represents the number of test cases.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains `_` and `int(input())`. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The actual number of iterations is determined by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0. This value represents the number of test cases.

3. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop executes, the input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that the number of test cases is greater than 0.

State: **The number of test cases (input to `int(input())`) must be greater than 0**.
