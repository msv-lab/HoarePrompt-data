Functionality: **The function accepts three integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, representing the number of elements in the array, the limit on the number of elements Alice can remove, and the limit on the number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, respectively. Additionally, it accepts an array of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The function returns the maximum possible sum of the array after Alice removes up to `k` elements and Bob multiplies up to `x` elements by -1.**
