You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of three integers n, k, and x (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n) representing the number of elements in the array, the limit on the number of elements Alice can remove, and the limit on the number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, respectively. The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000) representing the elements of the array. The total number of elements across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        a.reverse()
        
        sum1 = sum(a)
        
        ans = []
        
        for i in range(k + 1):
            if i == 0:
                sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])
                ans.append(sums)
            elif i + x - 1 < n:
                sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
                ans.append(sums)
            else:
                sums = sums + a[i - 1]
                ans.append(sums)
        
        print(max(ans))
        
    #State: maximum_sum
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, representing the number of elements in the array, the limit on the number of elements Alice can remove, and the limit on the number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, respectively. Additionally, it accepts an array of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The function returns the maximum possible sum of the array after Alice removes up to `k` elements and Bob multiplies up to `x` elements by -1.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
