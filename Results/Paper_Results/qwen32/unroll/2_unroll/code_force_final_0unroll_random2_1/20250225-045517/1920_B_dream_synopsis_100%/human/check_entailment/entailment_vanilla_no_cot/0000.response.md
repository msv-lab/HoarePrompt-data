Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Alice's Strategy**: Alice should remove the smallest `k` elements to maximize the sum of the remaining elements. The current code does not correctly implement this strategy. It seems to be trying to remove elements and then adjust the sum based on Bob's actions, but it does not correctly handle the removal of elements.

2. **Bob's Strategy**: After Alice removes elements, Bob should flip the signs of the smallest `x` elements to minimize the sum. The current code does not correctly implement this strategy either. It incorrectly calculates the sum after Alice's removal and then tries to adjust it based on Bob's actions without correctly identifying the smallest elements to flip.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Alice removes at most k elements
        a.sort()
        remaining = a[k:]
        
        # Bob flips at most x elements
        remaining.sort()
        flips = min(x, len(remaining))
        
        # Flip the smallest `flips` elements
        for i in range(flips):
            remaining[i] = -remaining[i]
        
        # Calculate the final sum
        print(sum(remaining))

func()
```

This corrected version first sorts the array and removes the smallest `k` elements. Then, it sorts the remaining elements and flips the smallest `x` of them. Finally, it calculates and prints the sum of the modified array.
