The provided code snippet initializes an empty list `s`. This does not affect the existing list `sChar` in any way. Therefore, `sChar` remains as it was in the initial state.

Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings, where each string `s` in `sChar` is a binary string (consisting of only '0's and '1's) with length 2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5, and the total length of all strings in `sChar` does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `s` is an empty list.**
