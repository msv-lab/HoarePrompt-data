You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . Output a 2n \times 2n checkerboard made of 2
\times 2 squares alternating '\texttt{#} ' and '\texttt{.} ', with the top-
left cell being '\texttt{#} '.

The picture above shows the answers for n=1,2,3,4 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 20 ) — the number of test
cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20
) — it means you need to output a checkerboard of side length 2n .

Output

For each test case, output 2n lines, each containing 2n characters without
spaces — the checkerboard, as described in the statement. Do not output empty
lines between test cases.

- Program:
def func():
    casos = int(input())
    for c in range(0, casos):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('##')
            print('##')
        elif n == 2:
            print('##..')
            print('##..')
            print('..##')
            print('..##')
        elif n == 3:
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
            print('..##..')
            print('..##..')
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
        elif n == 4:
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
        else:
            print('No esta en el rango')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= `t` <= 20. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 20. It then prints a pattern of `n` by `n` blocks separated by dots, with each block being 2x2 characters. If `n` is not within the range 1 to 4, it prints 'No esta en el rango'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The given program is designed to handle a specific set of inputs for the problem where n can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. The program checks the value of n and prints the corresponding 2n x 2n checkerboard pattern. However, the problem statement specifies that n can be up to 20, which means the program does not handle all possible valid inputs. 

For n values greater than 4, the program outputs an error message "No esta en el rango" (which means "Not in the range" in Spanish), instead of printing the appropriate checkerboard pattern. This makes the program incorrect for the full range of valid inputs as per the problem description.

Therefore, the program is not correct for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **False**
