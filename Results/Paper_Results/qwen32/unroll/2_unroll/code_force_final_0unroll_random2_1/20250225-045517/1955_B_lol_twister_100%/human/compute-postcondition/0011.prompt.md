You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, c and d are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, and l is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 25 * 10^4.
def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):
        for h in range(0, n):
            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9; `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`; `li` is a list containing n^2 integers, where each integer is calculated as a + k * c + d * h for k in range(0, n) and h in range(0, n).
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if (l == li) :
        return 'yes'
        #The program returns 'yes'
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a sorted list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a sorted list containing n^2 integers, where each integer is calculated as a + k * c + d * h for k in range(0, n) and h in range(0, n). The list `l` is not equal to the list `li`.
    return 'no'
    #The program returns 'no'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer representing the size of a matrix), `c` and `d` (integers with specific constraints), and `l` (a list of `n^2` integers representing the elements of the matrix). Based on these inputs, the function returns 'yes' if a certain condition is met, otherwise it returns 'no'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'yes'

Case_2: The program returns 'no'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
