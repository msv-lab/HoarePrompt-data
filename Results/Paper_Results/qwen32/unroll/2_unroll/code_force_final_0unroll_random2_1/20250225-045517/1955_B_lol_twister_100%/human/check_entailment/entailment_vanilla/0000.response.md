Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to determine if a given list of integers can be rearranged to form a specific type of matrix (progressive square). The matrix is constructed based on the starting element `a_{1,1}`, and the values `c` and `d` which dictate the rules of how subsequent elements are generated. Specifically, for an `n x n` matrix, the element at position `(i, j)` is given by `a_{1,1} + (i-1) * c + (j-1) * d`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `c`, and `d`.
   - It then reads the list of integers `l` of size `n^2`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It calculates the minimum value `a` from the list `l`, which is assumed to be `a_{1,1}`.
   - It generates a new list `li` containing the expected values of the progressive square.
     - For each position `(k, h)` in the matrix, it calculates the value as `a + k * c + h * d`.
   - It sorts both `li` and the input list `l`.
   - It compares the sorted lists. If they are equal, it returns 'yes', indicating that the list can be rearranged to form the progressive square. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

### Correctness Check:
1. **Assumption of `a_{1,1}`**:
   - The program assumes that the smallest element in the list `l` is `a_{1,1}`. This is correct because in the progressive square, `a_{1,1}` is the smallest possible value.

2. **Generating the Progressive Square**:
   - The program correctly generates the expected values for the progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + h * d`.

3. **Sorting and Comparison**:
   - By sorting both the generated list and the input list, the program ensures that it is comparing the same set of elements, regardless of their original order.
   - If the sorted lists are equal, the input list can be rearranged to form the progressive square.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given list can be rearranged to form the progressive square as defined by the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
