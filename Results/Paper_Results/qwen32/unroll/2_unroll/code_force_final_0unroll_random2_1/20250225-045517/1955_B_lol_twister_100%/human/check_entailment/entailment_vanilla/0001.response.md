### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine if a given list of integers can be rearranged to form a specific type of matrix (progressive square) based on given parameters \(n\), \(c\), and \(d\).

The function `func_1` in the provided code is intended to check if the list `l` can be rearranged to match the elements of a progressive square of size \(n \times n\) constructed using the rules provided.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code's logic:

1. **Finding the Minimum Value (`a`)**: The code identifies the minimum value in the list `l` as `a`. This is a reasonable assumption since the problem states that the elements of the progressive square can be constructed based on a starting value `a_{1,1}`.

2. **Generating the Progressive Square**: The code then generates a list `li` that represents the elements of the progressive square using the formula:
   \[
   a + k \cdot c + d \cdot h
   \]
   where \(k\) and \(h\) range from 0 to \(n-1\). This correctly reflects the rules for constructing the progressive square.

3. **Sorting and Comparing**: Both the generated list `li` and the input list `l` are sorted. The code then checks if the sorted versions of `li` and `l` are equal. If they are, it means that the elements in `l` can be rearranged to form the progressive square, and the function returns "YES". Otherwise, it returns "NO".

### Evaluation:

The code correctly implements the logic to determine if the given list `l` can be rearranged to form the progressive square based on the parameters \(n\), \(c\), and \(d\). It efficiently constructs the expected elements of the progressive square and checks if the input list matches these elements when both are sorted.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided logic.

**Correctness:** **True**
