You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine if a given list of integers can be rearranged to form a specific type of matrix (progressive square) based on given parameters \(n\), \(c\), and \(d\).

The function `func_1` in the provided code is intended to check if the list `l` can be rearranged to match the elements of a progressive square of size \(n \times n\) constructed using the rules provided.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code's logic:

1. **Finding the Minimum Value (`a`)**: The code identifies the minimum value in the list `l` as `a`. This is a reasonable assumption since the problem states that the elements of the progressive square can be constructed based on a starting value `a_{1,1}`.

2. **Generating the Progressive Square**: The code then generates a list `li` that represents the elements of the progressive square using the formula:
   \[
   a + k \cdot c + d \cdot h
   \]
   where \(k\) and \(h\) range from 0 to \(n-1\). This correctly reflects the rules for constructing the progressive square.

3. **Sorting and Comparing**: Both the generated list `li` and the input list `l` are sorted. The code then checks if the sorted versions of `li` and `l` are equal. If they are, it means that the elements in `l` can be rearranged to form the progressive square, and the function returns "YES". Otherwise, it returns "NO".

### Evaluation:

The code correctly implements the logic to determine if the given list `l` can be rearranged to form the progressive square based on the parameters \(n\), \(c\), and \(d\). It efficiently constructs the expected elements of the progressive square and checks if the input list matches these elements when both are sorted.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided logic.
