Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to find the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings. The cost of a cyclic shift of a substring is the length of that substring. The goal is to minimize the total cost.

### Key Observations

1. **Binary String**: The string consists only of `0`s and `1`s.
2. **Sorted Order**: A sorted binary string will have all `0`s followed by all `1`s.
3. **Cost Calculation**: The cost is minimized by understanding how many `1`s are before the first `0` and how many `0`s are after the last `1`. Each `1` before a `0` requires a shift to bring it after the `0`s, and each `0` after a `1` requires a shift to bring it before the `1`s.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)
```

#### Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers.

2. **Counting Zeroes**:
   - `zeroes` is the total number of `0`s in the string.

3. **Counters and Cost Calculation**:
   - `cnt` is a list to keep track of the count of `0`s and `1`s encountered so far.
   - `ans` is initialized to `0` and will store the total cost.
   - The program iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`:
     - It increments the respective count in `cnt`.
     - If `c` is `0`:
       - It adds `1` to `ans` if there is at least one `1` encountered so far (`cnt[1] > 0`). This is because each `1` before a `0` needs to be shifted.
     - If `c` is `1`:
       - It adds the number of remaining `0`s (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans`. This is because each `0` after a `1` needs to be shifted.

### Correctness Verification

The logic of the program seems to be based on the idea of counting the cost of shifting `1`s that appear before `0`s and `0`s that appear after `1`s. However, this approach does not correctly account for the cost of cyclic shifts. The cost calculation in the program does not align with the actual cost of performing cyclic shifts on substrings.

- The program does not actually perform any cyclic shifts; it only calculates a cost based on the counts of `0`s and `1`s.
- The cost calculation does not consider the actual length of the substrings being shifted, which is crucial for determining the correct cost.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
