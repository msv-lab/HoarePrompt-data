You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, s is a binary string of length between 2 and 2 * 10^5, inclusive, consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. The sum of the lengths of all strings s across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        
        cnt = [0, 0]
        
        ans = 0
        
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The output state consists of `t` integers, each representing the result of the corresponding test case after processing the binary string `s` according to the described logic.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts no direct parameters. Instead, it processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000. For each test case, it receives a binary string `s` of length between 2 and 200,000, consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. The sum of the lengths of all strings `s` across all test cases does not exceed 200,000. The function returns the result for each test case based on the processing of the binary string `s`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
