### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to compute the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Let's analyze the correctness of the program based on the provided problem description and the annotated states.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers (0s and 1s).

2. **Counting Zeroes**:
   - It counts the total number of zeroes in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `zeroes`.

3. **Tracking Counts**:
   - It initializes a list `cnt` to keep track of the counts of 0s and 1s encountered so far as it iterates through the string.

4. **Cost Calculation**:
   - It initializes a variable `ans` to accumulate the total cost.
   - For each character `c` in the string:
     - It increments the count of the current character in `cnt`.
     - If the character is 0, it adds 1 to `ans` if there have been any 1s encountered so far (i.e., `cnt[1] > 0`). This is because each 0 encountered after at least one 1 contributes to the cost of shifting the 1s to the right.
     - If the character is 1, it adds the number of remaining zeroes (i.e., `zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans`. This is because each 1 encountered needs to be shifted past all the remaining zeroes to the right.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing each string, it prints the accumulated cost `ans`.

### Evaluation:
- The logic seems to correctly handle the cost calculation based on the problem's requirements. It ensures that the cost is computed by considering the relative positions of 0s and 1s in the string.
- The program efficiently processes each test case in linear time relative to the length of the string, which is suitable given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly compute the minimum total cost to sort the binary strings as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
