### Reasoning:

The task is to determine the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring is equal to the length of that substring.

Let's analyze the provided program to see if it correctly implements the solution:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `s` is a binary string converted to a list of integers (0s and 1s).
   - `zeroes` counts the total number of '0's in the string.
   - `cnt` is a list initialized to `[0, 0]` to keep track of the count of '0's and '1's encountered so far.
   - `ans` is initialized to `0` to accumulate the total cost.

2. **Processing Each Character**:
   - For each character `c` in the string `s`:
     - Increment the count of the current character (`cnt[c]`).
     - If the character is '0':
       - Add `1` to `ans` if there are any '1's encountered before (`cnt[1] > 0`).
     - If the character is '1':
       - Add the number of remaining '0's to `ans` (`zeroes - cnt[0]`).

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the accumulated cost `ans` is printed.

### Explanation of the Logic:

The logic of the program is based on the observation that:
- To sort a binary string, all '0's should appear before all '1's.
- When encountering a '1', the cost to move all previously seen '1's to the right of this '1' is the number of remaining '0's.
- When encountering a '0', the cost to move this '0' past all previously seen '1's is `1` if there are any '1's encountered before.

This approach ensures that the program calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string by considering the cost of each character's position relative to previously encountered characters.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum total cost to sort a binary string using the described operations. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Response:
Reasoning: The program correctly calculates the minimum total cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts by considering the cost of each character's position relative to previously encountered characters.
Correctness: **True**
