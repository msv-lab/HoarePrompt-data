To determine the state adjustments needed for the `for` loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop is defined as:

```python
for _ in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0 because `range(n)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

Given the state before the loop starts:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- For each of the `t` test cases, `s` is a binary string of length between 2 and 2 * 10^5, inclusive.
- `n` is an input integer.

The only variable that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is `n`. Specifically, `n` must be greater than 0.

Thus, the state should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each of the `t` test cases, `s` is a binary string of length between 2 and 2 * 10^5, inclusive, and `n` must be greater than 0**.
