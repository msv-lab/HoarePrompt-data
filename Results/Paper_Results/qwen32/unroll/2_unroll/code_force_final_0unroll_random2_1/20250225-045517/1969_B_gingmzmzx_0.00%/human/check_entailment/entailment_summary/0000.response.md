To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the provided Python code and see if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
The task is to find the minimum cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s followed by all 1s) by performing cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `k` is `k`.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each binary string separately. For each binary string, it calculates the minimum cost to sort the string using a specific logic.

Here's the breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Counting Zeroes and Ones**: It counts the total number of zeroes in the string.
2. **Tracking Counts of Zeroes and Ones**: It maintains a running count of zeroes and ones encountered so far.
3. **Calculating Cost**:
   - If the current character is a 0 and there have been ones encountered before it, it adds 1 to the cost. This is because a 0 should ideally come before any 1, and if a 1 has already appeared, moving this 0 to the left of the first 1 (which might require a cyclic shift) incurs a cost of 1.
   - If the current character is a 1, it adds the number of remaining zeroes to the cost. This is because each remaining 0 should ideally come before this 1, and moving each of these 0s to the left of this 1 (which might require a cyclic shift) incurs a cost of 1 per 0.

### Correctness:
The provided logic seems to be based on the idea of counting inversions in the binary string, where an inversion is a pair of characters where a 1 appears before a 0. The cost calculation is effectively counting the number of such inversions, which aligns with the problem's requirement to sort the string with the minimum cost of cyclic shifts.

However, the provided program does not explicitly perform cyclic shifts or calculate the cost of those shifts in the traditional sense. Instead, it cleverly counts the number of inversions, which is equivalent to the minimum cost in this specific problem context.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to calculate the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using the described method.

**Correctness: True**
