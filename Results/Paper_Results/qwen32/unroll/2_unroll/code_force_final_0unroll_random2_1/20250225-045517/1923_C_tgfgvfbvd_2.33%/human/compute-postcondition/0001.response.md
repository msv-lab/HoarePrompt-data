The provided code processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of integers and then processes a series of queries. Each query asks whether the sum of a subarray is at least twice the length of that subarray. The code maintains a prefix sum array to efficiently compute the sum of any subarray.

After all the test cases and queries have been processed, the state of the variables that are not affected by the loop head and body (i.e., `t`, the number of test cases) remains unchanged. The variables `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, and `s` are local to the loop and do not retain their values after the loop completes.

Therefore, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.**
