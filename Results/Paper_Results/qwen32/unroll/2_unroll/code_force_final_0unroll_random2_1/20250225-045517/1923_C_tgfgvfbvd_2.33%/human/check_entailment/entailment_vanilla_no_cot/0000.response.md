Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether a subarray is "good" according to the problem definition. The main issue lies in the logic used to check the conditions for a subarray to be considered good. Specifically, the condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` is not sufficient to ensure that there exists an integer array `b` that meets all the required conditions.

To be more precise, the condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` only checks that the sum of the subarray is at least twice the number of elements in the subarray, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the existence of an array `b` such that `a_i != b_i` and `b_i > 0` for all `i`.

A correct approach would involve checking if it is possible to construct such an array `b` by ensuring that for each element in the subarray, we can find a corresponding `b_i` that is different from `a_i` and positive. This can be done by checking if the sum of the subarray is greater than the sum of the subarray elements minus the number of elements (since each element in `b` must be at least 1 and different from the corresponding element in `a`).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = []
        c = 0
        for x in l:
            c += x
            p.append(c)
        for _ in range(m):
            (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
            s = p[b - 1]
            if a - 2 >= 0:
                s -= p[a - 2]
            # Check if the sum of the subarray is greater than the sum of the subarray elements minus the number of elements
            if s > (b - a + 1):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

However, the above logic still might not be sufficient in all edge cases. A more detailed check is required to ensure that each element in `b` can be chosen to be different from `a_i` and positive. The corrected logic should consider the possibility of adjusting each element in the subarray to meet the conditions, which involves a more complex check than simply comparing sums.
