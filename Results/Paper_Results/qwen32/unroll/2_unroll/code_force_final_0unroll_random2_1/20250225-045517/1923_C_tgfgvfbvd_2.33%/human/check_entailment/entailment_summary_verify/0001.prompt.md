You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = []
        c = 0
        for x in l:
            c += x
            p.append(c)
        for _ in range(m):
            (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
            s = p[b - 1]
            if a - 2 >= 0:
                s -= p[a - 2]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a list of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines if the sum of a specified sub-list is at least twice the length of that sub-list, printing 'YES' if true and 'NO' otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:

The task is to determine if a given subarray `c[l_i:r_i+1]` of an array `c` is "good." A subarray is considered "good" if there exists an integer array `b` of the same length such that:

1. The sum of elements in `b` equals the sum of elements in the subarray.
2. Each element in `b` is strictly greater than 0.
3. No element in `b` is equal to the corresponding element in the subarray.

### Key Observations:

- For a subarray to be "good," its sum must be at least twice its length. This is because if the sum is less than twice the length, it's impossible to construct an array `b` where each element is positive and different from the corresponding element in the subarray.
- The program uses prefix sums to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It reads the array `c` of length `n`.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix sums of the array `c` and stores them in the list `p`.
   - The prefix sum `p[i]` represents the sum of elements from `c[0]` to `c[i]`.

3. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `a` and `b` (1-based).
   - It calculates the sum of the subarray `c[a-1:b]` using the prefix sums.
   - If the length of the subarray is more than 1 and the sum is at least twice the length of the subarray, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness:

- The program correctly calculates the sum of any subarray using prefix sums.
- The condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` is used to determine if the subarray can be "good." This condition is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a valid array `b` as per the problem's constraints.
- The program handles the constraints efficiently, with a time complexity of O(n + q) per test case, which is suitable given the problem limits.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given problem description.
