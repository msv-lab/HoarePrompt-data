Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100. The grid size `n` and the grid itself, which consists of `n` lines each containing `n` characters that are either '0' or '1', are still to be inputted. It is guaranteed that the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square composed of '1's, and the size of the shape (k) is greater than 1.**

In simple terms: The variable `t` has been assigned the number of test cases, but the grid size `n` and the grid itself have not been inputted yet. The conditions about the grid still apply.
