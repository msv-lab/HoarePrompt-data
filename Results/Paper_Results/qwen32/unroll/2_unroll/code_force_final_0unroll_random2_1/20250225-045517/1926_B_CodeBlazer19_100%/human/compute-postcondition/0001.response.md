The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The state of `t` is given as an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100. Therefore, no adjustment to `t` is necessary to ensure the loop executes since it is already guaranteed to be within the valid range.

However, the state of `i` is not explicitly mentioned before the loop starts, so we need to ensure that `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts, as this is the typical starting point for a `for` loop in Python.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is 0**
