After executing the loop, the `balance` variable will be 0 because the string `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, meaning every opening parenthesis '(' has a corresponding closing parenthesis ')'. The `details` list will contain tuples for each character in the string `s`, where each tuple consists of the current `balance` after processing that character, the negative of the index of the character, and the character itself.

Since the `balance` starts at 0 and the string is balanced, it will return to 0 after processing all characters. The `details` list will be populated with entries reflecting the state of the `balance` and the index (negated) at each step.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `balance` is 0; `details` is a list of tuples (balance, -i, char) for each character in the string `s`.**
