### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to compute a "balanced shuffle" of a given balanced parentheses sequence.
   - The shuffle is determined by sorting each parenthesis based on the balance of the prefix up to that parenthesis and, in case of a tie, by the position of the parenthesis in reverse order.

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - We start by initializing `balance` to 0.
   - We iterate over each character in the input string `s`:
     - If the character is `'('`, we increase the `balance` by 1.
     - If the character is `')'`, we decrease the `balance` by 1.
     - We store a tuple `(balance, -i, char)` for each character, where `i` is the position (index) of the character in the string. The `-i` ensures that in case of ties in balance, characters with higher positions (lower `-i` values) come first.
   - We then sort the list of tuples based on the balance and position criteria.
   - Finally, we construct the result string by extracting the characters from the sorted list of tuples and print it.

3. **Validation Against the Example**:
   - For the input `(()(()))`:
     - The balance and position details list would be:
       ```
       Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
       ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
       Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
       Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
       ```
     - The sorted order based on the balance and position would be:
       ```
       Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
       ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
       Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
       Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
       ```
     - The resulting string from the sorted list is `()(()())`, which matches the expected output.

4. **Generalization**:
   - The algorithm correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.
   - It handles the sorting criteria (balance first, position in reverse order second) and constructs the final string accurately.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the required balanced shuffle operation for a balanced parentheses sequence.

**Correctness: True**
