The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a tree represented by its number of vertices `n`, the number of edges to be removed `k`, and its adjacency list `adj`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum possible size of the smallest connected component in the tree after removing exactly `k` edges.
