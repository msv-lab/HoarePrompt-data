Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree), `k` (an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n), and `adj` (a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree where each sublist contains the vertices adjacent to the vertex corresponding to the index of the list). The function returns the resulting structure of the tree or graph after removing `k` edges.**
