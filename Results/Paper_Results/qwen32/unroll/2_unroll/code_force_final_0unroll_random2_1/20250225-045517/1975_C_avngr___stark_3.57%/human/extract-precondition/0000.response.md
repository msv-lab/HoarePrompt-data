Precondition: **Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array a, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
