The code snippet provided reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The other variables `n` and the list `a` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input, representing the number of test cases; `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) for each test case.**
