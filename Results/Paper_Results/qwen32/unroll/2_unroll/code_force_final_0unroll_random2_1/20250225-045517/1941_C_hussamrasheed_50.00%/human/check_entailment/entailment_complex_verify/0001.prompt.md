You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        m = s.count('map')
        s = s.replace('map', '')
        p = s.count('pie')
        print(m + p)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        m = s.count('map')
        
        s = s.replace('map', '')
        
        p = s.count('pie')
        
        print(m + p)
        
    #State: For each test case, the number of occurrences of the substring 'map' plus the number of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s` after all 'map' occurrences have been removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. It then counts the occurrences of the substring 'map' in `s`, removes all occurrences of 'map' from `s`, and counts the occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the modified string. Finally, it prints the sum of these two counts for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string `s` to make it beautiful.
- A string is considered ugly if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map".
- We need to remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful, which means we need to count the occurrences of "pie" and "map" and remove those substrings.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the length of the string `n`.
   - It reads the string `s`.
   - It counts the occurrences of the substring "map" in `s` and stores it in `m`.
   - It removes all occurrences of "map" from `s` and stores the result in `s`.
   - It counts the occurrences of the substring "pie" in the modified `s` and stores it in `p`.
   - It prints the sum of `m` and `p`.

### Issues with the Provided Program:
1. **Counting and Removing Substrings:**
   - The program counts the occurrences of "map" and then removes them from the string `s`.
   - After removing "map", it counts the occurrences of "pie".
   - However, removing "map" might create new "pie" substrings that were not there initially. For example, if `s = "mapie"`, after removing "map", `s` becomes "ie", and no "pie" is counted, but the initial string was ugly due to "map".

2. **Non-Overlapping Substrings:**
   - The program does not account for overlapping substrings. For example, in the string "mapiepie", the program would count "map" once and "pie" once, but it should consider the possibility of overlapping substrings and find the minimum number of deletions required to remove all "pie" and "map" substrings.

3. **Minimum Deletions:**
   - The problem requires finding the minimum number of deletions to make the string beautiful. The provided program simply counts the number of "map" and "pie" substrings and sums them, which does not necessarily give the minimum deletions required.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It does not account for overlapping substrings and the possibility of creating new substrings after removing some.

Thus, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
