Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The program counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" in the string and then removes "map" to count the occurrences of "pie" in the modified string. However, this approach does not guarantee that the minimum number of characters are removed to make the string beautiful. 

For example, consider the string "ppiee". The program would count one "pie" and remove it, resulting in "pee" and not removing any "map" occurrences. However, the optimal solution is to remove the first two 'p's, resulting in "iee", which requires only 2 deletions.

A correct approach would involve using dynamic programming or other methods to find the minimum deletions required to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie" from the string.
