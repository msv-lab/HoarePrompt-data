The code snippet reads an integer value from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The values of `n`, `a`, `m`, and the queries `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input (1 <= t <= 10^4); for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^5, and for each query, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x, y <= n and x != y; `r` is a lambda function that reads and maps input to integers.**
