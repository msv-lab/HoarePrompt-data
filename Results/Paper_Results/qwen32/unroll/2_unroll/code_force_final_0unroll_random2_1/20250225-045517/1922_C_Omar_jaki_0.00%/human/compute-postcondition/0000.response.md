The provided code snippet defines a lambda function `r` that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer. This function does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, or any other variables directly. It merely prepares a function for future use to read and process input data.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^5, and for each query, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x, y <= n and x != y; `r` is a lambda function that reads and maps input to integers.**
