The code snippet `M += [w]` appends the value of `w` to the list `M`. The value of `w` is an integer and is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. The list `q` and its properties remain unchanged, and the operation `w = math.sqrt(q)` results in a TypeError, which is still valid. The list `M` now contains the value `w`.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` (1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9); `M` is a list containing the integer `w`; the operation `w = math.sqrt(q)` results in a TypeError; `w` is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**
