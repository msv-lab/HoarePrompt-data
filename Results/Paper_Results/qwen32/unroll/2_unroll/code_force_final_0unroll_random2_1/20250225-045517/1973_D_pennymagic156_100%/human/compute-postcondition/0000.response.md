The code snippet `n, k = func_3()` means that the function `func_3()` is called, and it returns a tuple of two values which are then assigned to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\). After the function call, the values of `n` and `k` will be whatever `func_3()` returns, but they must still satisfy the condition \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).

Since the exact return values of `func_3()` are not specified, we can only say that `n` and `k` will be updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, and they will still adhere to the given constraints.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, and they satisfy \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).**
