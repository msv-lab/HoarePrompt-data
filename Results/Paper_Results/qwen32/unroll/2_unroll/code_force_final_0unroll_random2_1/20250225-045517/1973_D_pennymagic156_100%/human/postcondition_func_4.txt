The function accepts no direct parameters but retrieves two positive integers `n` and `k` (where `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4`) from `func_3()`. It performs a series of operations involving calls to `func_2()` and prints specific queries based on the values of `n`, `k`, and a derived value `v`. The function ultimately prints either `! i * v` if a certain condition is met or `! -1` if the condition is not met, and then returns `None`.
