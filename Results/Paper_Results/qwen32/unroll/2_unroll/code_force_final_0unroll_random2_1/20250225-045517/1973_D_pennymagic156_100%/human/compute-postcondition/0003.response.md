To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's analyze the loop step-by-step:

1. The loop starts with `i` initialized to `n` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches 1.
2. In each iteration, the code prints a query `? 1 {i * n}` and then assigns the result of `func_2()` to `v`.
3. If `v` equals `n`, the loop breaks, and `v` is reassigned to the current value of `i`.

The loop will continue until it finds an `i` such that `func_2()` returns `n`. Once such an `i` is found, `v` is set to this value of `i`, and the loop terminates. If no such `i` is found (which theoretically shouldn't happen given the constraints), `v` would retain its last assigned value.

Since the problem does not specify the behavior of `func_2()`, we assume that `func_2()` will eventually return `n` for some `i` within the range, as per the loop's logic.

Therefore, the output state will be:
- `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- `v` will be the value of `i` for which `func_2()` returned `n`.

Output State: **n, k, and v (where v is the value of i for which func_2() returned n).**
