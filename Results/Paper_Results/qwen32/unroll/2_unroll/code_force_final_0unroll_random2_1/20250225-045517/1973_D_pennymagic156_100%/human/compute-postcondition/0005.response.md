To determine the output state, let's break down the loop and understand its behavior step by step:

1. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n // k`.
2. For each `i`, it initializes `cnt` to `k` and `l` to `1`.
3. It enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `cnt` is greater than `0` and `l` is less than `n + 1`.
4. Inside the `while` loop, it prints a query `? l i * v` and then calls `func_2()`, which presumably returns a value that is assigned to `l` after incrementing by 1.
5. It decrements `cnt` by 1 in each iteration of the `while` loop.
6. If `cnt` reaches `0` and `l` reaches `n + 1` (meaning the inner loop completed all `k` iterations without breaking early), it prints `! i * v` and calls `func_2()` before returning from the function.

The loop will terminate when either:
- `cnt` reaches `0` and `l` reaches `n + 1` (indicating a successful completion of the inner loop for a particular `i`), or
- The loop completes all iterations from `i = 1` to `i = n // k` without meeting the condition to print `! i * v`.

Given the loop's structure and the fact that it returns after printing `! i * v`, we can infer that the loop will terminate as soon as it finds the correct `i` that satisfies the condition `cnt == 0 and l == n + 1`.

The variables `n`, `k`, and `v` remain unchanged throughout the loop execution as they are not modified inside the loop. The variables `i`, `cnt`, and `l` are local to the loop and will not retain their values outside the loop.

Thus, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations (or terminates early if it finds a valid `i`) will be:

Output State: **n, k, v.**
