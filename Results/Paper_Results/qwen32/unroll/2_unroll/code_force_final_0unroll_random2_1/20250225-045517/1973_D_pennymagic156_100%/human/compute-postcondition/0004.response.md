To determine the state before the for loop starts, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and `k`.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n // k + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will execute if the range `(1, n // k + 1)` is non-empty, meaning `n // k + 1` must be greater than 1. This implies that `n // k` must be at least 1, or equivalently, `n` must be at least `k`.

The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 1 on the first iteration. The value of `v` (where `v` is the value of `i` for which `func_2()` returned `n`) is not directly related to the loop's execution but is mentioned in the context. Since `i` starts at 1, `v` should be at least 1 for the loop to have executed at least once.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `n` is at least `k` and `i` is 1 (since `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 1).

State: **`n` must be at least `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `v` is at least 1**
