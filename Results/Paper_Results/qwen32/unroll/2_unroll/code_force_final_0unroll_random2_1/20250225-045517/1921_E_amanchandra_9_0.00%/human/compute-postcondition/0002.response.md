Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b`. For each test case, `h` and `w` represent the dimensions of a grid, while `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` represent the coordinates of two distinct points on the grid. The function returns a value based on the relative positions of these points within the grid.**
