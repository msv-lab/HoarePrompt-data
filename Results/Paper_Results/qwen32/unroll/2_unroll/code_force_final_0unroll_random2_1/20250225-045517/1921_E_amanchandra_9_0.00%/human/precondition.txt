h and w are positive integers representing the dimensions of the board, where 1 ≤ h ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^9. x_a, y_a, x_b, and y_b are positive integers representing the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips, respectively, where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h and 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w. It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not coincide, i.e., either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b. The number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
