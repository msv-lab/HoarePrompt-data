The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a grid of dimensions `h` by `w` and two distinct points `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)` on this grid. For each test case, it prints 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' based on the relative positions of these points. The input values remain unchanged after processing each test case.
