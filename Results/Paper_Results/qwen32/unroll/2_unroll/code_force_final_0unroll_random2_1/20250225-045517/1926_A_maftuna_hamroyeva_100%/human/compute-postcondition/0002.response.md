Output State: **For each of the `t` test cases, the output will be either 'A' or 'B', depending on which character ('A' or 'B') appears more frequently in the respective 5-character string. If 'A' appears more times, 'A' is printed; otherwise, 'B' is printed. The value of `t` and the distinct 5-character strings remain unchanged.**
