### Reasoning:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine which letter ('A' or 'B') appears most frequently in each of the provided 5-character strings. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which denotes the number of test cases.
   - For each of these `t` test cases, it reads a string `a` of length 5.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The program initializes two counters, `l` and `h`, to zero. `l` is intended to count occurrences of 'A', and `h` is intended to count occurrences of 'B'.
   - It then iterates over each character `j` in the string `a`. If `j` is 'A', it increments `l` by 1; otherwise, it increments `h` by 1.

3. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After counting the occurrences, the program compares `l` and `h`.
   - If `l` (count of 'A') is greater than `h` (count of 'B'), it prints 'A'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'B'.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The problem states that the strings are of length 5 and consist only of 'A' and 'B'. Therefore, the program's logic of counting and comparing will always work since there are no other characters to consider.
   - The program also handles the case where the counts are equal by defaulting to 'B', which is consistent with the problem's requirement to output one of the letters in the case of a tie.

5. **Distinct Strings:**
   - The problem specifies that all `t` strings are distinct, but this does not affect the logic of counting and comparing the occurrences in each individual string.

The program correctly implements the required logic and will produce the expected output for the given problem description and example inputs.
