You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program:
import math

func_1()

def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        if x > 0 and y > 0:
            bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
            x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
            bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
            print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        elif x == 0 and y > 0:
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
        elif x > 0 and y == 0:
            print(math.ceil(x / 15))
        else:
            print(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the given conditions: the sum of the ceiling of `y/2` and the ceiling of the adjusted `x` value divided by 15, or simpler values depending on whether `x` or `y` is zero.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description.

1. **Function Call Before Definition**: The function `func_1()` is called before its definition, which will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Screens**:
    - The program incorrectly calculates the number of screens needed. Specifically, the formula used to calculate the number of screens for the 1x1 and 2x2 icons is flawed.
    - The correct approach is to first place as many 2x2 icons as possible, then fill the remaining spaces with 1x1 icons.

3. **Handling of Space on the Screen**:
    - Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means it has 15 cells.
    - A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.
    - The program should first place the 2x2 icons and then place the 1x1 icons in the remaining cells.

Let's consider a test case where the program will fail:
- Input: `1 1 1`
- Expected Output: `1`
- Program Output: `1` (this might seem correct at first glance, but let's consider another case)

- Input: `1 7 2`
- Expected Output: `1`
- Program Output: `1` (incorrect, the correct output should be `2`)

The program does not correctly calculate the number of screens needed for various combinations of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        screens = 0
        
        # Place as many 2x2 icons as possible
        screens += y
        used_cells = y * 4
        
        # Remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = 15 * screens - used_cells
        
        # Place 1x1 icons in the remaining cells
        if x > remaining_cells:
            screens += math.ceil((x - remaining_cells) / 15)
        
        print(screens)

import math
func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that we first place the 2x2 icons and then fill the remaining cells with 1x1 icons, correctly calculating the number of screens needed.
