You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

    print(func_2(case))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, and s is a string of length n containing only the characters "U" and "D".

    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())

    #State: `t` is the integer read from the input (1 <= t <= 100), `n` is the integer from the last iteration of the loop (1 <= n <= 100), `s` is the string from the last iteration of the loop containing only the characters "U" and "D", `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the `n` and `s` values from each iteration of the loop.
    return cases
    #The program returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the `n` and `s` values from each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". It returns a list of tuples, each containing the `n` and `s` values from each test case.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: case is a tuple where the first element is an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) representing the number of coins, and the second element is a string of length n consisting of characters 'U' and 'D', where 'U' represents a coin facing up and 'D' represents a coin facing down.
def func_2(case):
    ups = sum(1 for c in case[1] if c == 'U')
    return 'YES' if ups % 2 else 'NO'
    #The program returns 'YES' if the count of 'U' characters in the string part of `case` is even, otherwise it returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a tuple as input, where the first element is an integer representing the number of coins and the second element is a string of 'U' and 'D' characters indicating the orientation of each coin. It returns 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in the string is even, otherwise it returns 'NO'.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`). The key insight is that Alice will win if the number of facing-up coins is odd and Bob will win if it is even. This is because each player removes a facing-up coin and flips its adjacent coins, and the parity of the number of facing-up coins determines who will be forced into a losing position.

Here's a breakdown of the program:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function reads the input, which includes the number of test cases and the details of each test case (number of coins and the string representing the coins). It stores these details in a list of tuples.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function takes a single test case (a tuple containing the number of coins and the string) and counts the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`). It then returns `'YES'` if the count of `'U'` is odd and `'NO'` if it is even.

The program processes each test case independently and applies the same logic, which is consistent with the problem description. Given the problem constraints and the examples provided, the program correctly determines the winner for each test case. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the program to fail based on the provided logic.
