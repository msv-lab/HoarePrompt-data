Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty based on the problem description. The program attempts to split the array into two subsequences and calculate the penalty, but its logic is flawed and does not guarantee an optimal split.

The main issues are:
1. The program does not correctly identify and maintain the two subsequences `s` and `t` that minimize the penalty.
2. The logic for updating `a` and `b` does not ensure that the subsequences are being formed in a way that minimizes the number of increasing pairs.
3. The program does not handle all edge cases, such as arrays where all elements are the same or arrays with very few increasing pairs.

A correct approach would involve sorting the array and then splitting it into two subsequences in a way that minimizes the number of increasing pairs in each subsequence. This could be achieved by a more systematic approach, such as using dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm that carefully selects elements for each subsequence.

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect.
