### Reasoning:

The problem statement asks for the minimum penalty of splitting the array into two subsequences such that the sum of their penalties is minimized. The penalty for a subsequence is defined as the number of indices where the element at the next index is greater than the current one.

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to find the optimal split that minimizes the penalty. Instead, it seems to be counting elements based on some conditions related to the first and second elements that are greater than their predecessors, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Logic Mismatch**: The program attempts to find elements that are greater than the first and second elements that are greater than their predecessors. It then updates the count `c` based on certain conditions. This logic does not correspond to finding the optimal split of the array to minimize the penalty.

2. **Optimal Split**: To minimize the penalty, the optimal strategy would involve splitting the array in such a way that the number of increasing subsequences in both subsequences is minimized. This often involves a more sophisticated approach, such as dynamic programming or greedy algorithms, which is not implemented here.

3. **Example Verification**: The provided examples show that the correct answer is the minimum penalty achievable. For instance, in the first test case, the optimal split could be `s=[2,4,5]` and `t=[1,3]`, resulting in a penalty of `3`. However, the program's logic does not guarantee such an optimal split.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It does not implement an algorithm that finds the optimal split to minimize the penalty.

**Correctness: False**
