The only variable in the loop head is `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop will execute.

Given that `t` is the integer value of the input provided, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `t` is already in a range that ensures the loop will execute. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes the first time.

State: **`t` is the integer value of the input provided, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\); `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq n\); each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, denoting the i-th move you made, where \(1 \leq r_i, c_i \leq n\)**
