The variable `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will hold the integer value of the input provided. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). The values of `n`, `k`, and the subsequent moves (`r_i` and `c_i`) remain unchanged as they have not been modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the input provided, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\); `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq n\); each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, denoting the i-th move you made, where \(1 \leq r_i, c_i \leq n\).**
