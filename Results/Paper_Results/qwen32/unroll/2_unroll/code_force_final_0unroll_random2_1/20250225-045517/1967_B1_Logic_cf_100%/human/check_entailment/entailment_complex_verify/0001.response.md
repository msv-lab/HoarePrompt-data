### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning using the annotations and the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Program Analysis
The provided program is:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)
```

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.

2. **Initial Answer**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to `n`. This is correct because for \(b = 1\), every \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) satisfies the condition \(a + 1\) being a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1) = 1\).

3. **Loop for \(b > 1\)**:
   - The program iterates over \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates \((n + b) // (b * b)\) and adds this to `ans`.

#### Correctness Evaluation
- The formula \((n + b) // (b * b)\) is used to count the number of valid \(a\) for each \(b\).
- However, this formula does not correctly account for the condition involving \(\gcd(a, b)\). The formula assumes that \(\gcd(a, b) = 1\) for all \(a\), which is incorrect. The \(\gcd(a, b)\) can be any divisor of \(b\), and the formula should be adjusted accordingly.

#### Detailed Analysis Using Annotations
- **State Before Function Call**: Each test case consists of two positive integers \(n\) and \(m\) such that \(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\).
- **State Inside Loop**:
  - For each test case, `ans` is initialized to `n`.
  - The loop iterates \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\).
  - For each \(b\), the formula \((n + b) // (b * b)\) is used to update `ans`.

#### Validation of Original Assessment
- The original assessment correctly identifies that the formula \((n + b) // (b * b)\) does not account for \(\gcd(a, b)\).
- The formula assumes \(\gcd(a, b) = 1\) for all \(a\), which is incorrect.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions. The formula used does not properly account for the \(\gcd(a, b)\) in the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: False**
