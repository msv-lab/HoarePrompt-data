Reasoning:  
The provided Python program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). However, the provided program calculates `ans` by starting with `n` and adding to it the integer division of `(n + b)` by `(b * b)` for each `b` from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m`. This calculation does not correspond to the problem's requirement of checking the condition a + b being a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

To correctly solve the problem, the program should iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) within the given ranges and check if the condition a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b) holds. The current implementation does not perform this check and instead uses a different formula that does not guarantee the correct count of valid pairs.

Correctness: **False**
