### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's carefully analyze the problem description and the program's approach.

#### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program does the following:
1. Reads the number of test cases \(t\).
2. For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).
3. Initializes `ans` to \(n\).
4. Iterates \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\).
5. For each \(b\), it adds \((n + b) // (b \cdot b)\) to `ans`.
6. Prints the final `ans` for each test case.

#### Function Summary Recap:
The function summary describes the program's logic as adding \((n + b) // (b \cdot b)\) to `ans` for each \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\).

#### Original Assessment Recap:
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the given conditions. It provides a counterexample where the program's output matches the expected output, which seems to question the correctness of the assessment.

#### Detailed Evaluation:
Let's re-evaluate the logic:

The program's logic is:
\[ \text{ans} = n + \sum_{b=2}^{\min(n, m)} \left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b \cdot b} \right\rfloor \]

We need to verify if this logic correctly counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

For a given \(b\), we need to find all \(a\) such that:
\[ a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} \]
This can be simplified to:
\[ a \equiv -b \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} \]

The number of valid \(a\) for a given \(b\) can be derived from the fact that \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) minus \(b\). However, the provided program's logic seems to be derived from a different approach, possibly using some mathematical insight that simplifies the counting process.

The original assessment's counterexample (input `10 8` yielding output `14`) matches the program's output, indicating that the program might be correct after all. Let's verify another case manually to ensure consistency.

Consider another example:
Input:
```
1
3 5
```
Expected output:
- Valid pairs: \((1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)\)
- Output should be `5`.

Program's calculation:
\[ \text{ans} = 3 + \left\lfloor \frac{3 + 2}{2 \cdot 2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{3 + 3}{3 \cdot 3} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{3 + 4}{4 \cdot 4} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{3 + 5}{5 \cdot 5} \right\rfloor \]
\[ \text{ans} = 3 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3 \]

This does not match the expected output. Therefore, the program's logic seems flawed for this case.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate because the program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for all cases.

### Final: **False**
