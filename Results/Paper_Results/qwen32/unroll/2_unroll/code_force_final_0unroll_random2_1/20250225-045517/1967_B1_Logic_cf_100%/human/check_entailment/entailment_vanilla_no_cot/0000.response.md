Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down why the program is incorrect:

The problem asks for the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The provided program incorrectly calculates the number of valid pairs. Here are the issues:

1. The program initializes `ans` to `n`, which is not a correct starting point for the count of valid pairs.
2. The loop iterates over `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`, but it does not correctly calculate the number of valid `a` values for each `b`.
3. The expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` is not the correct way to determine the number of valid `a` values for each `b`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m` and for each `b`, determine the valid values of `a` from 1 to `n` that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly checks all pairs \((a, b)\) and counts those that satisfy the given condition. However, this solution may not be efficient enough for the given constraints, and further optimization would be necessary for very large inputs.
