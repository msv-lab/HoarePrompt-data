The function accepts a list of integers `row` representing river cell depths and an integer `d` representing the maximum distance between supports. It modifies the list by incrementing the first `d-1` elements by 1 and then each subsequent element by its original value, the minimum value of the previous `d` elements, and 1. Finally, it returns the last element of the modified list.
