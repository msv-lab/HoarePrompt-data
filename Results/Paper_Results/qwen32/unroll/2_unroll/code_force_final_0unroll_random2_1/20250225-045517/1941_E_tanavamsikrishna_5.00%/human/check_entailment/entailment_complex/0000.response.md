### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to understand if it correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Grid Representation**: The river is represented as a grid with `n` rows and `m` columns. The depth of each cell `(i, j)` is given by `a_{i,j}`.
2. **Bridge Construction**:
   - A bridge can be built on any row `i` from column `1` to column `m`.
   - Supports must be placed in cells `(i, 1)` and `(i, m)`.
   - The cost of placing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.
   - The distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
3. **Multiple Bridges**:
   - `k` bridges need to be built on consecutive rows.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost of installing supports for these `k` bridges.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum cost to build a bridge on a single row given the maximum distance `d` between supports.
   - It processes the row by incrementing the first `d-1` elements by `1` and then each subsequent element by its original value, the minimum value of the previous `d` elements, and `1`.
   - The function returns the last element of the modified list, which represents the total cost for that row.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles the input for multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid dimensions `n`, `m`, the number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance `d`.
   - It reads the grid `rows` and computes the cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then computes the total cost for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum of these total costs.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost.

#### Verification:
- **Correctness of `func_1`**:
  - The function correctly processes the row to ensure that supports are placed according to the rules.
  - It ensures that the cost is minimized by considering the minimum value of the previous `d` elements for each position.
- **Correctness of `func_2`**:
  - The function correctly reads and processes the input for each test case.
  - It calculates the total cost for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.
  - The approach ensures that the constraints are respected and the minimum cost is found.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It processes each row to find the minimum cost of building a bridge and then finds the minimum total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges.

**Correctness: True**
