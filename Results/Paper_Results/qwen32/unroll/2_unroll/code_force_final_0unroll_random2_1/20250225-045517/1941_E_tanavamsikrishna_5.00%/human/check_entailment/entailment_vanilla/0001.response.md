Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided solution to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Grid Representation**: The river is represented as an `n x m` grid where `a[i][j]` is the depth of the cell at row `i` and column `j`. The first and last columns are river banks and have a depth of 0.

2. **Bridge Construction**: We need to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows. Each bridge spans from the first column to the last column of a row. Supports must be placed in the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.

3. **Cost Calculation**: The cost of placing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a[i][j] + 1`. The goal is to minimize the total cost of placing supports for all `k` bridges.

### Solution Analysis

Let's break down the provided solution:

#### Function `func_1(row: List[int], d: int)`

- **Purpose**: This function calculates the minimum cost to place supports in a single row such that the distance between adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
- **Implementation**:
  - The first loop initializes the first `d-1` cells by adding 1 to their depth (since supports must be placed here).
  - The second loop iterates from `d-1` to the end of the row. For each cell, it calculates the minimum cost to place a support considering the previous `d` cells (excluding the current cell) and adds 1 to the current cell's depth.
  - The function returns the cost of placing supports in the last cell of the row.

#### Function `func_2()`

- **Purpose**: This function reads the input, computes the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`, and then finds the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.
- **Implementation**:
  - It reads the number of rows `n`, columns `m`, number of bridges `k`, and maximum distance `d`.
  - It reads the grid of depths.
  - It computes the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`.
  - It calculates the total cost for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum among them.
  - It prints the minimum total cost.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Cost Calculation in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost to place supports in a single row by considering the constraints on the distance between supports.
   - However, the implementation of `func_1` does not correctly handle the placement of supports with the given constraints. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum cost for each cell does not correctly enforce the constraint that the distance between adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.

2. **Total Cost Calculation in `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly calculates the total cost for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum among them.
   - However, since `func_1` does not correctly calculate the cost for each row, the overall solution is incorrect.

### Conclusion

The provided solution is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to place supports in a single row while satisfying the constraints on the distance between supports.

**Correctness: False**
