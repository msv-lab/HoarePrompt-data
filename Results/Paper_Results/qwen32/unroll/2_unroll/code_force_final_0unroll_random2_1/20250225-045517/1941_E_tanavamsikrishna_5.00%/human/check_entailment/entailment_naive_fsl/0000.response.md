Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - This function calculates the cost of placing supports in a single row.
    - The first loop sets the cost of the first `d-1` cells to `row[i] + 1`, which is incorrect. The problem states that supports must be placed in the first and last columns, so `row[0]` and `row[-1]` should always be `row[0] + 1` and `row[-1] + 1` respectively.
    - The second loop is intended to calculate the cost of placing supports while ensuring that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`. However, it does not correctly handle the placement of supports such that the distance constraint is met. The logic inside the loop is flawed and does not guarantee the minimum cost while adhering to the constraints.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
    - This function reads the input, calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`, and then tries to find the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.
    - The calculation of `total_costs` is correct in the sense that it sums the costs of `k` consecutive rows, but the issue lies in the incorrect implementation of `func_1`.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
4 5 2 2
0 1 1 1 0
0 2 2 2 0
0 2 1 1 0
0 3 2 1 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
8
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- To minimize the cost, we can place supports in the second and third rows as follows:
    - Second row: Supports at (2,1), (2,3), (2,5) → Cost = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5
    - Third row: Supports at (3,1), (3,3), (3,5) → Cost = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5
- Total cost = 5 + 5 = 10

However, the provided program will not correctly calculate this cost due to the flawed logic in `func_1`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the output is **False**.
