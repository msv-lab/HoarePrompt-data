### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided solution, we need to analyze the implementation of `func_1` and `func_2` in detail.

#### Function `func_1(row: List[int], d: int)`

1. **Purpose**: This function calculates the minimum cost to place supports in a single row such that the distance between adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

2. **Implementation**:
   - The first loop initializes the first `d-1` cells by adding 1 to their depth. This part seems correct for placing supports in the first `d-1` cells.
   - The second loop iterates from `d-1` to the end of the row. For each cell, it calculates the minimum cost to place a support considering the previous `d` cells (excluding the current cell) and adds 1 to the current cell's depth. However, this logic has a flaw. The calculation `(min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1` does not correctly ensure that the distance between adjacent supports is no more than `d`. It does not enforce the placement of supports such that the distance constraint is met. Instead, it simply considers the minimum value among the previous `d` cells, which does not guarantee that supports are placed within `d` distance of each other.

3. **Flaw**: The function `func_1` does not correctly enforce the constraint that the distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than `d`. It incorrectly calculates the minimum cost without ensuring that supports are placed within the required distance.

#### Function `func_2()`

1. **Purpose**: This function reads the input, computes the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`, and then finds the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.

2. **Implementation**:
   - It reads the number of rows `n`, columns `m`, number of bridges `k`, and maximum distance `d`.
   - It reads the grid of depths.
   - It computes the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It calculates the total cost for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum among them.
   - It prints the minimum total cost.

3. **Flaw**: Since `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for each row while satisfying the constraints, the overall solution is incorrect.

### Conclusion

The provided solution is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to place supports in a single row while satisfying the constraints on the distance between supports. The original assessment accurately identifies this flaw.

**Final: False**
