Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n`, `m`, `k`, `d` are variables, but their specific values are not provided.
- `rows` is not used in the given code snippet.
- `costs` is a list of integers.
- `total_costs` is a list of sums of every `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(min(total_costs))
```

### Analysis:
1. **`total_costs` Calculation**:
   - `total_costs` is derived by summing every `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.
   - For example, if `costs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `k = 2`, then `total_costs` would be `[1+2, 2+3, 3+4, 4+5]` which is `[3, 5, 7, 9]`.

2. **`min(total_costs)`**:
   - The `min` function will find the smallest value in the `total_costs` list.
   - Given the example above, `min([3, 5, 7, 9])` would return `3`.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact values of `costs` and `k` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `min(total_costs)`. However, we know that it will be the smallest sum of every `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.

Output: **min(total_costs) (where total_costs is a list of sums of every k consecutive elements from the costs list)**
