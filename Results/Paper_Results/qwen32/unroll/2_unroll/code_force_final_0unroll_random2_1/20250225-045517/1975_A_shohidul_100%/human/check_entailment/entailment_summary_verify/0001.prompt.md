You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])
                    new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])
                    if check_all_new and new_all:
                        print('YES')
                        break
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                        break



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines if the list `a` is non-decreasing or can be made non-decreasing by removing a prefix of elements such that the remaining list is non-decreasing and the first element of the original list is greater than or equal to all elements of the new list. It outputs 'YES' if either condition is met, otherwise 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where we split the array into two parts and swap these parts.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - It checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`.
   - If the array is already sorted, it prints "YES".

3. **Main Logic:**
   - If the array is not sorted, it iterates through the array to find the first position `i` where `a[i - 1] > a[i]`.
   - It then checks if the subarray from `i` to the end (`a[i:]`) can be concatenated with the prefix (`a[:i]`) in such a way that the resulting array is sorted.
   - Specifically, it checks two conditions:
     - `a[0] >= new[i]` for all `i` in `new` (where `new = a[i:]`), ensuring that the largest element in the prefix is not less than the smallest element in the suffix.
     - `new[i - 1] <= new[i]` for all `i` in `new`, ensuring that the suffix itself is sorted.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES" and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the conditions are not satisfied, it prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Multiple Break Points:**
   - The program breaks out of the loop after checking the first unsorted position. However, it should continue checking other possible split points.
   - For example, in the second test case of the sample input, the program would incorrectly print "NO" after checking the first unsorted position.

2. **Logic for Checking Sortedness:**
   - The program only checks the first unsorted position and does not consider other potential split points that could result in a sorted array.
   - It should iterate over all possible split points and check if any of them can result in a sorted array.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible cases. It only checks the first unsorted position and does not consider other potential split points.

Correctness: **False**
