To determine the output state of the given loop, we need to understand the logic and how the variables change through each iteration. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. **Initialization**: The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. **Input Handling**: For each test case, the values of `n` (number of participants) and `m` (number of screenshots) are read.
3. **Single Screenshot Case**: If `m == 1`, it means there is only one screenshot, and the output is always `'yes'`.
4. **Multiple Screenshot Case**: If `m > 1`, the first two screenshots are processed:
   - `a1, *l1` and `a2, *l2` are extracted from the first two lines of input.
   - `l11` and `l22` are created by removing `a2` from `l1` and `a1` from `l2`, respectively.
   - If `l11` and `l22` are not equal, the remaining screenshots are skipped, and the output is `'no'`.
5. **Comparison of Lists**:
   - `idx1` and `idx2` are initialized to `-1` and are used to track the positions where `a2` and `a1` first appear in `l1` and `l2`, respectively.
   - `p1` and `p2` are used to handle the offset caused by the insertion of `a2` and `a1` in the lists.
   - The loop iterates through the lists to find the first mismatch and determine the positions of `a2` and `a1`.
6. **Insertion and Comparison**:
   - Depending on the values of `idx1` and `idx2`, `a2` is inserted into `l2` or `a1` into `l1` at the appropriate position.
   - If `m == 2`, the output is `'yes'`.
   - For `m > 2`, the remaining screenshots are processed, and the lists are compared to ensure consistency.
7. **Final Output**: If all comparisons are consistent, the output is `'yes'`; otherwise, it is `'no'`.

Given the above logic, the output state after all iterations will depend on the input values but will always be a series of `'yes'` or `'no'` outputs for each test case.

Output State: **A series of 'yes' or 'no' outputs for each test case.**
