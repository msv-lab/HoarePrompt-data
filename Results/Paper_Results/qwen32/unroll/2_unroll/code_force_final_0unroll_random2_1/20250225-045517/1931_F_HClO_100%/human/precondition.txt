t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of chat participants, and a list of lists. The list of lists contains k lists (1 ≤ k ≤ n), where each inner list contains n distinct integers (1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n) representing the order of participants as seen by the participant who took the screenshot. The sum of n · k across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. All participants who took screenshots are distinct.
