Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it assumes that the order of participants in the screenshots, excluding the author, should match after swapping the author's position. However, this is not always true. Let's consider a detailed example to demonstrate this:

### Example Case:
Input:
```
1
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
2 1 3 4 5
3 2 1 4 5
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Explanation:
- The first screenshot shows the order `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` with `1` at the top.
- The second screenshot shows the order `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5]` with `2` at the top.
- The third screenshot shows the order `[3, 2, 1, 4, 5]` with `3` at the top.

This is a valid scenario where the order `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` works for all three screenshots.

### How the Program Fails:
The program's logic involves comparing the lists after removing the author and checking if they match. However, it does not correctly handle cases where the order can be consistent without the lists being identical after removing the author. Specifically, the program's logic for handling more than two screenshots is flawed.

### Problematic Code Section:
```python
if l11 != l22:
    for _ in range(m - 2):
        input()
    print('no')
    continue
```
This part of the code immediately returns 'no' if the lists do not match after removing the authors, which is incorrect.

### Another Example Case:
Input:
```
1
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
2 1 3 4 5
3 1 2 4 5
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Explanation:
- The first screenshot shows the order `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` with `1` at the top.
- The second screenshot shows the order `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5]` with `2` at the top.
- The third screenshot shows the order `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]` with `3` at the top.

This is a valid scenario where the order `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` works for all three screenshots. However, the program would incorrectly return 'no' because the lists after removing the authors do not match exactly.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases, especially when the order of participants can be consistent without the lists being identical after removing the author. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
