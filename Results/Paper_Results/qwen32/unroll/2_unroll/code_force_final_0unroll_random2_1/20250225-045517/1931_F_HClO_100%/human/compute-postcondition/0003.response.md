Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of participants and `k` is the number of screenshots. It also accepts `k` lines of `n` distinct integers each, representing the order of participants in each screenshot. The function returns a list of integers where each integer corresponds to the position of the author of the screenshot in the final ranking of participants.**
