In the given task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable that doesn't affect the loop's execution directly. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute:

1. **Loop Variable `_`**: This is a throwaway variable, so no specific state needs to be adjusted for this variable.
2. **Variable `t`**: The loop will execute `t` times. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.

The state of `n`, `k`, and the list of integers `a_{ij}` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. The loop will iterate `t` times regardless of the values of `n`, `k`, and `a_{ij}`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure it is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
