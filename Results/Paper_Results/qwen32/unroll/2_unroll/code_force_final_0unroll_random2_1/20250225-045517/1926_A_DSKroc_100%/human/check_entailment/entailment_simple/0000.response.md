### Reasoning:
The provided Python program correctly solves the problem of determining which letter ('A' or 'B') appears most frequently in each of the given strings of length 5. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates `t` times, each time reading a string `s` of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'.

2. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - For each string `s`, the program initializes two counters, `ac` and `bc`, to zero. These counters are used to count the number of occurrences of 'A' and 'B' respectively.
   - It then iterates through each character in the string `s`. If the character is 'A', it increments `ac`. Otherwise, it increments `bc`.

3. **Comparison and Output**:
   - After counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', the program compares the values of `ac` and `bc`.
   - If `ac` is greater than `bc`, it prints 'A', indicating that 'A' appears more frequently in the string.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'B', indicating that 'B' appears more frequently or that both 'A' and 'B' appear with equal frequency, but the problem does not specify a preference in the latter case, so printing 'B' is acceptable.

4. **Distinct Strings**:
   - The problem states that all `t` strings are distinct, but the program does not need to handle this explicitly as it processes each string independently.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine which letter ('A' or 'B') appears most frequently in each string of length 5 for each test case. The annotated program states match the expected behavior and there are no logical errors in the implementation.
