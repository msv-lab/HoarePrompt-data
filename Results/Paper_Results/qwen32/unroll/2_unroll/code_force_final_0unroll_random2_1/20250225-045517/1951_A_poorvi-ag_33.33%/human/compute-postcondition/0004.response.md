In the given for loop, the only object in the loop head is the variable `r`. The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list, assigning each element to `r` in each iteration. For the loop to execute at least once, the `results` list must contain at least one element.

Given that the `results` list is described as a list of 'yes' or 'no' based on the input strings in each iteration, we need to ensure that this list has at least one such element.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the `results` list contains at least one element, which can be either 'yes' or 'no'.

State: **`results` is a list of 'yes' or 'no' based on the input strings in each iteration, and `results` must have at least one element**
