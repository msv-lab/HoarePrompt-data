To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's break down the code and understand its behavior:

The loop runs `t` times. In each iteration:
1. An integer `n` is read from the input (though `n` is not used in the loop body).
2. A string `arr` is read from the input.
3. The code checks the number of '1's in the string `arr` and whether '11' is a substring of `arr`.
4. Depending on these conditions, the string 'yes' or 'no' is appended to the `results` list.

The conditions for appending 'yes' or 'no' are as follows:
- If `arr.count('1') == 2` and '11' is in `arr`, append 'no'.
- If `arr.count('1')` is even and not both `arr.count('1') == 2` and '11' in `arr`, append 'yes'.
- In all other cases, append 'no'.

After the loop finishes, the `results` list will contain `t` elements, each determined by the conditions above.

Given that the initial state of `results` is an empty list and `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, these variables remain unchanged by the loop.

The output state will be the final state of the `results` list after all iterations.

Output State: **results is a list of 'yes' or 'no' based on the input strings in each iteration.**
