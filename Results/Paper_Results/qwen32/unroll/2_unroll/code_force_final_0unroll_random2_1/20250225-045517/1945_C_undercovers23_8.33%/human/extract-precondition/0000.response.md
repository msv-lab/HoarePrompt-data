Precondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses. The next line contains a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1, where a_j = 0 if the j-th house wants to live on the left side of the street, and a_j = 1 if the j-th house wants to live on the right side. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.**
