To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. The loop in the given code is:

```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. The variable `t` is already provided as the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).

Since the loop will execute `t` times, the only state we need to ensure is that `t` is at least 1. Given that the problem statement specifies \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `t` is already guaranteed to be a valid number for the loop to execute.

Thus, no additional adjustments to the state are necessary for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\)**
