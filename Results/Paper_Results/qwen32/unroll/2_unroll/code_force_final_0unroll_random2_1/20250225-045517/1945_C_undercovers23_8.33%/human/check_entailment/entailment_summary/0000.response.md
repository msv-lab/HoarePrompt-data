### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided Python program and verify if it correctly solves the problem as described.

The program aims to find the optimal position to place the road such that at least half of the residents on each side of the road are satisfied with their side. The program iterates through each possible position to place the road (between houses) and checks the conditions.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of houses `n` and their preferences as a string `s`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It calculates `pk` as `n // 2` (integer division), which is used to determine the middle of the village.
   - It counts the total number of '1's (`o`) and '0's (`z`) in the string `s`.

3. **Iterating Through Possible Positions:**
   - The program iterates through each possible position `i` to place the road (between houses `i` and `i+1`).
   - It keeps track of the number of '0's (`zero`) and '1's (`one`) encountered on the left side of the road.
   - It calculates the percentage of '0's on the left side (`zero_perc`) and '1's on the right side (`one_perc`).
   - If both percentages are at least 50%, it adds the position `i + 1` to a list of valid positions.

4. **Finding the Optimal Position:**
   - It finds the valid position that is closest to the middle (`pk`).
   - If no valid position is found, it checks the overall preference:
     - If more than 50% of residents prefer the right side, it defaults to position `n`.
     - Otherwise, it defaults to position `0`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the optimal position for each test case.

### Issues and Corrections:
- The program calculates `zero_perc` and `one_perc` as percentages multiplied by 100, which is incorrect. The conditions should be checked based on the actual counts, not percentages.
- The calculation `zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))` and `one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))` should be `zero >= math.ceil((i + 1) / 2)` and `one >= math.ceil((n - i - 1) / 2)` respectively.
- The program correctly handles the case where no valid position is found by checking the overall preference.

### Corrected Code:
```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        pk = n // 2
        sl = list(s)
        o = sl.count('1')
        z = sl.count('0')
        (zero, one) = (0, 0)
        lst = []
        mini = pow(10, 8)
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero += 1
            else:
                one += 1
            if zero >= math.ceil((i + 1) / 2) and one >= math.ceil((n - i - 1) / 2):
                lst.append(i + 1)
        for ele in lst:
            mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))
        final = []
        for elem in lst:
            if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
                final.append(elem)
        final.sort()
        if len(final) == 0:
            c1 = o * 100 // n
            if c1 >= 50:
                final.append(0)
            else:
                final.append(n)
        print(final[0])

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program contains a logical error in the calculation of `zero_perc` and `one_perc`. After correcting this, the program should work as intended.

Correctness: **False**
