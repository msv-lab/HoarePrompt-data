The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of houses and their preferences for living on either the left or right side of a street. For each test case, it determines the optimal position to divide the houses such that at least 50% of the houses on each side of the division prefer living on that side. If no such position exists, it defaults to either the start or end of the street based on the overall preference. The function outputs the optimal position for each test case.
