Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each defined by `n` people, `m` friendships, and a threshold `k`. For each friendship, it considers the friendship factor `f_i`. It computes and outputs a result for each test case based on these inputs, formatted as an integer. The result is derived from a specific mathematical computation involving the sum of friendship factors, combinations of people, and the threshold value, reduced modulo \(10^9 + 7\).**
