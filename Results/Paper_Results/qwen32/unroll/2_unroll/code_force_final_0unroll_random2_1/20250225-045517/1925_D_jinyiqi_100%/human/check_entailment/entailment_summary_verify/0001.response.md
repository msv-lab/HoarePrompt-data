### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if the logic and calculations are correct.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Objective:** Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions, expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and then \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).
- **Inputs:** 
  - `t`: number of test cases.
  - For each test case, `n`: number of children, `m`: number of pairs of friends, `k`: number of excursions.
  - For each pair of friends, their indices and initial friendship value.
- **Output:** For each test case, the expected value modulo \(10^9+7\).

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads `m` lines, each containing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value.

2. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values (`sum_f`):**
   - The program correctly calculates the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends (`sum_f`).

3. **Total Number of Possible Pairs (`cn2`):**
   - The program correctly calculates the total number of possible pairs of children (`cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2`).

4. **Calculating Numerator (`p`) and Denominator (`q`):**
   - The provided formula for `p` and `q` is:
     \[
     p = 2 \cdot k \cdot cn2 \cdot sum_f + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
     \]
     \[
     q = 2 \cdot cn2^2
     \]
   - **Evaluation of the Formula:**
     - **Numerator (`p`):** The term `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f` seems to account for the expected contribution of the initial friendship values. However, the term `m * k * (k - 1)` seems incorrect. This term suggests that each pair of friends contributes `k * (k - 1)` to the numerator, which does not align with the problem's requirement to consider the probability of picking each pair and the increase in friendship values over time.
     - **Denominator (`q`):** The term `2 * cn2^2` seems incorrect. The denominator should reflect the total number of ways to choose pairs over `k` excursions, which is more complex than just the square of the total number of pairs.

5. **Simplification and Modular Inverse:**
   - The program correctly simplifies the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (`gcd`).
   - It correctly calculates the modular inverse of `q` modulo \(10^9+7\) using `pow(q, -1, M)`.
   - It correctly calculates the result as `p * q^{-1} % M` and prints it.

#### Correct Approach:
- **Expected Value Calculation:**
  - The expected value calculation involves considering the probability of picking each pair of friends and the increase in friendship values over time.
  - The expected contribution of each pair to the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions can be calculated using combinatorial probability.
  - The correct formula for the expected value is more complex and involves summing the contributions of each pair over all possible excursions, taking into account the probability of being chosen and the increase in friendship values.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the expected value calculation based on the problem description. The formula used for `p` and `q` does not accurately represent the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
