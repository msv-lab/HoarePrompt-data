Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. Here, `n` is the number of people, `m` is the number of friendships, and `k` is a threshold value. It also receives `m` lines of input, each containing three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, representing a friendship between person `a_i` and person `b_i` with a friendship factor `f_i`. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given inputs, but the specific output criteria are not detailed in the provided information.**
