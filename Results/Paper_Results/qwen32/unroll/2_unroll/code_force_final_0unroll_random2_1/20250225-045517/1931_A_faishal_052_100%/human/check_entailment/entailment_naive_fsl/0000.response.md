Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to a given encoded integer `n`.
- The letters are numbered from 1 to 26, 'a' = 1, 'z' = 26.
- The program should output the lexicographically smallest word for each test case.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Reading the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the encoded integer `lex`.
3. It then tries to construct a list `arr` of three numbers that sum to `lex` by:
   - Checking if `lex` is less than 28, and if so, appending 1 to `arr` and reducing `lex` by 1.
   - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and reduces `lex` by 26.
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 78, it appends 26 to `arr` and reduces `lex` by 26.
4. The remaining value of `lex` is appended to `arr`.
5. The list `arr` is sorted.
6. The sorted list `arr` is converted to a string of characters and printed.

### Issues in the Program:
The logic in the program is flawed and does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word for all possible values of `n`.

#### Example of a Faulty Case:
Consider `n = 78`. The program will:
- Append 26 to `arr` twice, reducing `lex` to 26.
- Append 26 to `arr` again, reducing `lex` to 0.
- Sort `arr` which remains [26, 26, 26].
- Convert this to the string "zzz".

However, the lexicographically smallest word that sums to 78 is "rzz" (18 + 26 + 26 = 70 + 8 = 78), not "zzz".

### Conclusion:
The program does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word for all possible values of `n`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
