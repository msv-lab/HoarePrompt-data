### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies several critical issues with the program's logic. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Incorrect Decoding Logic**:
   - The program's loop only runs twice, which is insufficient to handle all possible sums between 3 and 78. Specifically, when the sum is between 28 and 52, the program incorrectly appends 26 twice, which is not always the smallest possible combination.
   - The logic does not correctly handle cases where the sum of the first two letters is less than 52 but more than 26. It should independently determine the smallest possible values for each letter to ensure the smallest lexicographical word.

2. **Sorting**:
   - Sorting the list `arr` after appending values does not guarantee the smallest lexicographical word. The values should be chosen in a way that respects the order of letters in the alphabet.

3. **Example Verification**:
   - Consider the test case with the encoded value 24. The program would incorrectly handle this by appending 26 twice and then 1, resulting in the list `[26, 26, 1]`. Sorting this list gives `[1, 26, 26]`, which corresponds to the word "aaz". However, the correct smallest lexicographical word is "aav" (1, 1, 22).
   - Similarly, for the encoded value 70, the program would append 26 twice and then 18, resulting in the list `[26, 26, 18]`. Sorting this list gives `[18, 26, 26]`, which corresponds to the word "rst". However, the correct smallest lexicographical word is "rzz" (18, 26, 26).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for all possible encoded values. The issues identified in the original assessment are valid, and the program needs to be revised to handle all cases correctly.

**Final: False**
