The code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `cases`. This input represents the number of test cases, which was previously denoted by `t`. After this assignment, `t` is no longer mentioned in the code snippet, and `cases` now holds the value that `t` initially held. The constraints on `t` (1 <= t <= 100) apply to `cases` as well. The variable `n` and its constraints (3 <= n <= 78) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, and for each of the `cases` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 78.**
