### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description, the code, and the provided function summary.

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The task is to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to a given integer `n` (where `n` is between 3 and 78).
   - The letters are mapped to their positions in the alphabet (1 for 'a', 2 for 'b', ..., 26 for 'z').

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex`.
   - The program attempts to decode `lex` into three values by appending either 1 or 26 to a list `arr` based on the value of `lex`.
   - After appending values, it sorts the list and converts the values to characters.

3. **Issues in the Program**:
   - The current logic for appending values to `arr` is flawed. It does not correctly handle all possible sums between 3 and 78.
   - The logic appends either 1 or 26 in a way that does not guarantee the smallest lexicographical word.
   - The sorting step does not address the issue of finding the smallest combination of letters.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To find the lexicographically smallest word, we need to systematically try combinations of three letters such that their sum equals `lex`.
   - We should start with the smallest possible values for the first letter and incrementally try larger values for the second and third letters.

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to adjust the logic to ensure we find the smallest lexicographical combination:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Iterate over possible values for the first letter
        for a in range(1, 27):
            # Iterate over possible values for the second letter
            for b in range(1, 27):
                # Calculate the value for the third letter
                c = lex - a - b
                # Check if the third letter is valid
                if 1 <= c <= 26:
                    # Print the lexicographically smallest word
                    print(chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96))
                    break
            else:
                continue
            break

# Example usage
# func()
```

### Evaluation:
The original program does not correctly find the lexicographically smallest word for all possible sums between 3 and 78. It uses an incorrect and incomplete logic for decoding the sum into three letters.

**Final: False**
