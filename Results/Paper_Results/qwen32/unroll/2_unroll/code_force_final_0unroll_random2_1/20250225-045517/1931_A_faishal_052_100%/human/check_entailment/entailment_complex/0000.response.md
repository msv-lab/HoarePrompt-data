### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` which represents the encoded word.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the three values corresponding to the positions of the letters in the word.
   - It then enters a loop that runs twice to determine the first two values of `arr`:
     - If `lex` is less than 28, it appends 1 to `arr` and decrements `lex` by 1.
     - If `lex` is between 28 and 51, it appends 26 to `arr` and decrements `lex` by 26.
     - If `lex` is between 52 and 78, it again appends 26 to `arr` and decrements `lex` by 26.
   - After the loop, the remaining value of `lex` is appended to `arr`.
   - The list `arr` is then sorted.

3. **Generating the Output:**
   - For each test case, the program converts the sorted list of three values into characters by adding 96 to each value (since 'a' is 97 in ASCII).
   - It concatenates these characters to form the lexicographically smallest word and prints it.

### Analysis:

- **Logic for Determining Values:**
  - The logic for determining the first two values in `arr` is flawed. The program uses a conditional structure that doesn't correctly distribute the values to achieve the smallest lexicographical order.
  - For example, if `lex` is 24, the program will append 1, 1, and 22 (in some order) to `arr` and then sort it to get [1, 1, 22], which corresponds to "aab". However, the correct output should be "aav" (1, 1, 22 should be correctly distributed to ensure the smallest lexicographical order).

- **Sorting:**
  - Sorting the list `arr` ensures that the values are in ascending order, but the initial distribution of values is incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded value. The logic for distributing the values into `arr` is flawed, leading to incorrect outputs.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
