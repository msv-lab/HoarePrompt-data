Let's carefully analyze the provided program and verify its correctness based on the problem description and the function summary.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires determining the minimum number of 5x3 screens needed to place a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons. Each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns).

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 icons (`a`) and 2x2 icons (`b`). The program then calculates the minimum number of screens required.

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `n` is read.
   - For each test case, the number of 1x1 icons `a` and 2x2 icons `b` are read.

2. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The number of screens required for 2x2 icons is calculated as `t = b // 2`. If `b` is odd, one additional screen is needed, hence `t = b // 2 + 1`.
   - This part seems correct as placing each 2x2 icon requires 4 cells, and we need to account for the extra screen if there's an odd number of 2x2 icons.

3. **Calculating Remaining Space:**
   - The total cells used by 2x2 icons is `b * 4`.
   - The remaining cells available after placing 2x2 icons on `t` screens is `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - If the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`t1 >= a`), no additional screens are needed.
   - If not, the number of additional screens required for 1x1 icons is calculated. If the remaining icons `t2 = a - t1` can fill a full screen (15 cells), then `t2 // 15` additional screens are needed. Otherwise, one more screen is required (`t2 // 15 + 1`).

4. **Output:**
   - The total number of screens `t` is printed for each test case.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the program with the first test case:
- Input: `1 1`
- Calculation:
  - `t = 1 // 2 + 1 = 1`
  - Remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons: `1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`
  - Since `11 >= 1`, no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `1` (correct)

Let's verify another test case:
- Input: `7 2`
- Calculation:
  - `t = 2 // 2 + 1 = 2`
  - Remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons: `2 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 22`
  - Since `22 >= 7`, no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `2` (correct)

Let's verify a more complex test case:
- Input: `12 4`
- Calculation:
  - `t = 4 // 2 + 1 = 3`
  - Remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons: `3 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 19`
  - Since `19 >= 12`, no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `2` (incorrect, should be `2` screens, but let's verify the logic)

Let's verify the logic for a case with many 2x2 icons:
- Input: `0 9`
- Calculation:
  - `t = 9 // 2 + 1 = 5`
  - Remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons: `5 * 15 - 9 * 4 = 15`
  - Since `15 >= 0`, no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `5` (correct)

### Detailed Reasoning:
The logic for calculating the number of screens for 2x2 icons is correct. However, the logic for calculating the remaining space and additional screens for 1x1 icons needs re-evaluation.

The calculation `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` is correct, but the logic for determining additional screens for 1x1 icons is flawed. Specifically, the calculation `t2 = a - t1` and the subsequent logic to determine additional screens is incorrect.

For example, in the case `12 4`:
- `t = 3`
- `t1 = 3 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 19`
- Since `19 >= 12`, no additional screens are needed, but this is incorrect because we can only fit 12 icons in 2 screens (one with 4 2x2 icons and one with 8 1x1 icons).

### Corrected Logic:
1. Calculate the number of screens for 2x2 icons.
2. Calculate the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons.
3. Determine if the remaining cells can fit the 1x1 icons. If not, calculate the additional screens needed.

### Correct Implementation:
Let's correct the implementation:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b // 2
        if b % 2 != 0:
            t += 1
        remaining_cells = t * 15 - b * 4
        if remaining_cells < a:
            additional_screens = (a - remaining_cells + 14) // 15
            t += additional_screens
        print(t)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the logic for determining additional screens for 1x1 icons is flawed. The corrected logic is provided above.

Final: **False**
