Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It interactively queries up to 3n times by providing four indices to receive comparison results of bitwise OR operations on elements of a permutation. The function's goal is to determine and return a pair of indices such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices is maximized.**
