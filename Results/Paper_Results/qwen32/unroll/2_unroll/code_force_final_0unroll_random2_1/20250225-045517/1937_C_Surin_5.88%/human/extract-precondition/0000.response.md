Precondition: **There are multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a permutation p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1} of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The function can interactively query up to 3n times per test case by providing four indices a, b, c, and d (0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n) to receive a comparison result of (p_a | p_b) and (p_c | p_d). The function's goal is to determine a pair of indices i and j (0 ≤ i, j < n) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized.**
