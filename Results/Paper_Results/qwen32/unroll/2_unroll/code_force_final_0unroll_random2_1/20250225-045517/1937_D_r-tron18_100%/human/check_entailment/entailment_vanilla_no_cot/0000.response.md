Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the functions `func_1` and `func_2` is overly complex and does not accurately simulate the movement of the pinball according to the rules provided in the problem description. The program does not correctly handle the inversion of characters after the pinball moves and does not properly calculate the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query.

A correct solution would involve simulating the movement of the pinball for each starting position, keeping track of the number of moves, and inverting the characters as specified. The program provided does not follow these steps accurately, leading to incorrect results.
