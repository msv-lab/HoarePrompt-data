The code snippet initializes a list `suffZero` with a single element `0`. No other variables are affected by this code.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the sum of the initial value (0) and all the elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element `0`.**
