Functionality: **The function takes a string `s1` of length `n` composed of '<' and '>' characters and computes a list of values based on the positions of these characters. The final output is a list `ans` that contains computed values related to the positions of '<' and '>' characters in the string. The string `s1` remains unchanged after the function execution.**
