The code snippet `numCases = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `numCases`. This integer represents the number of test cases, `t`, which was previously described as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\). The values of `n` and `a` (the list of integers) remain unchanged by this code snippet, as they are not referenced or modified in the provided code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `numCases` is an input integer equal to `t`; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.**
