Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the score by always choosing the smallest available numbers to add to the score. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Input Handling:** The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of integers (2n) and the list of integers.
2. **Sorting:** The list of integers is sorted in ascending order (`numbers.sort(reverse=False)`). This ensures that the smallest numbers are considered first.
3. **Pairing and Summing:** The program then pairs the smallest numbers together by popping the first two elements from the sorted list in each iteration of the while loop. It adds the smaller of the two numbers to the score (`suma += min(a, b)`).
4. **Output:** After all pairs are processed, the program prints the total score.

This approach guarantees that the sum of the minimums of all pairs is maximized, as the smallest numbers are always paired together.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description.
