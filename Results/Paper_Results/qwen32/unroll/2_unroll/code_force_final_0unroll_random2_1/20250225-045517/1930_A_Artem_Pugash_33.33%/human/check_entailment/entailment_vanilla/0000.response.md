### Reasoning:
The problem requires us to maximize the score by always selecting the smallest possible pair of numbers at each step and adding the smaller number to the score. The optimal strategy is to sort the numbers in non-decreasing order and then pair them sequentially (first with second, third with fourth, and so on). This way, the smaller numbers are paired with the next smallest numbers, ensuring that the sum of the smaller numbers is maximized.

Let's break down the provided program:
1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the number of integers and the list of integers.
2. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted in ascending order (`numbers.sort(reverse=False)`). This is correct because we want the smallest numbers to be paired together.
3. **Pairing and Summing**: The program uses a `while` loop to repeatedly pop the first two elements from the sorted list, calculates the minimum of the two, adds it to the score, and continues until the list is empty. This correctly implements the strategy of pairing the smallest numbers together.
4. **Output**: After processing each test case, the program prints the resulting score.

The logic and implementation of the program align perfectly with the optimal strategy described in the problem statement.
