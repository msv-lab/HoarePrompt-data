To determine the output state after the loop completes all its iterations, let's break down the loop's behavior and how it modifies the variables.

The loop runs `numCases` times (equal to `t`), and in each iteration:
1. It reads an integer `numInteger` (which is not used further in the loop).
2. It reads a list of `2 * numInteger` integers, splits them, sorts them in ascending order, and stores them in `numbers`.
3. It initializes `suma` to 0.
4. It enters a while loop where it repeatedly pops the first two elements from `numbers`, calculates their minimum, adds it to `suma`, and continues until `numbers` is empty.
5. It prints the final value of `suma`.

Since the loop runs `numCases` times, the output state will consist of `numCases` printed values of `suma` for each iteration.

The state of the variables not directly involved in the loop (like `t`, `numCases`, `n`, `a`) remains unchanged. The state of the variables inside the loop (`numInteger`, `numbers`, `suma`) does not persist across iterations and is reinitialized in each iteration.

Therefore, the output state will be the printed values of `suma` for each of the `numCases` iterations.

Output State: **The printed values of `suma` for each of the `numCases` iterations.**
