You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Problem Description Recap:
Bob sells `n` buns. The first `k` buns are sold at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b-k+1`, and the remaining `n-k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`. We need to find the maximum profit Bob can obtain.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Case when `b <= a`:**
   - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, then it's optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a`.
   - The program correctly handles this case by printing `a * n`.

2. **Case when `b > a`:**
   - The program calculates the optimal `k` as `min(n, b - a)`.
   - The profit from selling the first `k` buns at modified prices is calculated as `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`.
   - The profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a` is `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.

### Checking Edge Cases:
1. **When `n = 1`:**
   - If `b > a`, `k` will be 1, and the profit will be `b`.
   - If `b <= a`, the profit will be `a`.
   - Both cases are correctly handled by the program.

2. **When `b = a`:**
   - The program correctly handles this by selling all buns at the usual price `a`.

3. **When `b - a < n`:**
   - The program correctly calculates `k` as `b - a` and computes the profit accordingly.

4. **When `b - a >= n`:**
   - The program correctly calculates `k` as `n` and computes the profit accordingly.

5. **Large Values:**
   - The program handles large values of `n`, `a`, and `b` correctly due to the use of integer arithmetic.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and checking various edge cases, it appears that the program correctly computes the maximum profit for all potential cases as per the problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program correctly handles all edge cases, including when `b <= a`, `b > a`, and when `b - a` is less than or greater than `n`. It also efficiently computes the profit for large values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
