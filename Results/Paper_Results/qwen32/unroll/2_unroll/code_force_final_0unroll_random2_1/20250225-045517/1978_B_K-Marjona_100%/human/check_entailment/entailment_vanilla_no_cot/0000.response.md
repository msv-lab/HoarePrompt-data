To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's break down its logic and compare it with the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob sells `n` buns. He can choose to sell the first `k` buns at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b-k+1`, and the remaining `n-k` buns at the usual price `a`. The goal is to maximize the profit.

### Program Analysis:
The program follows these steps:
1. For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. It calculates `k` as the minimum of `n` and `b - a + 1`. Note that the program uses `b - a` which is incorrect. It should be `b - a + 1` to correctly compute the number of buns that can be sold at a decreasing price.
3. If `b <= a`, it means the promotion price is not beneficial, so it sells all buns at the usual price `a`.
4. Otherwise, it calculates the profit as the sum of the prices of the first `k` buns sold at the decreasing price plus the price of the remaining `n-k` buns sold at the usual price `a`.

### Issues in the Program:
- The calculation of `k` is incorrect. It should be `k = min(n, b - a + 1)`, not `k = min(n, b - a)`.
- The formula for the sum of the first `k` terms of the decreasing price sequence is correct: `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a + 1)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)

# The rest of the program remains the same.
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the incorrect calculation of `k`. The corrected version should be used to achieve the correct results.
