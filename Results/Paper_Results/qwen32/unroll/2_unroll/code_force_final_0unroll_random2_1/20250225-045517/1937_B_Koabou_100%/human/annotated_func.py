#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5) representing the length of the grid, the second and third lines contain binary strings of length n representing the two rows of the grid. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: `n` is an input integer representing the length of the grid for a test case; `a` is a list containing two elements, which are the results of the two `input()` calls.
    s = []
    x = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1':
            y = i
        
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: `s` is the final concatenated string based on the loop conditions, `x` is the index where the loop broke or `n-1` if it didn't, and `y` is the last index where `a[0][i + 1] == '0'` and `a[1][i] == '1'`.
    t = 1
    for i in range(y, x):
        if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: `s` remains the same, `x` is the index where the loop broke or `n-1` if it didn't, `y` remains the same, `t` is `x - i + 1` if the condition was met, otherwise `t` is 1.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: s (where s is the value of the variable s from the initial state)
    print(t)
    #This is printed: t (where t is x - i + 1 if the condition was met, otherwise t is 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a length `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. For each test case, it computes and prints a modified binary string `s` and an integer `t`. The string `s` is derived based on specific conditions involving the two input strings, and `t` is determined by comparing a substring of the second input string with part of `s`.
