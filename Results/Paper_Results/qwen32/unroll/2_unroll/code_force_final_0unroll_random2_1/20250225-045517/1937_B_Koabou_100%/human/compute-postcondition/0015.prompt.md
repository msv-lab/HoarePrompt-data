You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5) representing the length of the grid, the second and third lines contain binary strings of length n representing the two rows of the grid. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: `n` is an input integer representing the length of the grid for a test case; `a` is a list containing two elements, which are the results of the two `input()` calls.
    s = []
    x = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1':
            y = i
        
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: `s` is the final concatenated string based on the loop conditions, `x` is the index where the loop broke or `n-1` if it didn't, and `y` is the last index where `a[0][i + 1] == '0'` and `a[1][i] == '1'`.
    t = 1
    for i in range(y, x):
        if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: `s` remains the same, `x` is the index where the loop broke or `n-1` if it didn't, `y` remains the same, `t` is `x - i + 1` if the condition was met, otherwise `t` is 1.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: s (where s is the value of the variable s from the initial state)
    print(t)
    #This is printed: t (where t is x - i + 1 if the condition was met, otherwise t is 1)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` representing the length of a grid and two binary strings of length `n` representing the two rows of the grid. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
