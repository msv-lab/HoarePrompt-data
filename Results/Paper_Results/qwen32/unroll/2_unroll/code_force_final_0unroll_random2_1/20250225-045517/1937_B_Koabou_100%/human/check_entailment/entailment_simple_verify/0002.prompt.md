You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code against the problem description step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**:
   - Find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by a path from (1, 1) to (2, n) in a 2xN grid.
   - Count the number of such paths that yield this smallest string.

2. **Constraints**:
   - The grasshopper can only move right or downwards.
   - The input includes multiple test cases.
   - The grid is filled with binary values (0s and 1s).

3. **Logic**:
   - To find the lexicographically smallest string, the grasshopper should prefer moving right if the top cell is '0' and the bottom cell is '1'.
   - If the top cell is '1' and the bottom cell is '0', the grasshopper should move downwards.
   - If both cells are the same, the grasshopper can move in either direction, but the priority should be to keep the string as small as possible.
   - The number of paths that yield the smallest string needs to be counted.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem but contains several logical and implementation errors.

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - It reads the grid as two binary strings.

2. **Path Construction**:
   - The code initializes `s` as an empty list and `x` and `y` as 0.
   - It then iterates through the grid to determine the path.
   - If `a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'`, it sets `y = i`. This logic is correct for identifying a potential point to switch rows.
   - If `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`, it constructs the path `s` and sets `x = i` and breaks the loop. This logic is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the path should continue after this point. It should continue to build the path based on the lexicographical order.
   - If the loop completes without breaking, it sets `s = a[0] + a[1][n - 1]` and `x = n - 1`. This logic is also incorrect because it does not consider the lexicographical order properly.

3. **Path Counting**:
   - The code attempts to count the number of paths that yield the smallest string by checking if the substring of `a[1]` matches the substring of `s`. This logic is incorrect because it does not account for all possible paths correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the lexicographically smallest string and count the number of paths that yield this string. It fails to handle the lexicographical order properly and does not correctly count the number of paths.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
