To determine the output state of the loop, let's analyze the loop step by step.

The loop iterates over the `costs` list, which contains two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`. During each iteration, the loop performs the following operations:
1. It calculates `curr` as the integer division of `n` by the current element `i` in the `costs` list.
2. It adds `curr` to `h`.
3. It subtracts `i * curr` from `n`.

Let's break down the iterations:

**First Iteration (i = n - k + 1):**
- `curr` is calculated as `n // (n - k + 1)`, which is the number of times `n - k + 1` can fit into `n`.
- `h` is incremented by `curr`.
- `n` is reduced by `i * curr`, effectively reducing `n` by the largest possible multiple of `n - k + 1` that is less than or equal to `n`.

**Second Iteration (i = 1):**
- After the first iteration, `n` is reduced to a value that is less than `n - k + 1` (since `n - k + 1` is the largest possible value that was subtracted in the first iteration).
- `curr` is now `n // 1`, which is simply `n`.
- `h` is incremented by `n`.
- `n` is reduced by `1 * n`, which sets `n` to 0.

After the second iteration, the loop ends because there are no more elements in the `costs` list to iterate over. At this point, `n` is 0, and `h` is the sum of the values calculated in each iteration.

Thus, the final state of the variables `n` and `h` is:
- `n` is 0.
- `h` is the sum of the quotients from each division operation performed in the loop.

Output State: **n is 0, h is the sum of the quotients from each division operation performed in the loop.**
