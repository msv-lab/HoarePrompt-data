Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

Initial State:
- `n` is 0.
- `h` is the sum of the quotients from each division operation performed in the loop.
- `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

The Python code snippet is:
```python
print(2)
```

The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the variables `n`, `h`, or `k`. It simply prints the integer `2`.

Thus, the value printed by the `print` statement is `2`.

Output: **2**
