You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Let's analyze why:

1. **Function Call Error**: The function `func_1(n, k)` is called inside the loop, but it is not defined within the scope of the provided code. This will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic used in the function `func_1` does not correctly determine whether Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels with `n` coins using at most 60 stalls. The current implementation only considers two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1`, which is insufficient and incorrect for many cases.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if `n` is very large and `k` is small, or vice versa, the program should be able to determine if it's possible to set up the stalls accordingly.

4. **Output Format**: The output format is incorrect. The program should print "YES" followed by the number of stalls and their prices if it's possible, or "NO" if it's not possible.

To correct the program, we need to ensure that we can set up at most 60 stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One possible approach is to use binary search to find appropriate prices for the stalls. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_buy_exactly_k_jewels(n, k):
    if k > n:
        return "NO"
    
    stalls = []
    remaining_coins = n
    remaining_jewels = k
    
    for i in range(60):
        if remaining_jewels == 0:
            break
        price = remaining_coins // remaining_jewels
        if price == 0:
            break
        num_jewels = remaining_coins // price
        stalls.append(price)
        remaining_coins -= num_jewels * price
        remaining_jewels -= num_jewels
    
    if remaining_jewels == 0:
        return "YES\n{}\n{}".format(len(stalls), " ".join(map(str, stalls)))
    else:
        return "NO"

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(can_buy_exactly_k_jewels(n, k))
```

This corrected version ensures that we can determine if it's possible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels with `n` coins, and it handles the output format correctly.
