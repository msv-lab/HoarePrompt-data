### Reasoning:

The provided program is supposed to determine if Bob can set up his jewelry store with at most 60 stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels with her `n` coins. The program's logic and output do not align with the problem requirements in several ways:

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - If `n == k`, the program correctly prints "YES", "1", "1". This is because if Alice has exactly the same number of coins as the number of jewels she wants to buy, she can buy one jewel for one coin, and the problem is trivially solvable with one stall.
   - If `n < k`, the program correctly prints "NO". This is because Alice does not have enough coins to buy `k` jewels if each jewel costs at least one coin.

2. **General Case (n > k)**:
   - The program calculates a list of costs as `[n - k + 1, 1]` and then tries to determine if the sum of the quotients of `n` divided by each cost is at least `k`.
   - This method does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. The way the costs are chosen and the logic to determine if the sum of quotients meets `k` is flawed. The program should aim to create a sequence of prices such that the cumulative number of jewels Alice can buy equals `k`, and the number of stalls does not exceed 60.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program incorrectly prints "2", "YES", and the list of costs when it should print the number of stalls and the prices for those stalls.
   - The program does not ensure that the number of stalls is at most 60.

### Correctness:

Given the issues outlined above, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
