Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the function summaries to determine the correctness of the given program.

### Problem Breakdown
The task is to count the number of possible arrays `a` of size `n` consisting of only `1` and `-1` such that when the prefix sums of `a` are sorted, they match a given sorted prefix sum array `p`. The result should be given modulo `998,244,353`.

### Solution Explanation
The solution uses dynamic programming (DP) to count the number of ways to achieve each possible prefix sum. Here are the key steps:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `dp` is initialized as an array of size `2 * n + 1` with all elements set to `0`.
   - `offset = n` is used to handle negative prefix sums by shifting them into the positive index range.
   - `dp[offset] = 1` indicates that there is one way to achieve a prefix sum of `0` (the initial state).

2. **DP Transition**:
   - For each element in the array `a` (from `1` to `n`), the algorithm updates the `dp` array.
   - `new_dp` is created to store the number of ways to achieve each prefix sum after considering the current element of `a`.
   - For each possible prefix sum `j` (from `0` to `2 * n`), if there is a way to achieve this sum (`dp[j] > 0`), the algorithm updates `new_dp` for the sums that can be achieved by adding `1` or `-1` to `j`.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the counts do not overflow.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - After processing all elements of `a`, the final prefix sum (which is `p[-1]` in the sorted array) is used to determine the number of ways to achieve this sum.
   - The final sum is adjusted by adding `offset` to handle the shifted index.
   - The result is the value in `dp` at the adjusted final sum index.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The `func_2` function reads input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Correctness Analysis
- **Initialization**: The `dp` array is correctly initialized to handle the initial state of the prefix sum being `0`.
- **DP Transition**: The transition logic correctly accounts for the two possible values of `a` (`1` and `-1`), updating the number of ways to achieve each possible prefix sum.
- **Final Calculation**: The final sum is correctly adjusted by adding `offset` to match the shifted index in the `dp` array.
- **Input Handling**: The input is correctly read and processed for each test case.

### Function Summary Analysis
The function summary for `func_2` states: "The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and for each test case, it calculates and prints a hidden array `a` based on the given sorted prefix sums `p`."

However, this summary is misleading. The function `func_2` does not calculate and print a hidden array `a`. Instead, it calculates the number of possible arrays `a` that can produce the given sorted prefix sum array `p` and prints that number.

### Conclusion
The solution correctly implements the logic to count the number of possible arrays `a` that can produce the given sorted prefix sum array `p`. The function summary for `func_2` is inaccurate, but the core logic of the program is correct.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the analysis of the code.
