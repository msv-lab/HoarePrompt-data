Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the modulo operation correctly in the context of the problem. Specifically, the variable `MOD` is not defined in the code. The problem description specifies that the result should be computed modulo 998,244,353, but the code does not define this constant, leading to a `NameError` if executed as is.

To make the code correct, the `MOD` constant should be defined at the beginning of the program:

```python
MOD = 998244353

# Function 1:
def func_1(n, p):
    dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
    offset = n
    dp[offset] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        new_dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
        for j in range(2 * n + 1):
            if dp[j] > 0:
                if j + 1 <= 2 * n:
                    new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
                if j - 1 >= 0:
                    new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
        dp = new_dp
    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]

# Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(n, p)
        results.append(result)
    for res in results:
        print(res)
```

Additionally, the code should be tested with the provided example cases to ensure it works as expected. However, the primary issue identified here is the missing `MOD` constant definition, which makes the current implementation incorrect.
