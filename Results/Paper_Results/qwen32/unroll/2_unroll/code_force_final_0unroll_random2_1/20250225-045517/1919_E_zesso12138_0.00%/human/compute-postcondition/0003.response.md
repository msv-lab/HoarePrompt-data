`data[index]` is converted to an integer and assigned to the variable `t`. The values of `n`, `p`, `data`, and `index` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of integers of length `n` representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the split input, `index` is 0, and `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of integers of length `n` representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the split input, `index` is 0, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`**.
