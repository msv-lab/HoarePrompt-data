Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to count the number of initial arrays `a` consisting of only `1` and `-1` such that when we compute the prefix sums `p` and sort them, we get the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

### Provided Program Analysis:

#### Function 1: `func_1(n, p)`
- This function uses dynamic programming (DP) to count the number of possible arrays `a` that can result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
- The DP array `dp` is used to store the number of ways to reach each possible prefix sum value. The offset `n` is used to shift the range of possible prefix sums from `[-n, n]` to `[0, 2n]`.
- The DP array is initialized with `dp[offset] = 1`, indicating that there is one way to have a prefix sum of `0` at the start.
- For each element in the array `a`, the DP array is updated to account for the new prefix sums that can be obtained by adding `1` or `-1` to the current prefix sums.
- Finally, the function returns the number of ways to reach the final prefix sum value `p[-1] + offset`.

#### Function 2: `func_2()`
- This function reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results.
- It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the size `n` and the sorted prefix sum array `p`.
- It calls `func_1` for each test case and stores the results.
- Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The DP approach in `func_1` is correct for counting the number of ways to reach each possible prefix sum value. The update of the DP array correctly accounts for the addition of `1` or `-1` to the current prefix sums.
- The final result is obtained by looking up the number of ways to reach the final prefix sum value `p[-1] + offset` in the DP array.
- The function `func_2` correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

### Testing the Program:
Let's verify the program with the provided example inputs.

#### Example Input:
```
5
1
0
1
1
3
-1 1 2
5
-1 0 0 1 1
5
-4 -3 -3 -2 -1
```

#### Expected Output:
```
0
1
0
3
1
```

#### Program Output:
The program should output the expected results for the given example inputs.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution for the problem using dynamic programming. It reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the correct results.

**Correctness: True**
