The provided code snippet only imports the `read` method from `sys.stdin` and assigns it to the variable `input`. This does not modify the values of `n` or `p` in any way. Therefore, `n` remains a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array `a`, and `p` remains a list of integers of length `n` representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array `a`, and `p` is a list of integers of length `n` representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a`.**
