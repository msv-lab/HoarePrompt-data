Correctness: **False**

The given program is not correct for the problem described. Here are the reasons:

1. **Initialization of `dp` array**: The `dp` array is initialized with a size of `2 * n + 1` to account for the possible range of prefix sums which can be from `-n` to `n`. However, the `dp` array is not correctly initialized to handle the prefix sums correctly. The offset is used to shift the range from `-n` to `n` to `0` to `2*n`, but the initial value is set at `dp[offset] = 1`, which correctly represents the starting point of the prefix sum being `0`. However, the logic does not account for the fact that the prefix sums are sorted, and the transitions need to be carefully managed to ensure that the prefix sums can only transition in a way that maintains the sorted order.

2. **Transition Logic**: The transition logic in the `for` loop inside `func_1` does not take into account the sorted nature of the prefix sums. The transitions should ensure that the prefix sums can only move in a way that respects the sorted order of the given `p` array. The current logic simply adds the number of ways to reach the current prefix sum to the number of ways to reach the next prefix sum (either by adding 1 or subtracting 1), without considering the sorted order of `p`.

3. **Final Sum Calculation**: The final sum is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`, which is correct in terms of indexing, but the transitions leading up to this point do not ensure that the prefix sums are in the correct sorted order.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as dynamic programming with memoization or state transitions that respect the sorted order of the prefix sums. The current implementation does not correctly account for these constraints.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
