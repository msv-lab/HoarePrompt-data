The only variable in the loop head is `res`, which iterates over the elements of the `results` list. For the loop to execute, the `results` list must contain at least one element. The other variables (`n`, `p`, `index`, `t`, and `data`) are not directly related to the execution of this specific for loop and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is the size of the array `a` from the last iteration, `p` is the list of prefix sums from the last iteration, `index` is the position after the last prefix sums in `data`, `t` is the number of iterations, and `results` is a list of results from each iteration of `func_1(n, p)` that must have at least one element.**
