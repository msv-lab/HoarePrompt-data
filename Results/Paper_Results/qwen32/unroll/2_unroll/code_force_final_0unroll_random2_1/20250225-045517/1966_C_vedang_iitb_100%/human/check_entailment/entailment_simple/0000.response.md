Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules and optimal play described in the problem statement. The logic in the program attempts to find the "Mex" (minimum excludant) of the pile sizes and use it to determine the winner, but this is not the correct approach for solving the game.

The game described is a variant of the Nim game, specifically a Grundy number-based game. The correct approach to determine the winner is to calculate the XOR (exclusive or) of all pile sizes. If the XOR of all pile sizes is non-zero, Alice (the first player) has a winning strategy. If the XOR is zero, Bob (the second player) has a winning strategy, assuming both play optimally.

The given program incorrectly uses the Mex value and its parity to determine the winner, which does not align with the rules of the game. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
