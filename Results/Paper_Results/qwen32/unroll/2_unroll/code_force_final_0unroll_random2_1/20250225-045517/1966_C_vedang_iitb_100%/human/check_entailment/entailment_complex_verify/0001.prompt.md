You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

    Alice

Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

        else:
            print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')
        
    #State: t is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); no other variables from the loop body are retained.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of piles and the number of stones in each pile. For each test case, it determines the winner of a game based on the smallest non-negative integer not present in the sorted list of stone counts and prints either "Alice" or "Bob" as the winner.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by determining the winner of the game based on the given rules. However, the logic used in the program is incorrect and does not align with the optimal strategy for this game.

The game described is a variant of the Nim game, specifically the Nim game with a twist where players can remove the same number of stones from each non-empty pile. The key to solving this problem is to realize that the game is equivalent to a Nim game where each pile is reduced to its remainder when divided by the minimum pile size. The winner can be determined by calculating the Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes) of the reduced piles.

Let's break down the provided program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of piles and the stones in each pile.
2. It calculates the maximum pile size and sorts the pile sizes.
3. It then calculates the "mexsize" which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the sorted list of pile sizes.
4. Based on the value of mexsize and maxsize, it decides the winner.

This approach is incorrect because:
- The concept of "mexsize" does not align with the rules of the game or the strategy needed to determine the winner.
- The game's outcome is determined by the Nim-sum of the piles, not by the smallest missing non-negative integer in the list of pile sizes.

The correct approach would be:
- For each test case, find the minimum pile size.
- Reduce each pile size by taking the remainder when divided by the minimum pile size.
- Calculate the Nim-sum of the reduced pile sizes.
- If the Nim-sum is zero, Bob wins (he can force a win if both play optimally). Otherwise, Alice wins.

Given the incorrect logic, the provided program does not solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
