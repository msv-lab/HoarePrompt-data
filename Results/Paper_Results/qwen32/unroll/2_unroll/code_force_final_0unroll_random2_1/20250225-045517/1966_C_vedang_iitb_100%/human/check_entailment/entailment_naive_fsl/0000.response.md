Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. The logic in the code seems to be attempting to use the concept of the "Mex" (minimum excludant) from combinatorial game theory, but it is not correctly applied to this specific problem.

The game described is a variant of the Nim game, where the winning strategy can be determined by the bitwise XOR (Nim-sum) of the pile sizes. If the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is zero at the start of a player's turn, that player is in a losing position if both players play optimally. Otherwise, the player is in a winning position.

Let's consider an example to demonstrate why the provided code is incorrect:

**Incorrect Example:**

Input:
```
1
3
1 1 1
```

Expected Output:
```
Bob
```

Explanation of Expected Output: The Nim-sum of the pile sizes is `1 ^ 1 ^ 1 = 1` (non-zero), so Alice can make a move. However, no matter what move Alice makes, she will leave Bob with a Nim-sum of `0` on his turn, which means Bob is in a winning position if he plays optimally.

Actual Output of the Provided Code:
```
Alice
```

The provided code does not correctly compute the Nim-sum and thus does not determine the correct winner for this case. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

To correctly determine the winner, the code should compute the Nim-sum of the pile sizes and determine the winner based on whether the Nim-sum is zero or not. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nim_sum = 0
        for sz in a:
            nim_sum ^= sz
        if nim_sum == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected code correctly computes the Nim-sum and determines the winner based on the problem description.
