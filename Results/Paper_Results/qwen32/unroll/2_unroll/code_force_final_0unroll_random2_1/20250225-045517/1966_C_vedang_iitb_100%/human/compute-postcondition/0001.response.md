In the given task, the for loop iterates over the range of `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The variables `n` (the number of piles) and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (the list of integers for each test case) are mentioned but are not part of the loop head. Therefore, we can only adjust the state related to `t` and `tc` (the loop variable).

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The loop variable `tc` is initialized automatically by the `range(t)` function, so we do not need to set its initial value manually.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1**.
