Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program calculates the sum of the integer divisions by 3 of the counts of each unique integer in the sequence, which does not correspond to the logic needed for the problem. 

The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get if you play optimally, given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. The logic should involve tracking the number of occurrences of each card and simulating the turns based on optimal strategies.

The correct approach would involve:
1. Counting the occurrences of each card.
2. Simulating the turns, taking into account that Nene will play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
3. Calculating the points you can get based on the optimal play.

Given that the provided code does not follow this logic, it will not produce the correct results for the problem.

Correctness: **False**
