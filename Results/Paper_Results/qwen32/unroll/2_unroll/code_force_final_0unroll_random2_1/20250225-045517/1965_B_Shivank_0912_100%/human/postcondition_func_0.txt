The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` where `n` is the size of a set and `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`. It then computes and prints the length of a list `ans` and the elements of `ans` based on the values of `n` and `k`. The list `ans` is constructed such that it contains specific values derived from `k` and powers of 2, excluding the power of 2 corresponding to the highest power less than or equal to `k`. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.
