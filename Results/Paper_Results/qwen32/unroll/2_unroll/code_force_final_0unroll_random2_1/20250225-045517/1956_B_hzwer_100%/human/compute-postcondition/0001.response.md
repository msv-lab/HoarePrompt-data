In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the integer value read from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The state before the loop starts includes the variable `input` which is reassigned to `sys.stdin.readline`. However, the loop head only involves the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`.

Let's break it down:

- The loop will execute `int(input())` times.
- To ensure the loop executes, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 1 (since the problem specifies that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5).

Since the loop head only involves the integer value read from input, we need to ensure that the input provides a valid number of test cases for the loop to execute.

State: **`input` is reassigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, and the first call to `int(input())` must return an integer greater than or equal to 1**.
