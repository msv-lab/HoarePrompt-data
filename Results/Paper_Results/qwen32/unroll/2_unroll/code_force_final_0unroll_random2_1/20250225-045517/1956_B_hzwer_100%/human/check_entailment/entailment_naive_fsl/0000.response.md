Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally. The program simply counts the number of pairs of cards you have and assumes that you can always score a point for each pair, which is incorrect because Nene plays optimally to minimize your score.

Let's analyze why the code is incorrect with an example:

Consider the following test case:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
In this case, the integers written on your cards are 1, 2, and 3. The integers written on Nene's cards are also 1, 2, and 3. If both players play optimally, the game may proceed as follows:

1. You select the card with an integer 1 and place it on the table.
2. Nene selects the card with an integer 1, receives 1 point, and places the selected card on the table.
3. You select the card with an integer 2 and place it on the table.
4. Nene selects the card with an integer 2, receives 1 point, and places the selected card on the table.
5. You select the card with an integer 3 and place it on the table.
6. Nene selects the card with an integer 3, receives 1 point, and places the selected card on the table.

At the end of the game, you scored 0 points, and Nene scored 3 points. The provided program would output `1` for this test case because it counts the number of pairs you have, which is 1 (since you have one pair of each card), but you cannot score any points if Nene plays optimally.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not account for Nene's optimal strategy to minimize your score.
