Let's break down the reasoning step by step to determine if the provided program is correct.

### Problem Understanding:
- We have a deck of 2n cards, with each integer from 1 to n appearing exactly twice.
- Cards are distributed between two players, each receiving n cards.
- Players take turns playing cards, and a player scores a point if the card's number is already on the table.
- Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
- We need to determine the maximum score you can achieve if you also play optimally.

### Strategy:
- Since Nene is playing optimally, she will always try to maximize her score and minimize yours.
- If a card appears twice in your hand, you can score a point on your second play of that card.
- The optimal strategy for you is to play cards such that you maximize the number of times you can play a card that has already been played.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it:
1. Reads the number of cards `n` you have.
2. Reads the list of integers `a` on your cards.
3. Initializes a count array `cnt` of size `n+1` to count occurrences of each integer on your cards.
4. Iterates through the list `a` and increments the count for each integer.
5. Calculates the score by summing `max(0, x - 1)` for each count `x` in `cnt`. This essentially counts the number of pairs of cards you have, as each pair contributes 1 to your score.
6. Prints the calculated score.

### Correctness of the Program:
The program correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can achieve. Hereâ€™s why:
- If a card appears twice in your hand, you can play it twice, scoring 1 point on your second play.
- The formula `max(0, x - 1)` for each count `x` correctly counts the number of pairs, which is the maximum number of points you can score.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can achieve given the constraints and optimal play by Nene.

Correctness: **True**
