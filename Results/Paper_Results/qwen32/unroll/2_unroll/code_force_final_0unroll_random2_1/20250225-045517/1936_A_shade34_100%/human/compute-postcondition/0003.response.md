Functionality: **The function `func()` processes multiple test cases, each involving a hidden permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. For each test case, it interacts with an external system to determine and print the indices `i` and `j` that maximize the bitwise XOR of the elements `p_i` and `p_j` in the permutation. The function uses up to 3n queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of elements in the permutation. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but outputs the required indices for each test case.**
