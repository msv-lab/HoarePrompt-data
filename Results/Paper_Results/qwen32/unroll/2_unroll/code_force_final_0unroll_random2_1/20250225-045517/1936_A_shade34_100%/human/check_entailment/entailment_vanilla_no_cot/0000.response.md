Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the strategy to find the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Query Logic**: The logic used to find `mak` and `mak2` is flawed. The program attempts to find the maximum value in the permutation using bitwise OR (`|`) operations, but this does not necessarily correspond to the indices that will yield the maximum XOR (`⊕`).

2. **Lack of XOR Maximization Strategy**: The program does not implement a strategy to maximize the XOR of two elements. The XOR operation is maximized when the binary representations of the two numbers differ as much as possible. The current approach does not ensure this.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Equal Values**: When the program encounters equal values (`=`) during the queries, it only appends the index to `pans` but does not update the strategy to maximize XOR. This can lead to incorrect results.

4. **Inefficient Use of Queries**: The program uses a number of queries that may exceed the allowed limit of `3n`. The current strategy does not guarantee that it will find the maximum XOR within the allowed number of queries.

To solve this problem correctly, the program should implement a strategy that focuses on maximizing the XOR of two elements by comparing different combinations of indices and using the results of the queries to narrow down the potential candidates. This might involve a more sophisticated approach, such as using a binary search strategy on the bits of the numbers or other heuristics to find the maximum XOR efficiently within the allowed number of queries.
