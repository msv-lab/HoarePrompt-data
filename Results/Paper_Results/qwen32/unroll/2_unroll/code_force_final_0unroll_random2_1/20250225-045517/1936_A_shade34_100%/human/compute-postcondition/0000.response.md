The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use. The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`, which represents the number of test cases `t`. 

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `t` is at least 1, since the loop will iterate `t` times. The state of `_` does not need to be adjusted because it is not used within the loop body.

State: **`t` (number of test cases) must be greater than or equal to 1**
