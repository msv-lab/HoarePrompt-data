Precondition: **The function `func()` does not take any input arguments. It interacts with an external system to receive the number of test cases `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) and for each test case, it receives an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a hidden permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1. The function can ask up to 3n queries in the form "? a b c d" to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of elements in the permutation, and it must output the indices `i` and `j` that maximize the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` in the form "! i j". The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.**
