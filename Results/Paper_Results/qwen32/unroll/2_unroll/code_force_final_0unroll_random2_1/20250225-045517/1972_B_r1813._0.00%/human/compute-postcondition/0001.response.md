The code snippet provided splits the input string into a list of strings using the `split()` method. This means that the input string, which includes the number of test cases, the number of coins for each test case, and the strings representing the coins' orientations, will be broken down into individual components based on whitespace.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, where each string is a component of the original input string split by whitespace.**

In natural language: The `data` variable now holds a list of strings, each representing a part of the original input string separated by spaces.
