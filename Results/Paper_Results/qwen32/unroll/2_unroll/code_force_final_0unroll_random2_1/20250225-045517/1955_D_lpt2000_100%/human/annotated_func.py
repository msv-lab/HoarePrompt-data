#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. b is a list of m integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    #State: The printed values of `fnd` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two lists of integers `a` and `b`, and two integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of times a sliding window of size `m` over list `a` can have at least `k` common elements with list `b`.
