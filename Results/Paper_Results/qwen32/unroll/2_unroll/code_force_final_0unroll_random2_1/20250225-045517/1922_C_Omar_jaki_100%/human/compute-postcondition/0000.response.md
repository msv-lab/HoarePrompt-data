The provided code snippet defines a lambda function `r` that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and maps each split string to an integer. This function `r` is now defined and can be used to read and process input data later in the program. The initial state of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `x_i`, and `y_i` remains unchanged as the lambda function itself does not modify these variables but rather provides a way to read them.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^5, and for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n and x_i != y_i. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. Additionally, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely. `r` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and maps each split string to an integer.**
