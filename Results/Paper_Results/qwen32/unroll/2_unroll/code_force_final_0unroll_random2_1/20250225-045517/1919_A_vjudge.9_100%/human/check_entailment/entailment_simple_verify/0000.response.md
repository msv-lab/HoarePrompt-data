### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the program's logic in detail:

1. **Game Analysis**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns to either swap wallets or keep their current wallets and then remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., cannot remove a coin from a non-empty wallet) loses.

2. **Optimal Play Strategy**:
   - If the number of coins in both wallets is the same (`a == b`), Alice will always lose if both play optimally. This is because whatever move Alice makes, Bob can mirror her move, and Alice will eventually be the one who cannot make a move.
   - If the number of coins is different, the player who starts with more coins can always force a win by maintaining an imbalance in the number of coins in their favor. This is because they can always swap wallets to ensure they are the one to make the last move when the difference is odd.

3. **Parity of the Difference**:
   - The critical insight here is the parity (odd or even nature) of the absolute difference between the number of coins in the two wallets:
     - If `abs(a - b)` is even, Bob wins. This is because Alice cannot force an imbalance that would allow her to win.
     - If `abs(a - b)` is odd, Alice wins. This is because Alice can always force an imbalance that would allow her to win.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The given program correctly implements this logic. It checks the parity of `abs(a - b)`:
     - If `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`, it prints "Bob".
     - Otherwise, it prints "Alice".

### Validation Using Annotations:
- The annotated code confirms that the program iterates over each test case, reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, computes the absolute difference, and prints the winner based on the parity of this difference.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment accurately describes the logic and reasoning behind the program. The program correctly determines the winner based on the optimal play strategy and the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
