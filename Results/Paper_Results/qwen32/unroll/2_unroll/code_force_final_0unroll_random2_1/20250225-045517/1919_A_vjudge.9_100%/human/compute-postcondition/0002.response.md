Output State: **The loop will have printed "Bob" if the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets was even for each test case, and "Alice" if the difference was odd. The variables `a`, `b`, and `i` will have their last iteration values, and `t` will remain unchanged.**
