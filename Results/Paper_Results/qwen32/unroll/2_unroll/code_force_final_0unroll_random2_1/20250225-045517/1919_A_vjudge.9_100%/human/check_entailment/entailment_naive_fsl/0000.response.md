Let's analyze the given program based on the problem description.

The problem states that Alice and Bob take turns in a game where they can either swap wallets or keep their current wallets, and then remove one coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a valid move loses. The task is to determine who will win if both players play optimally.

The given program determines the winner based on whether the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd:
- If `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`, it prints "Bob".
- Otherwise, it prints "Alice".

Let's consider the logic behind the program:

1. **Optimal Play Analysis**:
   - If the number of coins in both wallets is the same (`a == b`), Alice will always lose because whatever move she makes, Bob can mirror her move, and Alice will eventually be the one who cannot make a move.
   - If the number of coins is different, the player who starts with more coins can always force a win by maintaining an imbalance in the number of coins in their favor. This is because they can always swap wallets to ensure they are the one to make the last move when the difference is odd.

2. **Parity of the Difference**:
   - When the difference in the number of coins (`abs(a - b)`) is even, it implies that both players can always mirror each other's moves, leading to Bob's win.
   - When the difference is odd, the first player (Alice) can always make a move that forces the second player (Bob) into a losing position.

Based on this analysis, the given program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic that if the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even, Bob will win; otherwise, Alice will win. This aligns with the optimal play strategy described in the problem statement.
