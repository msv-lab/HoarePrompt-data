### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the initial number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, given that both players play optimally. The key insight is that the parity (even or odd nature) of the absolute difference between the number of coins in the two wallets determines the winner.

- If the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even (`abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`), Bob will win.
- If the absolute difference is odd (`abs(a - b) % 2 != 0`), Alice will win.

The provided program correctly implements this logic. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, calculates the absolute difference, and determines the winner based on the parity of this difference.

The annotations provided describe the state of the program correctly, showing that the program prints "Bob" if the difference is even and "Alice" if the difference is odd. This aligns with the problem's requirements and the original assessment's reasoning.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
