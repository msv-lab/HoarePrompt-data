### Reasoning:

The problem can be analyzed by considering the parity (odd or even nature) of the absolute difference between the number of coins Alice and Bob have. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Game Dynamics**: 
    - Both players take turns, and the game ends when a player cannot make a move (i.e., when both wallets have 0 coins).
    - Since both players play optimally, they will always make a move that leaves their opponent in the worst possible position.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
    - If the number of coins in both wallets is the same, Alice (starting player) will always lose because whatever move she makes, Bob can mirror it, ensuring that Bob always has a move until Alice is forced to make the last move when both wallets are empty.
    - If the number of coins is different, the player with more coins can force the game into a state where the other player is left with an even difference scenario, eventually leading to a win for the player who started with more coins.

3. **Parity Analysis**:
    - If the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even, Alice will eventually be forced into a losing position (where both wallets have the same number of coins), and Bob will win.
    - If the absolute difference is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob with an even difference scenario, ensuring Alice's win.

Given this analysis, the provided program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the absolute difference between `a` and `b` for each test case.
