Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of beautiful pairs. The logic for counting pairs is flawed. Specifically, the program calculates `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x` which is incorrect. The correct approach is to find pairs `(i, j)` such that `a[i] + a[j]` is divisible by `x` and `a[i] - a[j]` is divisible by `y`. This can be transformed into a condition based on the remainders of `a[i]` and `a[j]` when divided by `x` and `y`.

The correct approach would be to use a frequency counter to count occurrences of pairs of remainders `(mod_x, mod_y)` and then check for each number if there exists a previously counted number that forms a beautiful pair with it.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        (n, x, y) = case['params']
        a = case['array']
        freq = {}
        beautiful_count = 0
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = (-mod_x) % x  # Correct calculation of required_mod_x
            required_mod_y = (-mod_y) % y  # Correct calculation of required_mod_y
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)]
            if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
                freq[(mod_x, mod_y)] = 0
            freq[(mod_x, mod_y)] += 1
        results.append(beautiful_count)
    return results
```

In this corrected version, `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` are calculated as `(-mod_x) % x` and `(-mod_y) % y`, respectively, to find the appropriate pairs that satisfy the conditions for being a beautiful pair.
