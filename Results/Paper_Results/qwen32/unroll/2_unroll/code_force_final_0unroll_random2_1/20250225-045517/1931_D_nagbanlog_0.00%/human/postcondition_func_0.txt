The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a list of integers and two additional integers `x` and `y`. For each test case, it calculates and returns the count of "beautiful pairs" in the list. A "beautiful pair" is defined based on the remainders of the elements when divided by `x` and `y`. The function returns a list of counts, one for each test case.
