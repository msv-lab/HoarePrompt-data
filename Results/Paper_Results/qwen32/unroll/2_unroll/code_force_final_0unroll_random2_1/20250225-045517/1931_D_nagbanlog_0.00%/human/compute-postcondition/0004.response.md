Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` representing the length of a list `a`, two integers `x` and `y`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function returns `results`, which is a list of integers where each integer represents the count of beautiful pairs for the corresponding test case.**
