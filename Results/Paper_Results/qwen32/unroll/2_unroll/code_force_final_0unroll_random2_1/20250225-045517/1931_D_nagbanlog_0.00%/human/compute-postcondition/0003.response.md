Output State: **The program returns `results`, which is a list of integers representing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.**

In this output state, `results` contains the count of beautiful pairs for each tuple in the `test_cases` list. Each element in `results` corresponds to a test case, where the count of beautiful pairs is calculated based on the integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list `a` provided in that test case.
