You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

    #State: For each test case, the output will be `! mak2 pans[mak]`, where `mak2` is the value of the maximum element in the permutation, and `pans[mak]` is the smallest index of that maximum element.
#Overall this is what the function does:For each test case, the function identifies the maximum element in a given permutation of the sequence {0, 1, ..., n-1} and outputs the maximum element along with the smallest index at which this maximum element appears.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find a pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized, where \(\oplus\) is the bitwise XOR operation. The program can ask queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of elements in the permutation.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows these steps:

1. **Initialization and First Loop:**
   - It initializes `mak` to 0.
   - For each index `i` from 1 to \(n-1\), it queries the OR comparison between `mak` and `i` (both with themselves).
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `mak` to `i`. This loop essentially finds the index `mak` such that the value `p[mak]` has the maximum number of bits set to 1 (i.e., `p[mak]` is the largest number in terms of bitwise OR with itself).

2. **Second Loop:**
   - It initializes `mak2` to `mak` and an empty list `pans`.
   - For each index `i` from 0 to \(n-1\), it queries the OR comparison between `mak` and `mak2` with `i` and `mak2` respectively.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `mak` to `i` and resets `pans` to `[i]`.
   - If the result is `=`, it appends `i` to `pans`. This loop identifies all indices `i` such that `p[mak] | p[i]` is equal to the maximum found in the first loop.

3. **Third Loop:**
   - It initializes `mak` to 0.
   - For each index `i` in `pans` from 1 to the end, it queries the OR comparison between `pans[mak]` and `pans[mak]` with `pans[i]` and `pans[i]` respectively.
   - If the result is `>`, it updates `mak` to `i`. This loop finds the index in `pans` that has the maximum bitwise OR with itself.

4. **Output:**
   - It prints `! mak2 pans[mak]` which is the pair of indices `(mak2, pans[mak])` that supposedly gives the maximum XOR.

### Flaws in the Program:
- The program is trying to find the maximum XOR by first finding the largest number in terms of bitwise OR with itself and then finding a number that gives the maximum OR with this number. However, this does not guarantee the maximum XOR.
- The XOR operation is maximized when the numbers differ as much as possible in their binary representation. The program does not ensure that the selected numbers differ significantly in their binary representation.
- The third loop is comparing elements within `pans` which are already chosen based on having the same maximum OR with `mak2`. This does not help in finding the maximum XOR.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the pair of indices that maximize the XOR operation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
