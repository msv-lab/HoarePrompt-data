The only object in the loop head is the variable `i` and the iterable `results`. For the loop to execute, `results` must be an iterable (like a list, tuple, set, etc.) that contains at least one element. The variable `i` will take the value of each element in `results` during each iteration of the loop.

Given that, the state before the loop starts must ensure that `results` is an iterable with at least one element. The value of `i` does not need to be specified before the loop starts because it is assigned a value from `results` during each iteration.

So, the adjusted state would be:

State: **`results` is an iterable with at least one element**
