Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of "U" and "D". The function returns the number of times the sequence of coins changes from "U" to "D" or from "D" to "U".**
