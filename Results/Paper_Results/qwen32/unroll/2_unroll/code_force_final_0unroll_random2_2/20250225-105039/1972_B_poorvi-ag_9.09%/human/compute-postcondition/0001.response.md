Output State: **The function receives multiple test cases. For each test case, it is given an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of "U" and "D", where "U" indicates a coin facing up and "D" indicates a coin facing down. `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. `results` is an empty list.**

In natural language: The initial state remains mostly unchanged, except that an empty list named `results` has been created to store the results of the test cases. The variables `n`, `s`, and `t` retain their original meanings and values as described in the initial state.
