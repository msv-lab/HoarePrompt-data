### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by splitting the array into two subsequences `s` and `t` and calculating the penalties for each subsequence. The goal is to minimize the total penalty `p(s) + p(t)`.

However, the provided program does not correctly implement the strategy to achieve the minimum penalty. The logic used in the program seems to try to maintain two elements `a` and `b` and count the number of times an element is greater than both `a` and `b` or less than both `a` and `b`. This approach does not guarantee that the subsequences `s` and `t` are formed in a way that minimizes the total penalty.

The optimal strategy involves finding the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LIS) of the array. The remaining elements can form another subsequence. The penalties for these two subsequences can be calculated as the lengths of the subsequences minus one. However, the provided program does not do this.

Let's analyze the provided program with the given examples:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `5, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - The program might split the array into `[2, 4, 5]` and `[1, 3]` which gives penalties `2` and `1` respectively, summing up to `3`. However, the program's logic might not guarantee this optimal split.

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `8, [8, 2, 3, 1, 1, 7, 4, 3]`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - The program might split the array into `[8, 3, 1]` and `[2, 1, 7, 4, 3]` which gives penalties `0` and `1` respectively, summing up to `1`. However, the program's logic might not guarantee this optimal split.

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `5, [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - The program might split the array into `[]` and `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]` which gives penalties `0` and `0` respectively, summing up to `0`. However, the program's logic might not guarantee this optimal split.

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `1, [1]`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - The program might split the array into `[]` and `[1]` which gives penalties `0` and `0` respectively, summing up to `0`. However, the program's logic might not guarantee this optimal split.

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - Input: `2, [2, 1]`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - The program might split the array into `[]` and `[2, 1]` which gives penalties `0` and `0` respectively, summing up to `0`. However, the program's logic might not guarantee this optimal split.

Given the provided logic, it seems that the program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy to minimize the total penalty. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Correctness: **False**
