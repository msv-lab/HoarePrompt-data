Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a count `c` that represents the number of elements in the array that satisfy specific conditions related to being greater than or less than two reference values `a` and `b`.**
