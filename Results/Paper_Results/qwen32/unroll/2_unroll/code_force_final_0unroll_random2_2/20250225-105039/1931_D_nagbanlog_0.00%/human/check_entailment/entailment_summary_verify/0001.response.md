### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the core logic of the program and the issue with the unnecessary print statements. However, the core logic itself is actually flawed. Let's delve deeper into the logic to understand why:

1. **Initialization and Frequency Dictionary**:
   - The program initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` to keep track of the number of occurrences of each pair \((a_i \% x, a_i \% y)\).

2. **Processing Each Number**:
   - For each number `num` in the array `a`, it calculates `mod_x` as `num % x` and `mod_y` as `num % y`.
   - It calculates `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x`. This is correct for the condition \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\), which implies \(a_j \equiv -a_i \pmod{x}\) or equivalently \(a_j \equiv (x - a_i \% x) \% x \pmod{x}\).
   - `required_mod_y` is set to `mod_y` because for the condition \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\), we need \(a_j \equiv a_i \pmod{y}\).

3. **Updating Beautiful Count**:
   - If the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is already in `freq`, it adds the frequency of this pair to `beautiful_count`. This step is correct.
   - It then updates the frequency of the pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` in `freq`.

### Issue with the Logic:
The issue arises when the program updates the frequency dictionary after checking for beautiful pairs. Specifically, the order of operations means that each number is counted against itself, which is not allowed since \(i < j\).

For example, consider the array `[1, 2]` with \(x = 5\) and \(y = 2\):
- For `num = 1`, `mod_x = 1` and `mod_y = 1`. The required pair is `(4, 1)`. Since `(4, 1)` is not in `freq`, `beautiful_count` remains 0.
- The pair `(1, 1)` is added to `freq`.
- For `num = 2`, `mod_x = 2` and `mod_y = 0`. The required pair is `(3, 0)`. Since `(3, 0)` is not in `freq`, `beautiful_count` remains 0.
- The pair `(2, 0)` is added to `freq`.

The problem is that the program does not ensure that \(i < j\). If we update the frequency dictionary before checking for beautiful pairs, we might count pairs where \(i = j\), which is not valid.

### Correct Approach:
To fix this, we should update the frequency dictionary after checking for beautiful pairs to avoid counting pairs where \(i = j\).

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        (n, x, y) = case['params']
        a = case['array']
        freq = {}
        beautiful_count = 0
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
            required_mod_y = mod_y
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
            if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
                freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
        results.append(beautiful_count)
    return results
```

However, the original code's logic is flawed due to the order of operations. The correct order should be:
1. Check for beautiful pairs.
2. Update the frequency dictionary.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the flawed logic in the original code, the correct assessment should be that the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
