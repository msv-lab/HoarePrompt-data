The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, two integers `x` and `y`, and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and returns the count of "beautiful pairs" in the list, where a "beautiful pair" is defined based on specific modulo conditions involving `x` and `y`. The function returns a list of these counts, one for each test case.
