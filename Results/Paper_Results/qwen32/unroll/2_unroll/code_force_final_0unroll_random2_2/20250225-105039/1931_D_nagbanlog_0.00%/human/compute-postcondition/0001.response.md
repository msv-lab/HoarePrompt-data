To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `case` and `test_cases`.

The loop iterates over `test_cases`, so for the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one element. The state of `t` (the number of test cases) does not directly affect the execution of the loop, as the loop itself only checks if there are elements in `test_cases`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. This indicates the number of test cases, but it doesn't directly influence the loop execution.
2. `test_cases` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
3. `case` is a variable that will take on the value of each element in `test_cases` during each iteration of the loop.

Given this, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `test_cases` contains at least one element. The initial state of `results` being an empty list does not affect the loop's execution directly, but it should remain as is since it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `test_cases` is not empty.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list with at least one element where each element is a tuple (n, x, y, a_list) with the specified constraints, `results` is an empty list**.
