### Reasoning:

The provided function `func_1` aims to determine the number of beautiful pairs in an array for each test case. A pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if:

1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The function iterates over each test case and uses a dictionary (`freq`) to track the frequency of pairs of remainders \((\text{mod}_x, \text{mod}_y)\) for each element in the array. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: For each test case, initialize a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of each pair of remainders \((\text{mod}_x, \text{mod}_y)\) and a counter `beautiful_count` to count the number of beautiful pairs.

2. **Processing Each Number**: For each number in the array, compute:
   - `mod_x` as `num % x` (the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`).
   - `mod_y` as `num % y` (the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`).
   - `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x` (the remainder that, when added to `mod_x`, results in a multiple of `x`).
   - `required_mod_y` as `mod_y` (the same remainder for subtraction).

3. **Checking for Beautiful Pairs**: If the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in `freq`, it means there are numbers previously encountered in the array that can form a beautiful pair with the current number. Increment `beautiful_count` by the frequency of this pair.

4. **Updating Frequency Dictionary**: Update the frequency dictionary with the current pair \((\text{mod}_x, \text{mod}_y)\).

5. **Result Collection**: After processing all numbers in the array, append the `beautiful_count` for the current test case to the `results` list.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the function with the first test case from the problem statement:

- **Input**: `n = 6`, `x = 5`, `y = 2`, `a = [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6]`
- **Processing**:
  - For `1`: `mod_x = 1`, `mod_y = 1`, `required_mod_x = 4`, `required_mod_y = 1`
  - For `2`: `mod_x = 2`, `mod_y = 0`, `required_mod_x = 3`, `required_mod_y = 0`
  - For `7`: `mod_x = 2`, `mod_y = 1`, `required_mod_x = 3`, `required_mod_y = 1`
  - For `4`: `mod_x = 4`, `mod_y = 0`, `required_mod_x = 1`, `required_mod_y = 0` -> Found pair `(1, 0)` (from `1`), `beautiful_count = 1`
  - For `9`: `mod_x = 4`, `mod_y = 1`, `required_mod_x = 1`, `required_mod_y = 1` -> Found pair `(1, 1)` (from `1`), `beautiful_count = 2`
  - For `6`: `mod_x = 1`, `mod_y = 0`, `required_mod_x = 4`, `required_mod_y = 0` -> Found pair `(4, 0)` (from `4`), `beautiful_count = 3`
- **Output**: `beautiful_count = 2` (which matches the expected output)

### Conclusion:

The function correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs for each test case. The implementation is efficient and handles the constraints provided in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
