### Reasoning:
The program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program first reads the number of test cases (`numCases`). For each test case, it reads the number of integers (`numInteger`), which is `2n`, and then reads the `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting**: The integers are sorted in non-decreasing order (`numbers.sort(reverse=False)`). Sorting helps in pairing the smallest numbers together, which is optimal to maximize the sum of the minimums.

3. **Pairing and Summing**: The program then enters a loop where it repeatedly pops the first two elements from the sorted list (which are the smallest available numbers at each step), calculates their minimum, adds it to the score (`suma`), and continues until all numbers have been paired and removed from the list.

4. **Output**: For each test case, the program prints the final score after all the moves have been performed.

The strategy of sorting the numbers and always pairing the smallest available numbers ensures that the sum of the minimums is maximized, as required by the problem statement. The program correctly handles multiple test cases and performs the necessary operations to achieve the optimal solution.
