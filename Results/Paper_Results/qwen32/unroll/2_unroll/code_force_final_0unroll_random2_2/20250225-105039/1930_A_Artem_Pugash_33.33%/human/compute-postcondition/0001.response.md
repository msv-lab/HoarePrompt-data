The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `numCases`. For the loop to execute, `numCases` must be at least 1 because the loop will iterate from `0` to `numCases - 1`. The variable `i` is the loop counter and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts; it will be initialized by the `range` function.

Given the task, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `numCases` is greater than or equal to 1. 

State: **`numCases` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1**
