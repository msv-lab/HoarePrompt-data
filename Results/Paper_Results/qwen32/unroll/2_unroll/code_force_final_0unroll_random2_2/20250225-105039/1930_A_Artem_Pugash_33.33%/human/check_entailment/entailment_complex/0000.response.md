### Reasoning:

The given Python program aims to solve the problem by following these steps:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - It first reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number `n` which indicates there are `2n` integers on the whiteboard.
   - It then reads the `2n` integers and stores them in a list.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The list of integers is sorted in non-decreasing order.

3. **Pairing and Summing:**
   - The program pairs the integers in the sorted list by taking the smallest available integer, then the next smallest, and so on.
   - It calculates the score by adding the minimum of each pair to the total score.

4. **Output:**
   - The final score for each test case is printed.

### Analysis:

- **Sorting:** Sorting the list in non-decreasing order ensures that when we pair the numbers, the smallest numbers are paired together. This strategy maximizes the score because the sum of the minimums of the pairs is maximized when the smallest numbers are paired.
  
- **Pairing:** By popping the first two elements from the sorted list in each iteration, the program effectively pairs the smallest available numbers together, ensuring that the sum of the minimums is maximized.

- **Correctness:** Given the problem's requirement to maximize the score by summing the minimums of `n` pairs, the approach of sorting the list and pairing the smallest numbers together is correct. The program correctly implements this approach for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
