In the provided loop, the only object in the loop head is the variable `ii`, which iterates over the range generated by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input to the `range()` function must be a positive integer. This input comes from converting the input to an integer, so the input must represent a positive integer.

Given the state before the loop starts includes `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` (a list of integers), none of these variables directly influence the execution of the loop. Only the input that determines the range for `ii` matters.

To ensure the loop executes, the input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer. Since `t` is described as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, it can be used as the input to the loop to ensure the loop executes `t` times.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that the input to the loop is `t`, ensuring the loop will execute `t` times.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, and the input to the loop is `t`**
