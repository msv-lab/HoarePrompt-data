The loop iterates over the string `num` from the last character to the first. It increments `tot` for each trailing '0' found in `num`. The loop stops as soon as a non-'0' character is encountered. 

In simpler terms, `tot` ends up being the count of trailing zeros in `num`.

Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer greater than or equal to 0; `tot` is the count of trailing zeros in `num`.**
