To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to carefully analyze whether the logic implemented in the functions `func_1` and `zerocnts` correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Breakdown:

1. **Anna's Turn:**
   - Anna reverses the digits of a chosen number, removing leading zeros.
   - This operation does not change the total number of digits in the list.

2. **Sasha's Turn:**
   - Sasha concatenates two numbers in the list.
   - This operation reduces the total number of elements in the list by one.

3. **Winning Condition:**
   - Sasha wins if the final number is at least \(10^m\).
   - Anna wins if the final number is less than \(10^m\).

### Key Observations:

- **Total Digits:**
  - The total number of digits in the list remains constant throughout Anna's turns.
  - Sasha's turns reduce the number of elements but do not change the total number of digits.

- **Sasha's Strategy:**
  - Sasha always concatenates two numbers.
  - The final number's length is the total number of digits in the list.
  - Sasha wins if the total number of digits is at least \(m+1\).

- **Anna's Strategy:**
  - Anna can only reverse numbers, which does not affect the total number of digits.

### Program Analysis:

- **Function `zerocnts(num)`:**
  - This function counts the number of trailing zeros in a number.
  - It is used to determine how many digits can be removed by Anna's reversal.

- **Function `func_1(n, m, nums)`:**
  - It calculates the total number of digits in all numbers.
  - It calculates the number of trailing zeros for each number and sorts them in descending order.
  - It subtracts the trailing zeros from the total digits in pairs (since Anna can only remove trailing zeros in her turns).
  - It checks if the remaining total number of digits is at least \(m+1\).

### Correctness:

The logic in the program is flawed. The program incorrectly assumes that removing trailing zeros (which Anna can do) will directly affect the winning condition. However, the key point is the total number of digits, not the number of trailing zeros.

- **Error in Logic:**
  - The program incorrectly subtracts the trailing zeros in pairs, which does not accurately reflect the game's mechanics.
  - The total number of digits should be compared directly to \(m+1\) without considering the removal of trailing zeros.

### Correct Approach:

- **Total Number of Digits:**
  - The total number of digits in the list should be compared directly to \(m+1\).
  - If the total number of digits is at least \(m+1\), Sasha wins.
  - Otherwise, Anna wins.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner based on the total number of digits.

**Correctness: False**
