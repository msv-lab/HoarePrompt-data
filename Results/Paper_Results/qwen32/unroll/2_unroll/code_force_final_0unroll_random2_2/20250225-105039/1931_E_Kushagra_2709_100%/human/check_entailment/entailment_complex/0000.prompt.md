Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

# Annotated Functions:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, m, nums))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of integers in the list, m is an integer representing the parameter determining when Sasha wins, nums is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
def func_1(n, m, nums):
    tot = sum(len(val) for val in map(str, nums))
    cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)

        tot -= cntvals[i]
        
    #State: `n` is an integer representing the number of integers in the list, `m` is an integer representing the parameter determining when Sasha wins, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `tot` is the sum of the number of digits in all integers in `nums` minus the sum of every second element in `cntvals` starting from the first, `cntvals` is a sorted list of the number of zeros in the binary representation of each integer in `nums` in descending order.
    return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'
    #The program returns 'Sasha' if the sum of the number of digits in all integers in `nums` minus the sum of every second element in `cntvals` starting from the first is greater than or equal to `m + 1`; otherwise, it returns 'Anna'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines the winner of a game between Sasha and Anna based on the sum of the number of digits in a list of integers (`nums`), adjusted by subtracting the sum of every second element in a list of zero counts in the binary representations of those integers. The function returns 'Sasha' if the adjusted sum is greater than or equal to `m + 1`; otherwise, it returns 'Anna'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer greater than or equal to 0.
def zerocnts(num):
    num = str(num)
    tot = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] != '0':
            break
        
        tot += 1
        
    #State: `num` is a string representation of an integer greater than or equal to 0; `tot` is the count of trailing zeros in `num`.
    return tot
    #The program returns `tot`, which is the count of trailing zeros in the string representation of the integer `num`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `num` that is greater than or equal to 0 and returns the count of trailing zeros in its string representation.
