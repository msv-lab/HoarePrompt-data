Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is min(n, b)**

In natural language: The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` remain integers within the range 1 to 10^9. The variable `low` is set to 0, and the variable `high` is set to the minimum value between `n` and `b`.
