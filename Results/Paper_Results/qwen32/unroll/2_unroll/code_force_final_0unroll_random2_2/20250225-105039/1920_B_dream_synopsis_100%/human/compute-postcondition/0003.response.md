Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum possible sum after performing specific operations involving the elements of `a` and the values of `k` and `x`.**
