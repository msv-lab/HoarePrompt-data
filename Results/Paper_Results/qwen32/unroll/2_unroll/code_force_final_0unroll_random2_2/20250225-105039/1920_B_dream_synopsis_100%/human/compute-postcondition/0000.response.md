In the provided code snippet, the for loop iterates over the range of an integer `t`, which is the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
