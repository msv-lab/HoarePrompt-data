You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ m ≤ 5), where n is the number of problems in the bank and m is the number of upcoming rounds. This is followed by a string a of length n, consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = input()
        
        ans = 0
        
        p = 'ABCDEF'
        
        hmp = Counter(s)
        
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
        
        for i in hmp:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: a series of integers, each representing the result of one test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a set of problems with specified difficulties and a number of upcoming rounds. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of additional problems needed to ensure that each difficulty level ('A' to 'F') is represented in at least the specified number of rounds.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in how it calculates the number of additional problems needed. Specifically, it does not correctly account for the requirement that each round should contain one problem of each difficulty level 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'. The program only considers difficulties 'A' to 'F' and does not handle 'G'. Additionally, it does not correctly handle cases where the number of problems of a particular difficulty is already sufficient for `m` rounds.

Here's a specific test case that demonstrates the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
7 1
ABCDEFG
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

Explanation of the issue:
- The input string "ABCDEFG" contains one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
- Since `m=1`, Vlad only needs one problem of each difficulty level, which he already has.
- However, the program incorrectly calculates that he needs one more problem because it does not consider 'G' in the set of required difficulties.

Another test case to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
6 2
ABCDEF
```

**Expected Output:**
```
7
```

**Actual Output:**
```
6
```

Explanation of the issue:
- The input string "ABCDEF" contains one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'F'.
- Since `m=2`, Vlad needs two problems of each difficulty level, which he does not have.
- The program incorrectly calculates that he needs six more problems because it does not consider 'G', but it should actually need seven more problems (one 'G' and one more of each 'A' to 'F').

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to these logical errors.
