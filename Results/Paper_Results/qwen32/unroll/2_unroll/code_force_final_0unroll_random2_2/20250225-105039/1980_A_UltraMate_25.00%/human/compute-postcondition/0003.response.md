Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`, where `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) is the number of problems in the bank and `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 5) is the number of upcoming rounds. It also accepts a string `a` of length `n` that consists of characters from 'A' to 'G', representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank. The function returns a result based on the given inputs, which is not detailed here but is implied to be related to the distribution or selection of problems for the rounds.**
