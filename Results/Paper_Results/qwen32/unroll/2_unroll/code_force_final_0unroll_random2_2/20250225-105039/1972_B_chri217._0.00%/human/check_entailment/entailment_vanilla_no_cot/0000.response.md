Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the number of facing-up coins. The key insight is that Alice wins if and only if the number of facing-up coins is odd. This is because each move reduces the number of facing-up coins by one, and the player who faces a situation with an even number of facing-up coins will eventually lose if the opponent plays optimally. The program correctly implements this logic by counting the number of 'U's in the string and checking if that count is odd or even.
