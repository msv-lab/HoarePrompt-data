The code snippet provided only reads an integer value from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 5000. After executing the code, the value of `t` will be updated to whatever integer is provided by the input, but the constraints on `t` remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= floor(n/2). a is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.**
