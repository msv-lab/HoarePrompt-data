Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing half the length of the list `a`, an integer `k` such that 1 <= k <= floor(n/2), and a list `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice. The function returns a value or values based on the input parameters for each test case.**
