The only variable in the loop head is `q`, which is the loop variable iterating over the range `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Given that the state before the loop starts is `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, the loop will execute as long as `t` is within this range. The values of `n`, `k`, and `a` do not affect whether the loop will execute or not, as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state does not need any adjustment for the loop to execute. The loop will execute as long as `t` is within the given range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000**
