The code snippet `M += [w]` appends the value of `w` to the list `M`. Since `M` was initially an empty list, after executing this code, `M` will contain one element, which is the value of `w`. The other variables, `q` and `w`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` (1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9), and `q` contains between 1 and 100 such tuples; `M` is a list containing the integer `w`; `w` is an integer such that `w == w // 1` and `w >= x - 1`.**
