Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` (1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9), and `q` contains between 1 and 100 such tuples; `M` is an empty list; a TypeError will be raised. Additionally, `w` is an integer such that `w == w // 1` and `w >= x - 1`.**

In simpler terms: The list `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples, each with two integers `n` and `x` where `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`. The list `M` is empty, and a TypeError will be raised. The variable `w` is an integer that satisfies the conditions `w == w // 1` (which means `w` is an integer) and `w >= x - 1`.
