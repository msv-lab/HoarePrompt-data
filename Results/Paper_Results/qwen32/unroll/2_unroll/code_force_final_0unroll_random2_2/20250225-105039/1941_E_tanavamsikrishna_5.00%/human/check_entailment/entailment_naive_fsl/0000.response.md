Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the minimum total cost of installing supports for the bridges. Let's break down the issues:

### Issues in `func_1`:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the cost for a single row by adding 1 to each cell and then trying to find the minimum cost for placing supports with the constraint on distance `d`. However, it does not correctly handle the placement of supports with the required distance constraint. The logic for placing supports with distance `d` is flawed. The function does not ensure that the supports are placed such that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
   - Specifically, the logic `row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1` does not correctly account for the distance constraint. It simply adds the minimum of the previous `d` cells plus 1 to the current cell, which does not guarantee that the supports will be placed with the required distance.

### Issues in `func_2`:
2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation for Multiple Rows**:
   - The function `func_2` calculates the cost for each row independently using `func_1` and then sums the costs for `k` consecutive rows to find the minimum total cost. However, since `func_1` does not correctly calculate the cost for a single row, the total cost for `k` consecutive rows will also be incorrect.
   - The function does not consider the interaction between the rows when calculating the total cost. For example, placing supports in a certain way in one row might affect the optimal placement of supports in the next row.

### Example to Demonstrate the Issue:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3 5 2 2
0 1 2 1 0
0 2 3 2 0
0 1 2 1 0
```
The correct output should be `8` because the optimal placement of supports would be:
- Row 1: Supports at positions 1, 3, 5 (cost = 0 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 4)
- Row 2: Supports at positions 1, 3, 5 (cost = 0 + 3 + 0 + 2 = 5)
- Row 3: Supports at positions 1, 3, 5 (cost = 0 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 4)

The total cost for rows 1 and 2 would be `4 + 4 = 8`.

However, the provided program will not produce this result because `func_1` does not correctly calculate the cost for a single row with the required constraints.

### Conclusion:
Since the provided program does not correctly handle the placement of supports with the required distance constraint and does not correctly calculate the total cost for `k` consecutive rows, it is incorrect.
