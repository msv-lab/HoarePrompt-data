To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):`. The variables involved here are `i`, `costs`, and `k`.

Let's analyze the loop condition: `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. For the loop to execute, the value of `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than 0. This means `len(costs)` must be greater than or equal to `k`.

Given that `costs` is a list where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`, and `rows` is a 2D list with `n` sublists (rows), the length of `costs` is equal to `n`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute:
- `n` (the number of rows in `rows`) must be greater than or equal to `k`.
- `k` must be a positive integer.

The variable `i` is the loop index and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts, as it is initialized automatically by the `range` function.

The variables `m`, `d`, `rows`, and `total_costs` are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

So, the adjusted state should ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to `k` and `k` is a positive integer.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `m`, `d`, `rows`, and `total_costs` remain unchanged**
