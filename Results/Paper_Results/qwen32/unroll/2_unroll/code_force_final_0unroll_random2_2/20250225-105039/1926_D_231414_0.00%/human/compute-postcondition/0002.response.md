In the provided for loop, the loop head contains only the variable `_` and the variable `times`. The variable `_` is a conventional throwaway variable used in Python when the loop variable is not needed within the loop body. The loop will execute based on the value of `times`.

To ensure that the loop executes, the variable `times` must be greater than 0. The variable `t` and `check` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `times` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `times` must be greater than 0, `check` is 2147483647**
