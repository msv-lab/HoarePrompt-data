### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the program's logic. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen over `k` excursions.
   - Each pair of friends has a friendship value `f` that increases by 1 each time the pair is chosen.
   - The expected value must consider the probability of each pair being chosen, which is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The provided program calculates the sum of friendship values for each pair over `k` excursions without considering the probability of each pair being chosen.
   - The formula `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2)` calculates the total increase in friendship value for a pair over `k` excursions if it were chosen every time, which is incorrect.

3. **Correct Calculation**:
   - The expected increase in friendship value for a specific pair over `k` excursions should be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Expected Increase} = f \cdot \left( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \cdot \left( 1 + 2 + \ldots + k \right) \right)
     \]
     Simplifying, this becomes:
     \[
     \text{Expected Increase} = f \cdot \left( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \cdot \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \right)
     \]
   - The expected value for all pairs is the sum of the expected increases for each pair.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The program correctly applies the modulo operation, but the logic for calculating the expected value is incorrect.

5. **Example**:
   - For `n = 3`, `m = 1`, `k = 2`, and a friendship pair `(1, 2, 1)`, the correct expected value should be:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = 1 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \cdot \left( 1 + 2 \right) \right) = 1 \cdot \left( \frac{3}{3} \right) = 1
     \]
   - The provided code would incorrectly calculate it as:
     \[
     \text{Incorrect Calculation} = 1 \cdot \left( 2 \cdot 3 // 2 \right) = 3
     \]

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values according to the problem description. The issue lies in the incorrect calculation of the expected value for each friendship pair. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**.
