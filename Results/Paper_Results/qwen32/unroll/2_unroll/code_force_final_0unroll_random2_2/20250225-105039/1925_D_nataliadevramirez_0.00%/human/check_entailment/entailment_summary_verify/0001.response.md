### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Recap

1. **Objective**: Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions, and return the result as \( p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) \).

2. **Key Points**:
   - There are \( n \) children and \( m \) pairs of friends.
   - Each friend pair has an initial friendship value.
   - For each of the \( k \) excursions, a pair of children is chosen randomly.
   - If the chosen pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all chosen pairs.

3. **Mathematical Insight**:
   - The probability of choosing a specific friend pair in one excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \), where \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).
   - The expected number of times a specific friend pair is chosen in \( k \) excursions is \( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - The expected contribution of a friend pair to the total sum is the sum of the expected values of its friendship value over the \( k \) excursions.
   - If a pair is chosen \( x \) times, its total contribution is \( f + (1 + 2 + \ldots + x) \), where \( f \) is the initial friendship value.
   - The expected total contribution of a pair with initial value \( f \) is \( f \cdot k + \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

4. **Simplification**:
   - The problem simplifies to calculating the sum of the expected contributions of all friend pairs.
   - The expected contribution of a single friend pair can be calculated as \( f \cdot k + \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - Since the problem asks for the result modulo \( 10^9+7 \), we need to handle the division carefully by using modular inverses.

#### Program Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the expected contribution of all friend pairs.
   - It sums up \( f \cdot \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \) for all friend pairs.
   - The term \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \) is calculated once and used for all friend pairs.
   - The result is taken modulo \( 10^9+7 \).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the result.

#### Issues in the Program

1. **Missing Modular Inverse**:
   - The program does not account for the division by \( \binom{n}{2} \) in the expected value calculation.
   - The correct expected contribution of a friend pair should be \( f \cdot k + \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - The term \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \) needs to be calculated using the modular inverse of \( \binom{n}{2} \) modulo \( 10^9+7 \).

2. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The program incorrectly calculates the expected value by not including the division by \( \binom{n}{2} \).

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the division by \( \binom{n}{2} \) in the expected value calculation.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
