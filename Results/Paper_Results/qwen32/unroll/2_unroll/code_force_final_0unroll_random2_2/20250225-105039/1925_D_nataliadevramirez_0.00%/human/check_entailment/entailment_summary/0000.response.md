### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided functions to see if they correctly solve the problem.

#### Problem Breakdown:
- **Objective**: Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions, and return the result in the form of `p * q^-1 % (10^9+7)`.
- **Given**:
  - `n`: Number of children.
  - `m`: Number of pairs of friends.
  - `k`: Number of excursions.
  - `friendships`: List of pairs of friends and their initial friendship values.
- **Output**: For each test case, print one integer, which is the answer to the problem.

#### Analysis of Provided Functions:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: To calculate the sum of the product of each friendship value and the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, and return this sum modulo `MOD`.
   - **Implementation**:
     - The sum of the first `k` natural numbers is calculated using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
     - For each friendship `(a, b, f)`, the result is incremented by `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`.
     - The final result is returned modulo `MOD`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: To handle multiple test cases, read inputs, and call `func_1` to compute the result for each test case.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, reads `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of friendships.
     - Calls `func_1` with these values and prints the result.

#### Correctness Check:

- **Sum of First `k` Natural Numbers**: The formula `k * (k + 1) // 2` is used to calculate the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is correct.
- **Expected Value Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the expected value by summing the product of each friendship value and the sum of the first `k` natural numbers. This is mathematically correct for the problem's objective.
- **Modulo Operation**: All operations are performed modulo `10^9+7`, which is necessary to ensure the result fits within the problem's constraints and to match the required output format.
- **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: Function `func_2` correctly reads multiple test cases and processes each one using `func_1`.

Given the above analysis, the provided functions correctly implement the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
