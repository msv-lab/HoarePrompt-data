n is an integer representing the number of children, m is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends, k is an integer representing the number of excursions, and friendships is a list of lists where each sublist contains three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i representing a pair of friends and their friendship value. It is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5, 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^5, a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9.
