The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variables `start`, `end`, and `results` are not directly related to the execution of the loop itself but are part of the program state. However, since we can only adjust the objects in the loop head, we will focus on `i` and `t`.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized by the `range` function, so we don't need to set it before the loop starts.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` must be greater than 0; `results` is an empty list**
