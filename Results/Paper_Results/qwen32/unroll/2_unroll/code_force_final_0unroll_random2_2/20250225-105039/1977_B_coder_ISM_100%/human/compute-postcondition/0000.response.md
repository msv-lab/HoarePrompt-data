The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). After executing the code, the value of `t` will be whatever integer is input by the user, but it will still satisfy the condition \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). No other variables are affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**.
