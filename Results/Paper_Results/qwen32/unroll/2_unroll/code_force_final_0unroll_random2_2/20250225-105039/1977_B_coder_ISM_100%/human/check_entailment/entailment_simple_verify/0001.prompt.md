You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1
    6
    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation**: The program initializes an empty list `s` and a variable `length` set to 30. It then iterates over the range from 0 to 29 and checks if the `i`-th bit of `x` is set (i.e., `x & pow(2, i)` is true). If the bit is set, it appends '1' to the list `s`; otherwise, it appends '0'. This effectively creates a binary representation of `x` in reverse order (least significant bit first).

3. **Adjusting the Array**:
   - The program then iterates through the list `s` from index 0 to 28. It uses a flag variable to ensure that no two consecutive elements in the list `s` are non-zero.
   - If the flag is set and the current element is '0', it changes the current element to '1' and resets the flag.
   - If the flag is not set and the current and next elements are both '1', it changes the current element to '-1' and sets the flag.
   - If the flag is set, it changes the current element to '0'.
   - This process ensures that no two consecutive elements are non-zero.
   - After the loop, if the flag is set and the last element is '0', it changes the last element to '1'. If the flag is set and the last element is not '0', it changes the last element to '0' and appends '1' to the list, increasing the length by 1.
   - Finally, it iterates through the list `s` from index 1 to `length - 1` and adjusts the array if there are any consecutive '1' and '-1' elements by swapping them.

4. **Output**: For each test case, the program prints the length of the array and the elements of the array.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Binary Representation**: The initial binary representation is created in reverse order, which is fine, but the adjustments made to ensure no two consecutive elements are non-zero are incorrect.
- **Adjusting the Array**: The logic to adjust the array is flawed. The program does not correctly handle the conditions specified in the problem statement. For example, it does not correctly handle cases where the binary representation has multiple consecutive '1's or where the adjustments lead to incorrect values.
- **Appending '1'**: The logic to append '1' at the end if the flag is set and the last element is not '0' is incorrect. This can lead to an incorrect array representation.
- **Swapping '1' and '-1'**: The final loop to swap '1' and '-1' is unnecessary and does not fix the issues in the array.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for adjusting the array to meet the problem's constraints is flawed, and the final output may not satisfy the conditions given in the problem statement.
