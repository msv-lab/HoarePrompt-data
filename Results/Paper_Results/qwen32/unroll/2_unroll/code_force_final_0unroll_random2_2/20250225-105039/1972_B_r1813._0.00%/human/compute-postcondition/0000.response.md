The provided code snippet only reads the entire input from standard input and assigns it to the variable `input`. However, it does not process or modify any other variables or perform any operations based on the read input. Therefore, the state of the program remains largely unchanged except for the new variable `input` that holds the entire input string.

Output State: **The function `func_1` does not take any direct input parameters. However, it is expected to read input from standard input where the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of "U" and "D", representing the state of each coin (facing up or down). `input` is assigned the entire input string from standard input.**
