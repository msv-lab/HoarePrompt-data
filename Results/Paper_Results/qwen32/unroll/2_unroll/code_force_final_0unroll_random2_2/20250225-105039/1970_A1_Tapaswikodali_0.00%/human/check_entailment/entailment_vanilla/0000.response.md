Reasoning:
1. **Prefix Balance Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the prefix balance for each character in the input string. It maintains a `balance` variable that is incremented for each "(" and decremented for each ")".

2. **Storing Details**: For each character, the program stores a tuple in the `details` list. This tuple contains the prefix balance, the negative of the position (to ensure that ties in balance are broken by decreasing position), and the character itself.

3. **Sorting**: The `details` list is sorted. The sorting is done primarily by the prefix balance (ascending order) and secondarily by the negative position (descending order, due to the negative sign, which effectively sorts by position in descending order when balances are the same).

4. **Result Construction**: After sorting, the program constructs the result string by extracting the characters from the sorted `details` list and joining them.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the resulting balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It accurately calculates the prefix balances, sorts the characters according to the specified criteria, and constructs the output sequence.

Correctness: **True**
