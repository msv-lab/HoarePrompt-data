Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the requirement to form regular polygons with the given sticks. The function `func_1` only considers forming squares (polygons with 4 sides) by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 4. However, the problem statement allows for regular polygons with any number of sides (triangles, squares, pentagons, etc.).

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Expected Output:**
```
1
```
**Explanation of Expected Output:**
We can form a regular pentagon with 5 sticks of length 1.

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
0
```
**Explanation of Actual Output:**
The function `func_1` divides the frequency of each stick length by 4, which results in 0 for 5 sticks of length 1, since 5 // 4 = 1 but the function does not account for forming a pentagon.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it only considers forming squares and does not account for other regular polygons.
