Correctness: **False**

The given program incorrectly calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed. The function `func_1` only considers the number of squares (polygons with 4 sides) that can be formed, as it divides the frequency of each stick length by 4. However, the problem requires finding the maximum number of regular polygons with any number of sides, not just squares.

To solve the problem correctly, you need to consider all possible regular polygons with 3 or more sides that can be formed with the given sticks. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def max_polygons(arr):
    from collections import Counter
    freq = Counter(arr)
    polygons = 0
    for length, count in freq.items():
        for sides in range(3, count + 1):
            if count // sides > 0:
                polygons += count // sides
                count %= sides
                break
    return polygons

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(max_polygons(arr))
```

This version of the program considers all possible polygons with 3 or more sides that can be formed with the given sticks, and it calculates the maximum number of such polygons.
