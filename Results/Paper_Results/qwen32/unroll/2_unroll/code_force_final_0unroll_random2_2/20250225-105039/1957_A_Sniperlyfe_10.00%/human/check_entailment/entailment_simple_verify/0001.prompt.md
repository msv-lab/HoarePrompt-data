You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 4 for v in freq.values()))



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the list contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the stick lengths.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the list contains an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing the stick lengths; `freq` is a dictionary with keys as the integers from `arr` and values as the counts of how many times each integer appears in `arr`.
    return sum(v // 4 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the dictionary `freq` by 4.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed using the given sticks. A regular polygon requires all sides to be of equal length, and each stick can be used in only one polygon. The minimum number of sides for a polygon is 3 (a triangle). However, the program seems to be specifically considering polygons with at least 4 sides (as it divides the frequency of each stick length by 4).

### Program Analysis
The provided program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the maximum number of polygons that can be formed using the sticks of the same length. It does this by:
1. Creating a frequency dictionary `freq` that counts the occurrences of each stick length.
2. Calculating the number of polygons that can be formed from sticks of each length by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 4 (integer division) and summing these values.

Let's break down the example cases given in the problem statement:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `1`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: A single stick cannot form any polygon (minimum 3 sticks required for a triangle).

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `1 1`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: Two sticks cannot form any polygon (minimum 3 sticks required for a triangle).

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `2 2 3 3 3 3`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: The program correctly identifies that 4 sticks of length 3 can form a square (a polygon with 4 sides).

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4`
   - Output: `2`
   - Explanation: The program correctly identifies that 4 sticks of length 2 can form a square, and 4 sticks of length 4 can form another square.

### Issues with the Program
The main issue with the provided program is that it assumes that only polygons with 4 sides (squares) can be formed. However, the problem statement does not impose this restriction and allows for polygons with any number of sides (minimum 3). Therefore, the program does not account for the possibility of forming polygons with more than 4 sides.

### Correctness
Given the above analysis, the program is not entirely correct as it does not consider polygons with more than 4 sides. It only considers squares.

Correctness: **False**
