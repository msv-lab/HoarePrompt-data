The provided Python code snippet initializes an empty dictionary named `freq`. This dictionary is intended to store frequencies or counts of some values, but the code snippet does not perform any operations that would modify the list `arr` or the values associated with the test cases.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the list contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100) representing the stick lengths; `freq` is an empty dictionary.**
