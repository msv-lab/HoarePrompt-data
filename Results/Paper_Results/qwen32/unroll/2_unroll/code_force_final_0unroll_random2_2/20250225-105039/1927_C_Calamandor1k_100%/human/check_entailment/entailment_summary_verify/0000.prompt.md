You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given an array a of n integers, an array b of m integers, and an even number k
.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly \frac{k}{2}
elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every
integer from 1 to k is included.

For example:

  * If a=[2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 4, 10, 5] , k=6 , then it is possible to choose elements with values 2, 3, 6 from array a and elements with values 1, 4, 5 from array b . In this case, all numbers from 1 to k=6 will be included among the chosen elements.
  * If a=[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 8, 10, 3] , k=6 , then it is not possible to choose elements in the required way. 

Note that you are not required to find a way to choose the elements — your
program should only check whether it is possible to choose the elements in the
required way.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n, m \le 2\cdot10^5 , 2 \le k \le 2 \cdot \min(n, m) , k is even) — the length
of array a , the length of array b , and the number of elements to be chosen,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_j \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test
does not exceed 4 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to choose \frac{k}{2} numbers from
each array in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1
to k is included. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Output

    YES

    YES

Note

In the first test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 2 , 3 , and 6 from array a and elements equal to 1 , 4 , and 5 from array b
. Thus, all numbers from 1 to k=6 are included among the chosen elements.

In the second test case of the example, it can be shown that it is not
possible to choose exactly three elements from each array in the required way.

In the third test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 1 and 3 from array a and elements equal to 2 and 4 from array b . Thus, all
numbers from 1 to k=4 are included among the chosen elements.

- Program:
t = int(input())
cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cases.append((n, m, k, a, b))
results = func_1(t, cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, cases):
    results = []
    for (n, m, k, a, b) in cases:
        unique_a = set(a)
        unique_b = set(b)
        relevant_a = {x for x in unique_a if x <= k}
        relevant_b = {x for x in unique_b if x <= k}
        only_a = relevant_a - relevant_b
        only_b = relevant_b - relevant_a
        both = relevant_a & relevant_b
        if len(only_a) > k // 2:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        if len(only_b) > k // 2:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        total_distinct = len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)
        if total_distinct < k:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        results.append('YES')
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list `cases` containing `t` tuples. Each tuple consists of integers `n`, `m`, `k`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a list `b` of `m` integers. It evaluates each test case based on specific conditions and returns a list `results` containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case. The function does not modify the input parameters `t` or `cases`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the requirement that exactly \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements must be chosen from each array \(a\) and \(b\), and that all integers from 1 to \(k\) must be included among the chosen elements.

Let's analyze the logic in the code with a counterexample:

Consider the following test case:

```
1
5 5 6
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
```

In this case:
- \(n = 5\), \(m = 5\), \(k = 6\)
- \(a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\)
- \(b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\)

The code will:
1. Create sets of unique elements from \(a\) and \(b\) that are less than or equal to \(k\).
2. Determine the elements that are unique to each set and the common elements.
3. Check if the number of unique elements in each set and their intersection is sufficient to cover all numbers from 1 to \(k\).

Here's the breakdown:
- `unique_a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
- `unique_b = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
- `relevant_a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
- `relevant_b = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
- `only_a = set()`
- `only_b = set()`
- `both = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`

The code then checks:
- `len(only_a) > k // 2` → `0 > 3` → `False`
- `len(only_b) > k // 2` → `0 > 3` → `False`
- `total_distinct = len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)` → `0 + 0 + 5 = 5`
- `total_distinct < k` → `5 < 6` → `False`

Since `total_distinct < k` is `False`, the code will append `'YES'` to the results.

However, this is incorrect because we need to choose exactly 3 elements from each array such that all numbers from 1 to 6 are included. Since there are only 5 numbers in both arrays combined, it is impossible to choose 3 elements from each array that cover all numbers from 1 to 6.

Thus, the code does not correctly handle this scenario, and the Correctness is **False**.
