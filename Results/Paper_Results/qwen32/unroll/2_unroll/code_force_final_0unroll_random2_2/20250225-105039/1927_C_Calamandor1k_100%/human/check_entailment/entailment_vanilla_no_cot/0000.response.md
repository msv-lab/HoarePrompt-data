Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to choose exactly \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from both arrays such that every integer from 1 to \(k\) is included among the chosen elements.

Here are the key issues with the program:

1. **Handling of Elements in Both Arrays**: The program considers elements that are in both arrays (`both`) but does not correctly account for how many of these elements can be used. The program only checks if the total number of distinct elements (considering `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`) is at least \(k\). However, it does not ensure that we can choose exactly \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from each array.

2. **Checking the Number of Elements from Each Array**: The program needs to ensure that we can choose exactly \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from `only_a` and `only_b` combined with `both`. The current logic does not guarantee this.

Here is a corrected version of the logic:

- We need to check if we can choose \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from `only_a` and `only_b` combined with `both` such that we have exactly \(\frac{k}{2}\) from each array.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(t, cases):
    results = []
    for (n, m, k, a, b) in cases:
        unique_a = set(a)
        unique_b = set(b)
        relevant_a = {x for x in unique_a if x <= k}
        relevant_b = {x for x in unique_b if x <= k}
        only_a = relevant_a - relevant_b
        only_b = relevant_b - relevant_a
        both = relevant_a & relevant_b
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of elements we can take from only_a and only_b
        max_from_a = min(len(only_a), k // 2)
        max_from_b = min(len(only_b), k // 2)
        
        # Calculate the remaining elements needed from both
        remaining_from_both = k // 2 - max_from_a
        if remaining_from_both < 0:
            remaining_from_both = 0
        remaining_from_both_b = k // 2 - max_from_b
        if remaining_from_both_b < 0:
            remaining_from_both_b = 0
        
        # Check if we can satisfy the condition
        if (max_from_a + min(len(both), remaining_from_both) >= k // 2 and
            max_from_b + min(len(both) - min(len(both), remaining_from_both), remaining_from_both_b) >= k // 2):
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    return results
```

This corrected version ensures that we can choose exactly \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from each array by considering the elements that are unique to each array and the elements that are common to both arrays.
