You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: primary_items is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the price for Alice and the price for Bob respectively. secondary_heap is a list of tuples with the same structure as primary_items, representing items that have been added to a heap.
def func_3(primary_items, secondary_heap):
    total = sum(item[0] for item in secondary_heap)
    for item in primary_items:
        if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
            total += item[0] + item[1]
        
    #State: `primary_items` remains the same, `secondary_heap` remains the same, `total` is the sum of its initial value and the sum of `item[0] + item[1]` for all `item` in `primary_items` where `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`.
    return total
    #The program returns the sum of the initial value of `total` and the sum of `item[0] + item[1]` for all `item` in `primary_items` where `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `primary_items`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the price for Alice and the price for Bob respectively, and `secondary_heap`, a list of tuples with the same structure as `primary_items`. The function returns the sum of the initial value of `total` (which is not specified but implied to be 0) and the sum of `item[0] + item[1]` for all `item` in `primary_items` where `item[0] + item[1]` is greater than or equal to 0.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the sum of the initial value of `total` and the sum of `item[0] + item[1]` for all `item` in `primary_items` where `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
