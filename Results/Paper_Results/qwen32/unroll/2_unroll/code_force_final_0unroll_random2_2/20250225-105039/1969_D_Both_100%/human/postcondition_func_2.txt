The function calculates and returns the sum of the initial value of `total` (which is the sum of the first elements of the tuples in `secondary_heap`) and the sum of the sums of the elements in each tuple from `primary_items` where the sum of the elements in the tuple is greater than or equal to zero. The input lists `primary_items` and `secondary_heap` remain unchanged.
