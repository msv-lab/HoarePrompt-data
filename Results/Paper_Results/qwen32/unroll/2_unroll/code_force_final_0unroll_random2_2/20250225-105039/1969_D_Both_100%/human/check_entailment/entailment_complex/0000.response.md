### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided code and ensure it aligns with the problem description:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` reads an integer, which is the number of test cases.
   - The function `func_2` reads a line of input, splits it by whitespace, and returns a map object containing integers. This is used to read `n`, `k`, the list of prices for Alice (`a_i`), and the list of prices for Bob (`b_i`).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes a heap and a list of remaining items.
   - It reads `n` and `k`, then reads the lists `prices` (Alice's prices) and `bonuses` (Bob's prices).
   - It converts `prices` to `neg_prices` by negating each value, which is useful for a max-heap implementation using Python's `heapq` (which is a min-heap by default).

3. **Combining and Sorting Items:**
   - It combines `neg_prices` and `bonuses` into a list of tuples `combined` and sorts this list by the bonus values (`b_i`).

4. **Initial Selection:**
   - It pushes the first `k` items from the sorted list into the heap. This represents the items Alice initially buys, which Bob can take for free.

5. **Calculating Initial Profit:**
   - If there are any items left in `combined` after the initial `k`, it calculates the initial profit using `func_3`. This function sums up the initial value of `total` (sum of the first elements of the tuples in `secondary_heap`) and the sum of the sums of the elements in each tuple from `primary_items` where the sum of the elements in the tuple is greater than or equal to zero.

6. **Iterative Profit Calculation:**
   - The program then iterates over the remaining items in `combined`. For each item:
     - It adjusts the `current_profit` based on whether the item's sum of prices is non-negative.
     - It pushes the item into the heap and pops the smallest item (highest negative price, i.e., lowest positive price) from the heap.
     - It adjusts the `current_profit` again based on the popped item.
     - It updates `max_profit` if `current_profit` exceeds it.

7. **Output:**
   - After processing all items for a test case, it prints the `max_profit`.

### Correctness:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to maximize Alice's profit while considering Bob's optimal strategy. It uses a heap to efficiently manage the items and their prices, ensuring that the solution is optimal.

**Correctness: **True**
