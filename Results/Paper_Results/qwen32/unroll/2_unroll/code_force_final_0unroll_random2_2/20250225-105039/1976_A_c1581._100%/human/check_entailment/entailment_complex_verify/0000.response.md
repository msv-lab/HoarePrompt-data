Reasoning: 
The original assessment is correct in identifying a flaw in the provided program. The function `func_1` does not explicitly check the condition that "there should be no digit that comes after a letter." Instead, it checks if the digits and letters are sorted individually and then compares the sorted string with the original password. This approach does not ensure that no digit appears after a letter in the original password.

Let's analyze this with the counterexample provided:

**Input:**
```
1
5
a1b2c3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation of the Counterexample:**
In the password "a1b2c3", the digit '1' comes after the letter 'a', the digit '2' comes after the letter 'b', and the digit '3' comes after the letter 'c'. This violates the condition that no digit should come after a letter. However, the function `func_1` would return `True` for this input because the digits and letters are individually sorted.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function only checks if the digits and letters are sorted and then compares the concatenated sorted string with the original password, which does not address the specific requirement that no digit should come after a letter.

To correctly handle the condition, the function should iterate through the password and ensure that once a letter is encountered, no digit should follow it. Here is the corrected version of the function as suggested in the original assessment:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    digit_encountered = False
    
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            if digit_encountered:
                return False
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            digit_encountered = True
            letters.append(char)
    
    if digits != sorted(digits) or letters != sorted(letters):
        return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected function first checks if a digit appears after a letter and then checks if the digits and letters are sorted.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the given program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
