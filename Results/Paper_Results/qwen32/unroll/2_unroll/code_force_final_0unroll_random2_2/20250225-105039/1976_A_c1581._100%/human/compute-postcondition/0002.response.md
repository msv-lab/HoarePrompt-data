The only object in the loop head is the variable `char`, which iterates over the `password` string. To ensure that the loop executes, the `password` string must have at least one character. Since the problem statement already specifies that `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters where `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`, the `password` string already meets the requirement to execute the loop.

The variables `digits` and `letters` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. They are initialized as empty lists and can remain so.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`, `digits` is an empty list, `letters` is an empty list**
