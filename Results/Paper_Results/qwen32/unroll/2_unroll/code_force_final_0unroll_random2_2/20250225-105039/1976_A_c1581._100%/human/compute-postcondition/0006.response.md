The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the range is determined by `len(digits)`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `len(digits)` must be at least 1. This means the list `digits` must contain at least one digit character.

Here are the necessary adjustments:
- `digits` must contain at least one digit character.
- `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts, but it should be understood that it will start at 0 when the loop begins.

Since `password` is given and `digits` is derived from `password`, we need to ensure that `password` contains at least one digit character to guarantee that `digits` will have at least one element.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and `password` must contain at least one digit; `digits` is a list containing all the digit characters from the password in sorted order and must have at least one digit; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the password in sorted order; `i` is the loop variable**
