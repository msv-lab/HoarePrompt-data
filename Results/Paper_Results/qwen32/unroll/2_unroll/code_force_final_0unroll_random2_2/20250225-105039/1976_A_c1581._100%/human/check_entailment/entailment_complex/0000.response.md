### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to ensure that the function `func_1` correctly verifies whether a password satisfies all the conditions mentioned in the problem statement. Let's break down the function step-by-step and check if it meets the requirements:

1. **Separation of Characters:**
   - The function separates the characters in the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`. This is done correctly by iterating through each character in the password and appending it to the appropriate list based on whether it is a digit or a letter.

2. **Sorting:**
   - Both `digits` and `letters` lists are sorted in non-decreasing order. This is done correctly using the `sort()` method.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The function then checks two conditions:
     - It ensures that the digits are in non-decreasing order. This is implicitly checked by sorting the list.
     - It ensures that no digit comes after a letter in the original password. This is checked by comparing each digit with each letter. Specifically, it checks if the last digit is less than or equal to each letter. However, this logic is flawed. It should ensure that there are no letters after any digit in the original password, not just compare the last digit with each letter. The correct approach would be to ensure that there are no letters after the first digit encountered in the password.
   - The function then constructs a `sortedPassword` string by concatenating the sorted `digits` and `letters` lists.
   - Finally, it checks if `sortedPassword` is equal to the original `password`. If they are equal, it means the original password was already sorted in the required manner, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Flaw in the Logic:
- The condition `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:` is incorrect for checking if a digit comes after a letter. It only checks the last digit against all letters, which is insufficient. The correct approach would be to ensure that all letters appear after all digits in the original password.

### Correctness:
Given the flaw in the logic for checking if a digit comes after a letter, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
