### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the provided program. The function `func_1` does not explicitly check the condition that "there should be no digit that comes after a letter." Instead, it only checks if the digits and letters are sorted individually and then compares the concatenated sorted string with the original password. This approach can lead to incorrect results, as demonstrated by the counterexample provided in the original assessment.

Let's analyze the annotated code to further validate this:

1. **Splitting Characters into Digits and Letters:**
   - The code correctly splits the password into `digits` and `letters` lists.
   - **State:** `digits` contains all digit characters, and `letters` contains all letter characters from the password.

2. **Sorting Digits and Letters:**
   - Both `digits` and `letters` are sorted individually.
   - **State:** `digits` and `letters` are now sorted lists.

3. **Checking Sorted Order:**
   - The code checks if any digit is greater than the next digit in the `digits` list.
   - It then checks if the last digit in the `digits` list is greater than any letter in the `letters` list.
   - **State:** These checks ensure that the `digits` and `letters` lists are sorted, but they do not ensure that no digit appears after a letter in the original password.

4. **Comparing Sorted Password with Original Password:**
   - The code concatenates the sorted `digits` and `letters` lists and compares the result with the original password.
   - **State:** This comparison ensures that the characters are sorted, but it does not enforce the condition that no digit should appear after a letter in the original sequence.

### Counterexample Analysis:

For the input `a1b2c3`:
- The `digits` list would be `['1', '2', '3']` and the `letters` list would be `['a', 'b', 'c']`.
- Both lists are already sorted.
- The concatenated sorted string would be `'123abc'`, which is not equal to the original password `'a1b2c3'`.
- However, the code does not check the critical condition that no digit should appear after a letter in the original password.

### Correct Approach:

The original assessment suggests a more appropriate approach:
- Iterate through the password and ensure that once a letter is encountered, no digit should follow it.
- Additionally, check if the digits and letters are sorted.

Here is the corrected function based on the original assessment:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    digit_encountered = False
    
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            if digit_encountered:
                return False
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            digit_encountered = True
            letters.append(char)
    
    if digits != sorted(digits) or letters != sorted(letters):
        return False
    
    return True
```

### Final Evaluation:

Given the analysis and the counterexample, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly verify the password conditions, particularly the condition that no digit should come after a letter.

**Final: **False**
