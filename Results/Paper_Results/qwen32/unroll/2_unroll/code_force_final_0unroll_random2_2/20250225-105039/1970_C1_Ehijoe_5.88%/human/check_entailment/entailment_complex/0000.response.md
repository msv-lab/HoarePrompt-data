### Reasoning:

The problem involves a game on a tree with exactly two leaves, which can be represented as a linear path (array). The game starts with a stone on a given node, and players take turns moving the stone to an adjacent node until no valid moves are left. Ron starts first, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

The key observation here is that the game outcome depends on the distance of the starting node from the two leaves of the tree. Since the tree is essentially a path, we can determine the winning strategy based on the parity (odd or even) of the minimum distance from the starting node to either of the leaves.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of nodes `n`, the number of rounds `t` (which is always 1), the edges of the tree, and the starting node.
2. **Tree Representation**: The program constructs a deque representing the path from one leaf to the other.
3. **Index Calculation**: It finds the index of the starting node in this deque.
4. **Distance Calculation**: It calculates the minimum distance from the starting node to either end of the deque (which represent the two leaves).
5. **Winning Condition**: If either of these distances is odd, Ron wins because he can force a win by making the first move. If both distances are even, Hermione wins because Ron will always be forced into a losing position.

The provided program correctly implements this logic. It accurately constructs the path, calculates the distances, and determines the winner based on the parity of these distances.
