### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem of placing `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons on the minimum number of 5x3 screens. Let's break down the logic used in the program and verify it against the problem requirements.

#### Key Points:
1. **Grid Size**: Each screen is 5x3, which means it has a total of 15 cells.
2. **Icon Types**:
   - 1x1 icons occupy one cell.
   - 2x2 icons occupy four cells.
3. **Constraints**:
   - The goal is to minimize the number of screens.
   - Each cell can be occupied by only one icon.

#### Program Logic:
- **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0**:
  - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`: This calculates the minimum number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, two 2x2 icons can fit on one screen (8 cells), hence the division by 2 and ceiling.
  - `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`: This line is incorrect and does not make sense in the context of the problem. It seems to be trying to adjust the remaining `x` after placing 2x2 icons, but the logic is flawed.
  - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)`: This calculates the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
  - `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)`: This sums up the screens needed for both types of icons.
  
- **Case 2: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0**:
  - `print(math.ceil(y / 2))`: This is correct as it directly calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons.
  
- **Case 3: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0**:
  - `print(math.ceil(x / 15))`: This is correct as it calculates the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons.
  
- **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0**:
  - `print(0)`: This is correct as no screens are needed.

#### Issues in the Program:
- The line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. It incorrectly adjusts the `x` value, leading to incorrect calculations.
- The logic for placing 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons needs to be re-evaluated. The program should consider the remaining space on the screens after placing 2x2 icons.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the program, especially the incorrect adjustment of `x` after placing 2x2 icons, the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of screens in all cases.

**Correctness: False**

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the program, one should correctly calculate the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons and then determine how many 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining space. Here's a corrected version of the logic for Case 1:

```python
def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        screens_for_2x2 = math.ceil(y / 2)
        remaining_cells = 15 * screens_for_2x2 - 4 * y
        screens_for_1x1 = math.ceil((x - remaining_cells) / 15) if x > remaining_cells else 0
        print(screens_for_2x2 + screens_for_1x1)
```

This corrected version ensures that the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons is considered when placing 1x1 icons.
