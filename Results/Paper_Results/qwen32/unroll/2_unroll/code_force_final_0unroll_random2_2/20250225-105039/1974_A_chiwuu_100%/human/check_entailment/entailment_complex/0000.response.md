Let's analyze the provided program and its logic step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons on a 5x3 grid.
- Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which can accommodate:
  - 15 1x1 icons (5 rows * 3 columns)
  - 4 2x2 icons (since each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and a 5x3 grid can fit 4 non-overlapping 2x2 icons)
- We need to find the minimum number of screens required to fit all icons.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads `n`, the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `a` (number of 1x1 icons) and `b` (number of 2x2 icons).

2. **Calculating Minimum Screens**:
   - The variable `t` is initialized to `b` (number of 2x2 icons).
   - If `t` is even, it is divided by 2. If `t` is odd, it is divided by 2 and then incremented by 1. This step calculates the minimum number of screens required to fit the 2x2 icons, considering that each screen can fit at most 4 2x2 icons.
   - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. This represents the remaining capacity of the screens calculated so far in terms of 1x1 icons.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, it means the current number of screens (`t`) is sufficient to fit all icons. Otherwise, additional screens are needed to fit the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - If additional screens are needed, the program calculates `t2` as the number of remaining 1x1 icons after filling the screens with 2x2 icons. It then calculates how many additional screens are needed to fit these remaining 1x1 icons.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The logic appears to be correct based on the problem description, but let's verify it with one of the examples provided:

**Example 1:**
- Input: `1 1`
- Calculation:
  - `t = 1` (since `b = 1`)
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11` (remaining capacity for 1x1 icons after placing 1 2x2 icon)
  - Since `t1 (11) >= a (1)`, `t` remains 1. This means 1 screen is sufficient to fit 1 2x2 icon and 1 1x1 icon.

**Example 2:**
- Input: `7 2`
- Calculation:
  - `t = 2` (since `b = 2`)
  - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 22` (remaining capacity for 1x1 icons after placing 2 2x2 icons)
  - Since `t1 (22) >= a (7)`, `t` remains 2. This means 2 screens are sufficient to fit 2 2x2 icons and 7 1x1 icons.

The program seems to handle the provided examples correctly. However, a more rigorous test suite should be run to ensure correctness for all edge cases, such as when `x` and `y` are at their maximum values (99).

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program appears to correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required for all given test cases.

**Correctness: True**
