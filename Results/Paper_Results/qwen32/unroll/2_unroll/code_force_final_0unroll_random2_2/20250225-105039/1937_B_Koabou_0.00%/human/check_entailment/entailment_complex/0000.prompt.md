Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is
\mathtt{11000} . There is only one path that yields this string:

# Annotated Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of columns in the grid, followed by two binary strings of length n representing the top and bottom rows of the grid, respectively. The function will be called multiple times with different test cases, and the sum of n across all test cases will not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: `n` is an input integer representing the number of columns in the grid, `a` is a list containing two binary strings of length `n` representing the top and bottom rows of the grid.
    s = []
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: `s` is either `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]` where `i` is the index where the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` is met, or `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]` if no such `i` is found; `x` is either the index `i` where the condition is met or `n - 1` if no such `i` is found.
    t = 1
    for i in range(x):
        if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: s is either a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:] where i is the index where the condition a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0' is met, or a[0] + a[1][n - 1] if no such i is found; x is either the index i where the condition is met or n - 1 if no such i is found; t is either 1 or x - i + 1 where the loop breaks.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: s (where s is constructed based on the conditions provided: either a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:] if an index i meets the condition a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0', or a[0] + a[1][n - 1] if no such i is found)
    print(t)
    #This is printed: 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n` representing the top and bottom rows of a grid. It then constructs and prints a new binary string `s` based on specific conditions related to the input strings. Additionally, it prints an integer `t` which is either 1 or a calculated value based on the constructed string `s`.
