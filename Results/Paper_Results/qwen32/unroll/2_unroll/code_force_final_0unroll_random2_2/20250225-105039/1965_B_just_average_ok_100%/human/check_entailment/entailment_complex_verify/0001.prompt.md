You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1

    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1

    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(21)]
        idx = -1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)

    #State: For each test case, the length of the modified `nums` list followed by the elements of the modified `nums` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it constructs a list of specific values based on `k` and outputs the length of this list followed by the list's elements.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find a sequence `a` of non-negative integers with the following properties:
1. There is no subsequence of `a` that sums to `k`.
2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

### Program Analysis:
The program generates a sequence `nums` based on the following logic:
1. It starts with a list of powers of 2 up to `2^20` (which is 1,048,576, more than enough to cover the range of `n` up to `10^6`).
2. It then finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` and removes it.
3. It adds three specific numbers to the list: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
4. It prints the length of the list and the list itself.

### Verifying the Program Logic:
1. **Exclusion of `k`**:
   - The program removes the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and adds `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - The key here is to ensure that no combination of these numbers can sum to `k`.

2. **Inclusion of all other sums**:
   - The initial list of powers of 2 can generate all numbers that are sums of distinct powers of 2, up to `2^21 - 1`.
   - By adding `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, the program ensures that all sums up to `n` (except `k`) can be formed.
   - `k - nums[idx]` ensures that numbers just below `k` can be formed.
   - `k + 1` ensures that numbers just above `k` can be formed.
   - `k + nums[idx] + 1` ensures that numbers slightly larger than `k` can be formed, which helps in forming larger sums up to `n`.

### Testing the Program:
Let's consider the example test cases provided:

1. **Test Case 1: `n = 2`, `k = 2`**
   - The sequence will be `[1, 2 - 1, 2 + 1, 2 + 1 + 1]` which simplifies to `[1, 1, 3, 4]`.
   - We can form sums 1 and 3, but not 2.
   - Correct.

2. **Test Case 2: `n = 6`, `k = 1`**
   - The sequence will be the powers of 2 up to 2^20, but the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 1 is removed, and 0, 2, and 3 are added.
   - This ensures that no sum equals 1, but all other sums up to 6 can be formed.
   - Correct.

3. **Test Case 3: `n = 8`, `k = 8`**
   - The sequence will be the powers of 2 up to 2^20, but the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 8 is removed, and 0, 9, and 10 are added.
   - This ensures that no sum equals 8, but all other sums up to 8 can be formed.
   - Correct.

4. **Test Case 4: `n = 9`, `k = 3`**
   - The sequence will be the powers of 2 up to 2^20, but the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 3 is removed, and 0, 4, and 5 are added.
   - This ensures that no sum equals 3, but all other sums up to 9 can be formed.
   - Correct.

5. **Test Case 5: `n = 10`, `k = 7`**
   - The sequence will be the powers of 2 up to 2^20, but the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 7 is removed, and 0, 8, and 9 are added.
   - This ensures that no sum equals 7, but all other sums up to 10 can be formed.
   - Correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided program seems to correctly generate sequences that satisfy the conditions for all given test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
