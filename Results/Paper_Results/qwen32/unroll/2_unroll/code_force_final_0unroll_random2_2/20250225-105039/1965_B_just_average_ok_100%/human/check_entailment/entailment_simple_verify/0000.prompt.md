You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(21)]
        idx = -1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(21)]
        
        idx = -1
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        
        nums.append(k + 1)
        
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        
        print(len(nums))
        
        print(*nums)
        
    #State: For each test case, the length of the modified `nums` list followed by the elements of the modified `nums` list.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly ensure that there is no subsequence of the sequence `a` that sums to `k`, while ensuring that all sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed by subsequences of `a`. Here are a few issues and counterexamples:

1. **Subsequence Summing to `k`**: The program does not guarantee that there is no subsequence of `a` that sums to `k`. Specifically, the way `k - nums[idx]` is added to `nums` could result in a subsequence that sums to `k`.

2. **Handling of `k`**: The program adds `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to `nums` without ensuring that these additions do not create a subsequence that sums to `k`. For example, if `k - nums[idx]` is a small number, it might be possible to form `k` by combining it with other elements in `nums`.

3. **Inclusion of `1 << idx`**: The removal of `1 << idx` from `nums` might not be sufficient to prevent subsequences that sum to `k`. The additions of `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` could still lead to a subsequence that sums to `k`.

Let's consider a specific counterexample:
- Input: `n = 10`, `k = 7`
- The program might generate a sequence like: `1, 2, 4, 8, 3, 8, 9, 12`
- Here, `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`, which is a subsequence that sums to `k`.

This counterexample shows that the program does not meet the requirement that there is no subsequence of `a` that sums to `k`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
