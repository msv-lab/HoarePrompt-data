### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python code to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

The goal is to construct a sequence `a` of non-negative integers with the following properties:
1. There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum equal to `k`.
2. For all `1 <= v <= n` where `v != k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum equal to `v`.

The given code attempts to construct such a sequence by generating a list of numbers and modifying it based on the value of `k`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. **Initialization**: The code initializes a list `nums` with the first 21 powers of 2 (i.e., `1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^20`). This set of numbers can generate any sum from 1 to 2^21 - 1 using subsequences.

2. **Finding the Index**: It then finds the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than `k`. This is done by iterating through the list and breaking when the power of 2 exceeds `k`.

3. **Modification**:
   - It appends `k - nums[idx]` to `nums`. This ensures that `k` cannot be formed as a sum of any subsequence of `nums` because `nums[idx]` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`, and `k - nums[idx]` is a new number that, when added to `nums[idx]`, equals `k`.
   - It appends `k + 1` to `nums`. This ensures that `k + 1` can be formed as a sum of a subsequence, which is necessary for the sequence to cover all sums up to `n`.
   - It appends `k + nums[idx] + 1` to `nums`. This ensures that another number greater than `k` is included, which might be necessary to form other sums up to `n`.
   - It removes the power of 2 at `nums[idx]` from `nums`. This step is crucial because it prevents `k` from being formed as a sum of any subsequence.

4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the length of the modified `nums` list and the elements of `nums`.

### Analysis:
- The initial list of powers of 2 ensures that any number from 1 to 2^21 - 1 can be formed as a sum of a subsequence.
- By appending `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, and removing `nums[idx]`, the code ensures that `k` cannot be formed as a sum while still allowing all other sums up to `n` to be formed.
- The code is designed to handle multiple test cases, and it does so by iterating through each test case and constructing the sequence independently.

### Conclusion:
The code appears to correctly solve the problem based on the provided logic. It constructs a sequence that meets the required conditions for each test case.

### Answer:
Correctness: **True**
