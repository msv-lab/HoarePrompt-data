You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: the values of `t`, `n`, and the initial state of `s` remain unchanged. The output consists of printed lines for each test case based on the conditions described in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` and prints 'NO' if all characters in `s` are the same, otherwise it prints 'YES' and then prints the lexicographically smallest string if `s` is not already sorted, or the lexicographically largest string if `s` is sorted.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - The first line contains an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
   - Each test case consists of a single string `s` of lowercase English letters.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, if it's impossible to rearrange the string `s` to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`, output "NO".
   - Otherwise, output "YES" and then one possible rearrangement `r` of the string `s` that is not equal to `s`.

### Key Observations:
- If the string `s` consists of all identical characters (i.e., the length of the set of characters in `s` is 1), then it's impossible to rearrange it to form a different string, so the output should be "NO".
- If the string `s` has more than one unique character, it's possible to rearrange it to form a different string. The program can achieve this by sorting the string in ascending and descending order and checking which one is different from the original string.

### Program Analysis:
1. The program correctly identifies the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. It checks if the length of the set of characters in the string `s` is 1. If true, it prints "NO".
3. If the length of the set of characters is more than 1, it prints "YES" and proceeds to find a different rearrangement:
   - It sorts the string in ascending order (`b = ''.join(sorted(s))`) and in descending order (`c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))`).
   - It then checks if the ascending order sorted string `b` is equal to the original string `s`. If `b` is not equal to `s`, it prints `b` as the rearranged string.
   - If `b` is equal to `s`, it prints the descending order sorted string `c` as the rearranged string.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the cases where the string cannot be rearranged to form a different string (all characters are the same) and where it can be rearranged. The choice between ascending and descending order ensures that a different string is always produced when possible.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
