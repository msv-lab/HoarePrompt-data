### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining if a subarray is "good" based on the conditions provided. The key insight is that for a subarray to be "good," the sum of its elements must be at least twice the number of elements in that subarray. This is because we need to be able to construct an array `b` where each element is greater than 0 and different from the corresponding element in `a` (the subarray), while maintaining the same sum.

The provided program calculates the prefix sums of the array `c` to efficiently compute the sum of any subarray. For each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray from `l_i` to `r_i` using the prefix sum array. It then checks if this sum is at least twice the number of elements in the subarray. If it is, the program outputs "YES," indicating the subarray is "good"; otherwise, it outputs "NO."

The logic in the program aligns with the problem's requirements. The prefix sum technique allows the program to handle the large input sizes efficiently.
