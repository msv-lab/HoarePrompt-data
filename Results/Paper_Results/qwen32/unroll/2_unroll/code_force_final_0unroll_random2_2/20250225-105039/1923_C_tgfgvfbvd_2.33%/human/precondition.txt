t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case is a tuple (n, q, c, queries) where n and q are integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5, c is a list of integers of length n where each element is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^9, and queries is a list of tuples where each tuple (l_i, r_i) represents the borders of a subarray and satisfies 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
