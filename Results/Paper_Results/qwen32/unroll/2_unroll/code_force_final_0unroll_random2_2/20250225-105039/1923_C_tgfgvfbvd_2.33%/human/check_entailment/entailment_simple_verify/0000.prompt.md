You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

The loop has finished executing all test cases, and for each query in each test case, it has printed either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition provided. The variables n, m, l, p, c, a, b, and s are not in a defined state as they are local to the loop iterations and do not persist after the loop completes.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine if a subarray is good according to the problem description. Specifically, the program checks if the sum of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray and if the subarray has more than one element. However, this condition is not sufficient to ensure that there exists an integer array \( b \) such that the sum of \( a \) and \( b \) are equal, \( a_i \neq b_i \) for every index \( i \), and \( b_i > 0 \) for every index \( i \).

Let's consider a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
3 1
1 1 1
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation of the Counterexample:**
- The subarray is \( [1, 1, 1] \).
- The sum of the subarray is \( 3 \).
- The length of the subarray is \( 3 \).
- The condition \( s \geq 2 \times (b - a + 1) \) translates to \( 3 \geq 2 \times 3 \), which is false.
- Therefore, the program correctly outputs "NO" for this case.

However, let's consider another case where the program might fail:

**Input:**
```
1
3 1
2 2 2
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of the Counterexample:**
- The subarray is \( [2, 2, 2] \).
- The sum of the subarray is \( 6 \).
- The length of the subarray is \( 3 \).
- The condition \( s \geq 2 \times (b - a + 1) \) translates to \( 6 \geq 2 \times 3 \), which is true.
- However, the program outputs "YES", which is correct, but let's consider a more tricky case.

**Input:**
```
1
3 1
1 2 3
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of the Counterexample:**
- The subarray is \( [1, 2, 3] \).
- The sum of the subarray is \( 6 \).
- The length of the subarray is \( 3 \).
- The condition \( s \geq 2 \times (b - a + 1) \) translates to \( 6 \geq 2 \times 3 \), which is true.
- However, let's consider a subarray where the sum is not sufficient to create a valid \( b \).

**Input:**
```
1
3 1
1 1 2
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation of the Counterexample:**
- The subarray is \( [1, 1, 2] \).
- The sum of the subarray is \( 4 \).
- The length of the subarray is \( 3 \).
- The condition \( s \geq 2 \times (b - a + 1) \) translates to \( 4 \geq 2 \times 3 \), which is false.
- Therefore, the program correctly outputs "NO" for this case.

However, the program does not correctly handle cases where the sum is sufficient but the individual elements cannot be rearranged to satisfy \( a_i \neq b_i \) and \( b_i > 0 \).

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all edge cases correctly.
