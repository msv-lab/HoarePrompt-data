You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, and for each of the t test cases, there is a string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings are distinct.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State: After executing the loop, for each of the `t` test cases, the program will have printed either 'A' or 'B' depending on whether the count of 'A's (`ac`) in the string is greater than the count of 'B's (`bc`). The variable `t` remains unchanged, and all `t` strings are still distinct as per the initial state.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: It then iterates `t` times, where each iteration corresponds to one test case.
3. **String Processing**: For each test case, it initializes two counters `ac` and `bc` to zero. These counters are used to count the occurrences of the characters 'A' and 'B' respectively in the string.
4. **Counting Characters**: It reads the string `s` and iterates through each character in the string. Depending on whether the character is 'A' or 'B', it increments the respective counter.
5. **Comparison and Output**: After counting the characters, it compares the two counters. If `ac` (the count of 'A's) is greater than `bc` (the count of 'B's), it prints 'A'. Otherwise, it prints 'B'.
6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases where all characters in the string are the same ('AAAAA' or 'BBBBB') and also handles cases where the counts are equal (though the problem statement does not specify what to do in such a case, the program defaults to printing 'B' if counts are equal).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine which letter ('A' or 'B') appears most frequently in each string. Given the constraints and the problem description, the program will produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
