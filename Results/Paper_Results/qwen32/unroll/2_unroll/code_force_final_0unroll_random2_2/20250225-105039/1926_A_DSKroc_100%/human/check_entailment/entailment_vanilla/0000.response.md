### Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: It then iterates `t` times, where each iteration corresponds to one test case.
3. **String Processing**: For each test case, it initializes two counters `ac` and `bc` to zero. These counters are used to count the occurrences of the characters 'A' and 'B' respectively in the string.
4. **Counting Characters**: It reads the string `s` and iterates through each character in the string. Depending on whether the character is 'A' or 'B', it increments the respective counter.
5. **Comparison and Output**: After counting the characters, it compares the two counters. If `ac` (the count of 'A's) is greater than `bc` (the count of 'B's), it prints 'A'. Otherwise, it prints 'B'.
6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases where all characters in the string are the same ('AAAAA' or 'BBBBB') and also handles cases where the counts are equal (though the problem statement does not specify what to do in such a case, the program defaults to printing 'B' if counts are equal).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine which letter ('A' or 'B') appears most frequently in each string. Given the constraints and the problem description, the program will produce the correct output for all valid inputs.
