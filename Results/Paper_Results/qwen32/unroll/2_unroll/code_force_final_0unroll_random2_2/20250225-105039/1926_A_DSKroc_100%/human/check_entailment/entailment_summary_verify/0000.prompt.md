You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a distinct string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. It then prints 'A' if the string contains more 'A's than 'B's, otherwise it prints 'B'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal. According to the problem description, the program should output one of the letters that appears most frequently. If both 'A' and 'B' appear the same number of times, the program will incorrectly output 'B'. 

For example, consider the input string "AABBB" and "BBAAB". Both strings have 3 'B's and 2 'A's, but the program will output 'B' for both, which is correct. However, consider the string "AABAA", which has 3 'A's and 2 'B's. The program will output 'A', which is correct. But consider the string "AABBB" and "BBBAA", both of which have 3 'B's and 2 'A's. The program will output 'B' for both, which is correct. However, if the input string is "AABBA" or "ABBAA" or any other string with an equal number of 'A's and 'B's, the program will output 'B', which is incorrect. It should output either 'A' or 'B' as they are equally frequent.

To fix this, the program should output either 'A' or 'B' when their counts are equal. One way to handle this is to modify the comparison to include equality and decide which letter to output in that case, or simply output 'A' when counts are equal.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        elif bc > ac:
            print('B')
        else:
            print('A')  # or print('B'), since they are equally frequent
```

This version ensures that when the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal, it outputs 'A' (or 'B', based on the preference).
