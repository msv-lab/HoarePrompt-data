Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Key Points to Check:
1. **Input Handling**: The program should correctly read the number of test cases and the encoded values.
2. **Decoding Logic**: The program should correctly decode the encoded value to find the lexicographically smallest word.
3. **Lexicographical Order**: The program should ensure that the resulting word is the smallest possible lexicographically.
4. **Edge Cases**: The program should handle all edge cases, including the minimum and maximum possible encoded values (3 to 78).

### Program Analysis:

The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each encoded value to determine the lexicographically smallest word. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the encoded value.

2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The program initializes an array `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
   - It then enters a loop to fill the first two positions of `arr`:
     - If the encoded value is less than 28, it assigns 1 to the position and subtracts 1 from the encoded value.
     - If the encoded value is between 28 and 51, it assigns 26 to the position and subtracts 26 from the encoded value.
     - If the encoded value is between 52 and 78, it assigns 26 to the position and subtracts 26 from the encoded value.
   - The third position is filled with the remaining encoded value.
   - The array is then sorted to ensure the lexicographically smallest order.
   - The positions are converted to letters and printed.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic for First Two Letters**:
   - The logic for assigning values to the first two positions is flawed. It does not correctly handle the distribution of the encoded value to ensure the smallest lexicographical order.
   - For example, if the encoded value is 24, the program might assign 1, 1, and 22 instead of 1, 1, and 22, which is correct, but the way it handles other values is incorrect.
   
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, if the encoded value is 3, it should output "aaa", which it does correctly. However, for other values, the logic fails to produce the correct result.

### Test Case Analysis:
Let's consider the test case `n = 55`:
- The program might assign values like 26, 26, and 3, which corresponds to "zzc". However, the correct answer should be "czz".

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the decoding logic to ensure the lexicographically smallest word for all possible encoded values. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.
