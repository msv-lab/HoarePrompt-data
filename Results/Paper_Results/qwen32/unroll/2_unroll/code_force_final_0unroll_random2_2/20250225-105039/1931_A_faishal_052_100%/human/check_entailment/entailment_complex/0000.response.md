Reasoning:
The provided code aims to determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have been encoded to a given sum. The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the encoded word. The code then tries to construct the lexicographically smallest word by distributing the sum `n` across three letters in such a way that the resulting word is the smallest possible in lexicographical order.

However, there are issues with the logic used to distribute the sum `n` across the three letters. Specifically, the code incorrectly handles the distribution of `n` by checking if `lex` (the remaining sum to be distributed) is less than 28 or 52, and appending 1 or 26 to the array `arr` accordingly. This logic does not guarantee that the resulting word will be the lexicographically smallest possible.

A correct approach would involve starting with the smallest possible letters (i.e., 'a', 'a', 'a') and incrementing the letters in a way that the sum of their positions equals `n`, while always keeping the word as small as possible in lexicographical order.

Here is an example of a correct approach:
1. Start with the word 'aaa' (positions 1, 1, 1).
2. Increment the last letter until the sum of the positions equals `n` or the letter becomes 'z'.
3. If the sum is still less than `n` after incrementing the last letter, move to the second last letter and repeat the process.
4. Continue this process until the sum of the positions equals `n`.

Given the issues in the provided code, it does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for all possible values of `n`.

Correctness: **False**
