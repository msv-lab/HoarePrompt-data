You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += 1
        print(shapes)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100.

            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += 1
        
        print(shapes)
        
    #State: a series of w integers, each representing the number of unique elements in the respective input lists that appear 3 or more times.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum number of regular (equal-sided) polygons that can be constructed simultaneously from the given sticks. The current implementation only checks if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length and increments the count of shapes by 1 for each such length group. However, this does not account for the fact that a polygon requires more than 3 sides (at least 4 for a square, 5 for a pentagon, etc.).

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
6
1 1 1 1 1 1
```
The program will output `1` because there are at least 3 sticks of length 1. However, the correct answer should be `0` because no regular polygon can be formed with sticks of length 1 (a triangle requires sticks of length greater than 1 to form a closed shape, and polygons with more sides require even longer sticks).

Another example:
```
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2
```
The program will output `1` because there are at least 3 sticks of length 2. However, the correct answer should be `1` for a hexagon, not `1` for a triangle. But the program does not differentiate between different possible polygons based on the number of sides required.

The program needs to be modified to correctly account for the minimum number of sides required for each polygon and ensure that the sticks can form valid polygons.
