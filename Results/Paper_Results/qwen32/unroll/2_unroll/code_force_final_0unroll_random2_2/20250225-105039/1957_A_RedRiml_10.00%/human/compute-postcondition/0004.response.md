Functionality: **The function reads an integer `w` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers. It then calculates and prints the number of unique integers in the list that appear at least 3 times. This process is repeated for each test case, resulting in `w` printed outputs.**
