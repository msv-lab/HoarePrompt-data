To understand the output state, we need to analyze the given loop and its effect on the variables. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Outer Loop (`for _ in range(w):`)**:
   - This loop runs `w` times. For each iteration, it performs the following steps:
     - Reads an integer `ln` from the input, which represents the number of elements in the list `palka`.
     - Reads a list `palka` of `ln` integers.
     - Initializes an empty list `pl` to keep track of unique elements in `palka`.
     - Initializes an empty dictionary `d` to count occurrences of each element in `palka`.

2. **Inner Loop (`for i in palka:`)**:
   - This loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `palka`.
   - If the element `i` is not already in the dictionary `d`, it adds `i` to `d` with a count of 1.
   - If the element `i` is already in the dictionary `d`, it increments the count of `i` in `d` by 1.
   - If the element `i` is not already in the list `pl`, it appends `i` to `pl`.

3. **Counting Shapes (`for j in pl:`)**:
   - This loop iterates over each unique element `j` in the list `pl`.
   - If the count of `j` in the dictionary `d` is 3 or more, it increments the variable `shapes` by 1.
   - After this loop, it prints the value of `shapes`.

The variable `shapes` represents the number of unique elements in `palka` that appear 3 or more times.

Since the loop runs `w` times, and for each iteration, it processes a different list `palka` and prints the number of shapes, the output state after all iterations will be a series of `w` printed values, each representing the number of shapes for the corresponding input list `palka`.

Given the initial state, the output state will be a series of `w` integers, each representing the number of unique elements in the respective input lists that appear 3 or more times.

**Output State: **a series of w integers, each representing the number of unique elements in the respective input lists that appear 3 or more times.**
