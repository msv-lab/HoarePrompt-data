You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 2 7
    
    2
    
    3 3
    
    5
    
    5 5 5 5 5
    
    6
    
    7 9 3 17 9 13
    
    3
    
    6 3 2
    
    5
    
    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        bets = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        prod = 1
        for i in range(bets):
            prod *= a[i]
        sumo = 0
        for i in range(bets):
            a[i] = prod // a[i]
            sumo += int(a[i])
        if sumo >= prod:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ans = ''
            for i in range(bets):
                ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `k` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a modified list where each element is the product of all elements in `k` divided by the element itself. It then checks if the sum of the modified list is greater than or equal to the product of all elements in `k`. If true, it outputs `-1`; otherwise, it outputs the modified list as a space-separated string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

The program calculates the product of all multipliers and then divides this product by each multiplier to get the bets. However, this approach does not guarantee that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Let's take a closer look at the example provided in the problem statement:

For the input:
```
3
3 2 7
```
The program calculates:
- `prod = 3 * 2 * 7 = 42`
- Then it sets `a[0] = 42 // 3 = 14`, `a[1] = 42 // 2 = 21`, `a[2] = 42 // 7 = 6`
- The total bet is `14 + 21 + 6 = 41`
- The returns are `3 * 14 = 42`, `2 * 21 = 42`, `7 * 6 = 42`

While this solution works for this example, it is not guaranteed to work for all cases. For instance, consider the following case:

Input:
```
3
2 2 2
```
The program calculates:
- `prod = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8`
- Then it sets `a[0] = 8 // 2 = 4`, `a[1] = 8 // 2 = 4`, `a[2] = 8 // 2 = 4`
- The total bet is `4 + 4 + 4 = 12`
- The returns are `2 * 4 = 8`, `2 * 4 = 8`, `2 * 4 = 8`

Here, the total bet (12) is not less than the returns for any winning outcome, which violates the problem's requirement.

A correct approach would be to set each bet to 1 and verify if the sum of bets is less than the minimum return. If not, then it is impossible to distribute the coins as required.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.
