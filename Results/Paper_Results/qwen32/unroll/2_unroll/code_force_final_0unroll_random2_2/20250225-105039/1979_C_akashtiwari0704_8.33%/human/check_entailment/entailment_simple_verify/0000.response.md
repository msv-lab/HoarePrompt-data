Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment step-by-step using the annotated code and the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. The received amount for a winning outcome `i` is `k_i * bet_i`.

### Program Analysis

The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the list of multipliers `k`.
3. It calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`).
4. For each outcome, it calculates the bet as `prod // k_i` and accumulates the total bet (`sumo`).
5. It checks if the total bet is less than the product. If not, it outputs `-1`.
6. Otherwise, it prints the calculated bets.

### Evaluation Using Annotations

Let's verify the program's behavior with the annotations and example inputs.

#### Example 1:
```
3
3 2 7
```
- `prod = 3 * 2 * 7 = 42`
- `a[0] = 42 // 3 = 14`, `a[1] = 42 // 2 = 21`, `a[2] = 42 // 7 = 6`
- `sumo = 14 + 21 + 6 = 41`
- `sumo < prod` (41 < 42), so the program outputs `14 21 6`.

This solution works correctly for this example.

#### Example 2:
```
3
2 2 2
```
- `prod = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8`
- `a[0] = 8 // 2 = 4`, `a[1] = 8 // 2 = 4`, `a[2] = 8 // 2 = 4`
- `sumo = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12`
- `sumo >= prod` (12 >= 8), so the program outputs `-1`.

This solution correctly identifies that it's impossible to distribute the coins as required.

### Verification of the Original Assessment

The original assessment challenges the program's correctness by providing a specific case:
```
3
2 2 2
```
The program correctly identifies that this case is unsolvable and outputs `-1`.

The assessment also suggests an alternative approach by setting each bet to 1 and verifying if the sum of bets is less than the minimum return. However, this approach is not necessary because the program's current method already ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome by construction.

### Conclusion

The program correctly solves the problem for the given constraints and examples. The original assessment incorrectly states that the program is incorrect based on an invalid counterexample.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**
