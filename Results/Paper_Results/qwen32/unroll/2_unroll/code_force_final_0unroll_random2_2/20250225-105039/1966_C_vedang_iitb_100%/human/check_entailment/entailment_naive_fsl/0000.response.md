Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. The logic used in the code does not align with the optimal strategy for the game. 

The game described is a variant of the Nim game, and the winner can be determined by calculating the Nim-sum (XOR-sum) of the pile sizes. If the Nim-sum is zero, the player who is about to move (Alice in this case) will lose if both players play optimally. Otherwise, Alice will win.

The code provided instead calculates the "mex" (minimum excludant) of the sorted pile sizes and compares it with the maximum pile size to determine the winner. This approach does not follow the correct strategy for solving the game.

Here is an example where the code does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Bob
```

**Actual Output:**
```
Alice
```

In this case, the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is 1 XOR 1 XOR 1 = 1, which is non-zero. However, Alice cannot make a move that will leave a Nim-sum of zero for Bob, so Bob will win if both play optimally. The code incorrectly outputs "Alice" for this input. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
