To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the variable `t` since it is the only variable mentioned in the loop condition. The loop will execute as long as `t` is truthy (i.e., `t` is not zero).

Given that `t` is described as "an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4," it is clear that `t` will always be greater than 0, and thus, the loop condition `while t:` will always be satisfied for the initial state provided.

Therefore, no adjustments need to be made to the state of `t` for the loop to execute the first time. The state right before the loop can be repeated as is.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n. Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 <= r_i <= n and 1 <= c_i <= n. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. The k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.**
