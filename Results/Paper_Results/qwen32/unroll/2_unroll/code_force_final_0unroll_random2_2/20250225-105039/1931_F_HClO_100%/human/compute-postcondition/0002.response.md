Output State: **For each test case, the program prints 'yes' if the order of participants in all screenshots can be made consistent by inserting the author of the screenshot at the correct position in the list. Otherwise, it prints 'no'. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and the lists `a1, l1, a2, l2, l11, l22, idx1, idx2, p1, p2, val, a3, l3` are not preserved after each test case as they are reinitialized in each iteration of the outer loop.**
