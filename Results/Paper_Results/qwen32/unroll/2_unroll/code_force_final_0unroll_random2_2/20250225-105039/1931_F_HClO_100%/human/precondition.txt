t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5. Each of the k lines contains a permutation of n integers a_{ij} (1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n) representing the order of participants seen in the screenshot, with a_{i0} being the author of the screenshot and always at the top of the list. All a_{i0} values are distinct across the k screenshots.
