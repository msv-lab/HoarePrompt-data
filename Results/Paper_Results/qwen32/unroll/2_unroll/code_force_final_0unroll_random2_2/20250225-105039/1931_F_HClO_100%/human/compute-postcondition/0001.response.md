In the provided task, the loop is controlled by the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop will execute `t` times. To ensure that the loop executes, the variable `t` must be at least 1. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `a_{ij}`) are defined within the loop body and do not affect whether the loop itself executes or not.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Loop Control Variable**: The loop is controlled by `_` which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that is not used within the loop body. The number of iterations is determined by `t`.

2. **Adjustments Needed**: To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `a_{ij}`) do not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because they are defined and used within each iteration of the loop.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t`. The initial state of `t` must be such that it is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
