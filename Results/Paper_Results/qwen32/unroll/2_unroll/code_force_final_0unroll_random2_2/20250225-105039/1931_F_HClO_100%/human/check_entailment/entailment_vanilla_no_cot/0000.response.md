Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the algorithm used to determine if there is a consistent order of participants across multiple screenshots is flawed. Here are a few issues:

1. **Handling of Multiple Screenshots**: The program only properly compares the first two screenshots and then assumes the rest of the screenshots will follow the same pattern. However, it does not handle cases where there are more than two screenshots and the order inferred from the first two screenshots does not match the rest.

2. **Index Handling**: The logic for handling indices (`idx1` and `idx2`) and inserting the second participant at the correct position in the list is not robust enough to handle all possible scenarios.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not correctly handle edge cases where the number of participants (`n`) is small or where the number of screenshots (`k`) is large relative to `n`.

4. **General Logic**: The algorithm's logic for determining the correct order and verifying it against all screenshots is overly complex and does not account for all possible valid orders that could produce the given screenshots.

A correct solution would involve reconstructing the order of participants based on the screenshots and then verifying that this order is consistent with all given screenshots. This typically involves using a graph-based approach where each screenshot provides a constraint on the order, and you check if these constraints can be satisfied simultaneously.

Here is a more correct approach using a graph-based solution:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    import threading

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read().split()
        index = 0
        t = int(input[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(t):
            n = int(input[index])
            k = int(input[index + 1])
            index += 2
            orders = []
            for _ in range(k):
                orders.append(list(map(int, input[index:index + n])))
                index += n
            if k == 1:
                results.append("YES")
                continue
            # Create a directed graph from the orders
            graph = {i: [] for i in range(1, n + 1)}
            in_degree = {i: 0 for i in range(1, n + 1)}
            for order in orders:
                for i in range(n - 1):
                    graph[order[i]].append(order[i + 1])
                    in_degree[order[i + 1]] += 1
            # Check if there is a topological sort
            queue = [node for node in in_degree if in_degree[node] == 0]
            topo_order = []
            while queue:
                if len(queue) > 1:
                    results.append("NO")
                    break
                node = queue.pop(0)
                topo_order.append(node)
                for neighbor in graph[node]:
                    in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
                    if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                        queue.append(neighbor)
            if len(topo_order) == n:
                results.append("YES")
            else:
                results.append("NO")
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    threading.Thread(target=main).start()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

This solution constructs a directed graph based on the relative positions of participants in the screenshots and checks if there is a unique topological sort of the graph, which corresponds to a consistent order of participants.
