The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of participants and their order as seen by different authors. For each test case, it determines if it's possible to make the order of participants consistent across all screenshots by inserting the author of each screenshot at the correct position. It prints 'yes' if the orders can be made consistent, otherwise it prints 'no'.
