Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Provided Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a different approach than brute force. Let's break down the program:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases \(T\). For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Logic**:
    - The program initializes `suma` to 0.
    - It then iterates over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
    - For each \(b\), it calculates \(x\) using the formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\), where \(i\) is the current value of \(b\).
    - If \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\), it adds \(x\) to `suma`.
    - Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

3. **Output**: The program outputs the number of valid pairs for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis

The provided program does not seem to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The formula used to calculate `x` and the overall logic to count the valid pairs do not match the problem's requirements.

Let's consider a simple test case to verify:

For \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\):
- The only pair is \((1, 1)\).
- \(a + b = 1 + 1 = 2\).
- \(\gcd(1, 1) = 1\).
- \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\).
- Since 2 is a multiple of 1, the pair \((1, 1)\) is valid.

The program should output 1 for this test case. However, the provided program's logic does not ensure this. Specifically, the formula used to calculate `x` and the subsequent summation do not align with the problem's constraints and requirements.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic and formula used do not accurately count the number of valid ordered pairs \((a, b)\).

**Correctness: False**
