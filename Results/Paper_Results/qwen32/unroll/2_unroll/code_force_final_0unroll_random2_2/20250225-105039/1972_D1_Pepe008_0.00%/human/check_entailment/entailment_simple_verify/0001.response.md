### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the provided program and the annotated version to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Condition Analysis Recap:
The condition simplifies to finding pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a\) is a multiple of \(b\). For each \(b\), \(a\) can be any multiple of \(b\) up to \(n\).

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program is:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)

func()
```

#### Annotated Code:
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points, but they do not correct the logical issues in the code. The annotations state that `t` is the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are positive integers. The program reads these values and then attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Variable Name Error**: The loop should iterate over `m` instead of `b`. The variable `b` is incorrectly used as the upper limit for the loop.
2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` is not correct for counting multiples of `i` up to `n`. The correct way to count multiples of `i` up to `n` is `n // i`.
3. **Incorrect Result Adjustment**: Subtracting 1 from the final result is incorrect.

#### Correct Implementation:
A correct implementation should be:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        suma = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            suma += n // b
        print(suma)

func()
```

#### Final Evaluation:
The program provided does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\). It has multiple issues, including incorrect variable usage, incorrect calculation, and incorrect result adjustment.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
