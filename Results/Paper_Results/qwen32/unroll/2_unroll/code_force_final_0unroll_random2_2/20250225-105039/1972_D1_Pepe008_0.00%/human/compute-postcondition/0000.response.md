Output State: **`T` is an input integer, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The sum of `n` and the sum of `m` over all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.**

Explanation: The variable `T` is assigned the value of the integer input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`) retain their initial conditions as they have not been modified by the code snippet provided.
