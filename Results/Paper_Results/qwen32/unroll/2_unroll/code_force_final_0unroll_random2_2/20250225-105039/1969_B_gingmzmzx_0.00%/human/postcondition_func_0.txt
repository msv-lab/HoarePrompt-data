The function `func_1` processes a series of binary strings, each representing a test case. For each string, it calculates a value based on the positions of '0's and '1's and prints this value. The printed value for each test case represents the number of valid pairs of indices (i, j) such that i < j and the substring s[i:j+1] contains at least one '0' and one '1'.
