Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the solution is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires transforming a binary string into a non-descending order (sorted in ascending order) using the minimum cost of cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.

### Solution Analysis
The provided solution calculates the minimum cost to sort the string in ascending order. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the binary string `s` is read and converted into a list of integers (`0` and `1`).

2. **Counting Zeroes:**
   - The number of zeroes in the string is counted and stored in `zeroes`.

3. **Counters and Cost Calculation:**
   - Two counters, `cnt[0]` and `cnt[1]`, are initialized to zero. These counters keep track of the number of zeroes and ones encountered so far.
   - `ans` is initialized to zero. This variable will store the total cost.
   
4. **Iterating Through the String:**
   - For each character `c` in the string `s`:
     - The corresponding counter (`cnt[0]` or `cnt[1]`) is incremented.
     - If the character is `0`:
       - The cost is incremented by `1` if there is at least one `1` encountered so far (`cnt[1] > 0`). This is because a `0` can only be moved to the left if there are `1`s to the left of it.
     - If the character is `1`:
       - The cost is incremented by the number of zeroes that have not been encountered yet (`zeroes - cnt[0]`). This is because each `1` needs to be moved past all the remaining zeroes to the right.

### Verification
The logic of the solution seems correct based on the problem statement. The cost calculation takes into account the number of operations needed to move each `0` past all the `1`s to its left and each `1` past all the `0`s to its right. The cost for moving a `0` is `1` if there is at least one `1` to the left, and the cost for moving a `1` is the number of remaining zeroes to the right.

### Conclusion
The provided solution appears to be correct and efficiently calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string in ascending order using the described operations.

**Correctness: True**
