### Reasoning:
To determine if the program is correct, we need to analyze whether the provided algorithm correctly calculates the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using the allowed operations.

The program iterates through each test case, converting the binary string into a list of integers (0s and 1s). It then counts the number of zeroes in the string. The variable `cnt` is used to keep track of the count of 0s and 1s encountered so far. The variable `ans` is used to accumulate the total cost.

The logic of the program is as follows:
- For each character `c` in the string:
  - If `c` is 0:
    - Increment the count of 0s (`cnt[0]`).
    - If there are any 1s encountered before (i.e., `cnt[1] > 0`), it means that we need to perform a cyclic shift to bring this 0 to the position after all the 1s encountered so far. The cost of this operation is 1, so we increment `ans` by 1.
  - If `c` is 1:
    - Increment the count of 1s (`cnt[1]`).
    - The number of operations needed to bring this 1 to the end of the string (after all the 0s) is the total number of zeroes in the string (`zeroes`) minus the number of zeroes encountered so far (`cnt[0]`). This is because all the zeroes encountered so far are already in the correct position, and we need to shift this 1 past all the remaining zeroes. We add this value to `ans`.

The final value of `ans` for each test case is printed as the minimum total cost.

This approach correctly calculates the cost because it accounts for the number of operations needed to move each 0 to the correct position after all the 1s encountered so far and each 1 to the correct position after all the zeroes encountered so far. The cost is calculated as the sum of these operations.

### Correctness:
Based on the analysis, the provided program correctly computes the minimum total cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the allowed operations.

**Correctness: True**
