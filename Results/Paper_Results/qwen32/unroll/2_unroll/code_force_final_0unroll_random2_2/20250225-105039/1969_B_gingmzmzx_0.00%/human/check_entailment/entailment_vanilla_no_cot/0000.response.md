Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program attempts to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts, but the logic used is flawed.

The key idea in the problem is to understand the cost of operations needed to sort the string. The provided program seems to be trying to count the number of inversions or transitions from '1' to '0' and then calculating the cost based on that, but it does not correctly account for the minimum cost required to perform the cyclic shifts to sort the string.

Here's a brief overview of a correct approach:
1. Identify the point in the string where the sequence transitions from '1's to '0's.
2. Calculate the cost of shifting the substring to sort the string. This involves moving all '1's to the front and all '0's to the back.
3. The cost is determined by the number of operations needed to achieve this configuration, which can be computed based on the number of '1's and '0's in the string.

The provided program does not follow this logic and hence does not correctly compute the minimum cost. Therefore, the correctness is False.
