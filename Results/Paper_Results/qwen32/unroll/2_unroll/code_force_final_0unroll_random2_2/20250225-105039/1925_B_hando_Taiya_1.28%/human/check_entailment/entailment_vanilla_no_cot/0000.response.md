To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly computes the maximum balance (GCD) of the difficulties of the sub-problems such that their sum equals \( x \) and there are exactly \( n \) sub-problems.

The program's logic is as follows:
1. For each test case, it reads the integers \( x \) and \( n \).
2. It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum balance found.
3. It iterates over all possible divisors \( i \) of \( x \) up to the integer square root of \( x \).
4. For each divisor \( i \):
   - It checks if \( n \) is less than or equal to \( \frac{x}{i} \). If true, it updates `ans` to be the maximum of `ans` and \( i \).
   - It also checks if \( n \) is less than or equal to \( i \). If true, it updates `ans` to be the maximum of `ans` and \( \frac{x}{i} \).
5. It prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

The key part of the program is the logic to determine the maximum balance. The program is trying to find the largest divisor \( d \) of \( x \) such that the problem can be split into \( n \) sub-problems with each having a difficulty that is a multiple of \( d \).

The program's logic is correct because:
- It checks all possible divisors of \( x \).
- For each divisor \( i \), it checks if it can be the GCD of the difficulties of the sub-problems.
- It considers both \( i \) and \( \frac{x}{i} \) as potential candidates for the GCD.

However, there is a small issue with the function call `func_1()` inside the loop. The function `func_1()` is defined to take no arguments, but it reads input inside it. This is not a correctness issue per se, but it's an unusual design choice. The function should be called without arguments, and it should handle the input reading internally.

Despite this minor design issue, the logic of the program is correct. Therefore, the response is:

Correctness: **True**
