### Reasoning:

The goal of the problem is to find the maximum balance of a problemset, which is defined as the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difficulties of all sub-problems, such that the sum of the difficulties equals `x` and there are exactly `n` sub-problems.

The provided program attempts to solve this problem by finding the largest divisor of `x` that can be used to split `x` into `n` sub-problems. Here’s how the program works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.
2. **Finding the Largest Divisor**:
   - It iterates over all possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the integer square root of `x` (inclusive).
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks two conditions:
     - If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it means we can split `x` into `n` sub-problems where each sub-problem has a difficulty of at least `i`.
     - If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, it means we can split `x` into `n` sub-problems where each sub-problem has a difficulty of at least `x // i`.
   - It keeps track of the maximum divisor `i` that satisfies either of these conditions.
3. **Output**: The program prints the maximum divisor found, which is the maximum balance.

Let’s verify if this approach works correctly based on the example provided:

- **First Test Case (10 3)**:
  - Divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10.
  - For `i = 1`: `n = 3 <= x // 1 = 10` → `ans = max(ans, 1) = 1`
  - For `i = 2`: `n = 3 <= x // 2 = 5` → `ans = max(ans, 2) = 2`
  - For `i = 5`: `n = 3 <= 5` → `ans = max(ans, 5) = 5` (but `n` cannot be 5, so we need to check if `n <= i` which is not the case here)
  - For `i = 10`: `n = 3` is not less than or equal to `10`.
  - The largest valid `i` is 2, which matches the output.

- **Second Test Case (5 5)**:
  - Divisors of 5 are 1, 5.
  - For `i = 1`: `n = 5 <= x // 1 = 5` → `ans = max(ans, 1) = 1`
  - For `i = 5`: `n = 5` is not less than or equal to `5 // 5 = 1`.
  - The largest valid `i` is 1, which matches the output.

- **Third Test Case (420 69)**:
  - Divisors of 420 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420.
  - For `i = 6`: `n = 69 <= x // 6 = 70` → `ans = max(ans, 6) = 6`
  - The largest valid `i` is 6, which matches the output.

The logic correctly finds the largest divisor of `x` that can be used to split `x` into `n` sub-problems, ensuring the balance is maximized.
