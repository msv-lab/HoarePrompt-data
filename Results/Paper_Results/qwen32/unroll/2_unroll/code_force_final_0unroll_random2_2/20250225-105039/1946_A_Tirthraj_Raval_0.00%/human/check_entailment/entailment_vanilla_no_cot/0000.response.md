Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The program sorts the array and then counts the occurrences of the median element, which does not give the correct number of operations needed to increase the median.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to determine how many elements are less than or equal to the current median and how many operations are needed to increase the median to the next possible value. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    """Median of Array"""
    import heapq
    import sys
    
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        
        a.sort()
        mid = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        current_median = a[mid]
        
        # Find the next distinct element greater than the current median
        next_median = current_median + 1
        while next_median in a and a.count(next_median) > 0:
            next_median += 1
        
        # Calculate the number of elements less than or equal to the current median
        count_le_current_median = mid + 1
        
        # Calculate the number of operations needed to make the next_median the new median
        operations = 0
        for i in range(count_le_current_median):
            if a[i] < next_median:
                operations += next_median - a[i]
        
        results.append(operations)
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

# Call the function to execute the program
func()
```

This program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array by finding the next distinct element greater than the current median and calculating the operations needed to make at least half of the elements in the array greater than or equal to this next median.
