You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input arguments. However, the input to the function is provided through standard input and consists of multiple test cases. Each test case contains two positive integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 26). The first line of input contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 676) denoting the number of test cases.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'
    return s[:k] * n
    #The program returns a string that consists of the first `k` characters of 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw' repeated `n` times.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts no input arguments. It reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two positive integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 26). The first line of input contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 676) denoting the number of test cases. For each test case, the function returns a string that consists of the first `k` characters of the alphabet 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw' repeated `n` times.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a string that consists of the first `k` characters of 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw' repeated `n` times.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
