Reasoning:

The provided Python program is supposed to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. The program takes `t` test cases as input, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`.

The key part of the program is the function `func_1`, which is supposed to generate the required string `s`. However, the current implementation of `func_1` is incorrect because it simply repeats the first `k` letters of the alphabet `n` times. This does not guarantee that all possible subsequences of length `n` will be present.

For example, consider the test case `n = 2` and `k = 2`. The possible subsequences of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets are "aa", "ab", "ba", and "bb". The program's output for this test case would be "aabb" or similar, which does not contain "ba" as a subsequence.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should generate a De Bruijn sequence for the given `n` and `k`, which is a cyclic sequence in which every possible string of length `n` appears as a subsequence exactly once. However, the provided code does not do this.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
