Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. 

Let's analyze the given program:

```python
import collections
from collections import Counter
from collections import defaultdict
import math
from math import log

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    res = func_1()
    print(res)

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'
    return s[:k] * n
```

The program simply takes the first `k` letters of the alphabet and repeats this sequence `n` times. This approach does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` letters appear as subsequences in `s`.

For example, let's consider the test case `n = 2` and `k = 2`. The possible strings of length 2 that can be formed are `aa`, `ab`, `ba`, and `bb`. The program would generate `s = 'abab'` (since `k = 2` and `n = 2`), which does not contain `ba` as a subsequence.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem description for this and many other test cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
