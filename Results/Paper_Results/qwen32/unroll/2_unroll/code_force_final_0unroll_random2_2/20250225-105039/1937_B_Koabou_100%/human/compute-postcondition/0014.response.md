Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the length of a 2 Ã— n grid, followed by two binary strings of length `n` that represent the top and bottom rows of the grid. The function processes these test cases and returns a result for each one.**
