Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the grid. The next two lines contain binary strings of length `n`, representing the top and bottom rows of the 2 × `n` grid, respectively. It is guaranteed that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `a` is an empty list. `n` is assigned the value of the first integer input for the current test case.**

In simple terms, `n` is now the first integer input for the current test case, and all other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
