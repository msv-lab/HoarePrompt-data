For the given task, the only variable in the loop head is `T` and the range it iterates over is determined by `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The state of `t` is the only thing we can adjust to ensure the loop executes.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop iterates over `range(t)`, meaning it will execute `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.
3. The variables `n` and `m` are mentioned as part of the input for each test case, but they are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted in this context.
4. The initial state of `t` is given as an input integer representing the number of test cases.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1**
