You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6. The input starts with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        
        ans = n
        
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: For each test case, the output is the final value of `ans` after the loop has computed the sum of `n` and the integer divisions `(n + b) // (b * b)` for all `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and each test case's `n` and `m` are processed independently to produce a separate output value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates a result based on `n` and the integer divisions `(n + b) // (b * b)` for all `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`, and prints this result. The number of test cases is specified by the input integer `t`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided program against the problem description:

### Problem Description Recap
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis
Here is the provided program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)
```

### Verification
Let's go through the logic of the program and see if it meets the problem description.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `ans = n` initializes the count with the number of pairs where \(b = 1\). This is correct because for \(b = 1\), \(a + b\) is always a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, 1) = b \cdot 1 = 1\).

2. **Loop through \(b\)**:
   - The loop runs from \(b = 2\) to \(\min(n, m)\).
   - For each \(b\), it adds \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to `ans`.

3. **Calculation**:
   - The formula \((n + b) // (b * b)\) is supposed to count the number of valid \(a\) for each \(b\).

### Checking the formula
Let's check if \((n + b) // (b * b)\) correctly counts the number of valid \(a\).

- The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be written as:
  \[
  a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
  \]
  for some integer \(k\).

- Since \(\gcd(a, b)\) divides both \(a\) and \(b\), let \(a = d \cdot x\) and \(b = d \cdot y\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). Then the condition becomes:
  \[
  d \cdot x + d \cdot y = k \cdot d \cdot y
  \]
  Simplifying:
  \[
  x + y = k \cdot y
  \]
  \[
  x = (k - 1) \cdot y
  \]

- So, \(a = d \cdot (k - 1) \cdot y\). Since \(a \le n\):
  \[
  d \cdot (k - 1) \cdot y \le n
  \]
  \[
  d \le \frac{n}{(k - 1) \cdot y}
  \]

- The number of valid \(d\) is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(k - 1) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

- Summing over all possible \(k\) and \(y\) is complex, but the provided formula \((n + b) // (b * b)\) seems to be an attempt to simplify this.

### Testing with Examples
Let's test the provided program with the given examples to see if it produces the correct output.

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `1 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Program Output: `1`
   - Correct.

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `2 3`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Program Output: `3`
   - Correct.

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `3 5`
   - Expected Output: `4`
   - Program Output: `4`
   - Correct.

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `10 8`
   - Expected Output: `14`
   - Program Output: `14`
   - Correct.

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - Input: `100 1233`
   - Expected Output: `153`
   - Program Output: `153`
   - Correct.

6. **Sixth Test Case**:
   - Input: `1000000 1145141`
   - Expected Output: `1643498`
   - Program Output: `1643498`
   - Correct.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis and testing with the provided examples, the program seems to produce the correct output for the given test cases. However, we need to ensure that the formula \((n + b) // (b * b)\) correctly counts the number of valid pairs for all possible inputs within the constraints.

Since no counterexample has been found and the program works correctly for the provided test cases, we can assume it is correct.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program initializes the count with `n` for \(b = 1\) and then iterates through possible values of \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\), adding \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to the count. This formula seems to correctly count the number of valid \(a\) for each \(b\), and the program produces the correct output for the provided test cases.
