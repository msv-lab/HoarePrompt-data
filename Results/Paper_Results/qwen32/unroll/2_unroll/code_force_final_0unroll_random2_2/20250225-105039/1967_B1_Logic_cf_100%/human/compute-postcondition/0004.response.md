Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates a result based on `n` and the integer divisions `(n + b) // (b * b)` for all `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`, and prints this result. The number of test cases is specified by the input integer `t`.**
