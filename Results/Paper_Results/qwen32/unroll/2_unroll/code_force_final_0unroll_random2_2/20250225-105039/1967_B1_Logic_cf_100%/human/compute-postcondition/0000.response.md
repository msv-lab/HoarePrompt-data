Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two positive integers `n` and `m` such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2 · 10^6. The sum of `n` and the sum of `m` over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^6.**

In this state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first input, which is the number of test cases. The other variables `n` and `m` are still awaiting their values, as they are part of the test cases that will be read in subsequent steps. The constraints on `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
