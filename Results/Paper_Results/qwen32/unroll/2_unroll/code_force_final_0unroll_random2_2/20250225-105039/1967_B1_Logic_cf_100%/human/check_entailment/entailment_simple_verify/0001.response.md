Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Key Observations

1. For \(b = 1\), \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1) = 1\). Therefore, there are \(n\) valid pairs when \(b = 1\).
2. For \(b > 1\), we need \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This can be expressed as \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for some integer \(k\). Simplifying, we get \(a = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b\). For \(a\) to be valid, it must be in the range \([1, n]\).

### Simplification

Given the constraints, an efficient way to count valid pairs is to iterate over possible values of \(b\) and count the number of valid \(a\) for each \(b\). The provided program does this by iterating \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\) and adding \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b \cdot b} \right\rfloor\) to the answer.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
2. For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
3. It initializes the answer \(ans\) with \(n\) (since there are \(n\) valid pairs for \(b = 1\)).
4. It then iterates \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\) and adds \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b \cdot b} \right\rfloor\) to the answer.
5. Finally, it prints the answer for each test case.

### Verification

The formula \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b \cdot b} \right\rfloor\) is intended to count the number of valid \(a\) for each \(b\). However, let's verify if this formula is correct.

For a given \(b\), \(a\) must satisfy:
\[ a = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b \]
where \(k\) is an integer. This can be rewritten as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
or
\[ \frac{a + b}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} = k \]
This means \(a + b\) must be divisible by \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Let's denote \(\gcd(a, b) = d\), so \(a = d \cdot a_1\) and \(b = d \cdot b_1\) where \(\gcd(a_1, b_1) = 1\). Then the condition becomes:
\[ d \cdot a_1 + d \cdot b_1 = k \cdot d \cdot b_1 \]
or
\[ a_1 + b_1 = k \cdot b_1 \]
which simplifies to:
\[ a_1 = (k - 1) \cdot b_1 \]
Since \(\gcd(a_1, b_1) = 1\), the only valid \(k\) is 2, so:
\[ a_1 = b_1 \]
Thus, \(a = d \cdot b_1\). The condition then becomes:
\[ a = d \cdot b_1 \]
and \(a\) must be in the range \([1, n]\). Therefore, \(d \cdot b_1 \le n\), or \(d \le \frac{n}{b_1}\). Since \(d\) is a divisor of \(b\), we need to count the number of valid \(a\) for each \(b\).

The provided formula \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b \cdot b} \right\rfloor\) does not correctly count the number of valid \(a\) for each \(b\). Instead, it should count the number of valid \(d\) for each \(b\).

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The formula used in the program does not accurately count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).
