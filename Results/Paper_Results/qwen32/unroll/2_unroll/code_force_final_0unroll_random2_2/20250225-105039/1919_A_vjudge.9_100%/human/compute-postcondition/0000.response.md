The code provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive. After executing the code, `t` will hold the value of the integer input, and the conditions on `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) remain valid. Since no other variables are mentioned or modified in the code, their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.**
