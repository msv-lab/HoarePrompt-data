To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze the game mechanics and the logic implemented in the code.

### Game Mechanics Analysis

1. **Game Rules**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns.
   - Each turn, a player can either swap wallets or not.
   - A player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - If the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets (`abs(a - b)`) is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves and force Alice into a losing position.
   - If the absolute difference is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by making a move that leaves an even difference for Bob.

### Program Logic Analysis

The provided program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

### Annotations

The annotations confirm that the program processes each test case correctly:

- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
- It calculates the absolute difference between the coins in both wallets.
- It checks the parity of this difference:
  - If the difference is even, it prints "Bob".
  - If the difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Input**: `1 1`
   - Difference: `abs(1 - 1) = 0` (even)
   - **Output**: `Bob` (Correct)

2. **Input**: `1 4`
   - Difference: `abs(1 - 4) = 3` (odd)
   - **Output**: `Alice` (Correct)

3. **Input**: `5 3`
   - Difference: `abs(5 - 3) = 2` (even)
   - **Output**: `Bob` (Correct)

4. **Input**: `4 5`
   - Difference: `abs(4 - 5) = 1` (odd)
   - **Output**: `Alice` (Correct)

5. **Input**: `1000000000 1000000000`
   - Difference: `abs(1000000000 - 1000000000) = 0` (even)
   - **Output**: `Bob` (Correct)

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The annotations and the examples provided confirm that the program behaves as expected.

**Final: True**
