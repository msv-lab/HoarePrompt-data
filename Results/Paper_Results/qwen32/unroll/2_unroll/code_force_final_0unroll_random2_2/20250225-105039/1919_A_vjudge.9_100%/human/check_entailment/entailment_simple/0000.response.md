### Reasoning:

The problem involves determining the winner of a game based on the number of coins Alice and Bob have in their wallets. The game rules are as follows:

1. Players take turns, with Alice starting first.
2. In each turn, a player can choose to swap wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet.
3. After choosing a wallet, the player must remove 1 coin from the chosen wallet.
4. The player who cannot make a move (i.e., when they have no coins left in their chosen wallet) loses.

The key insight to solve this problem is to recognize that the game can be reduced to a simple parity (even or odd) check on the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. Here's why:

- If the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves and ensure that he will be the one to make the last move, thus winning the game.
- If the absolute difference is odd, Alice can make a move that ensures the difference becomes even, putting Bob in the position where he will face an even difference on his turn, eventually leading to Alice's victory.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd and prints "Bob" or "Alice" accordingly.
