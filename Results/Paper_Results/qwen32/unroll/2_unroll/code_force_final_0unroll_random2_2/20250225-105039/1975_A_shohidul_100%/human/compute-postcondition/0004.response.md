Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It checks if the list is non-decreasing or if it can be made non-decreasing by removing the first element. For each test case, it outputs "YES" if the list meets the criteria and "NO" otherwise.**
