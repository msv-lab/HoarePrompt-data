### Reasoning

The original assessment accurately identifies several critical flaws in the provided program:

1. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**: The program calculates the penalty based on the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters. This does not align with the problem's requirement, which is to calculate the penalty for each subarray as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

2. **No Subarray Splitting**: The program does not perform any splitting of the array into subarrays to calculate penalties for each subarray. It simply computes the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which does not reflect the intended logic.

3. **No Optimization**: The program does not attempt to find an optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty. The problem requires an optimal splitting strategy, which is not implemented in the provided code.

### Verification Using Annotated Code

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `expression`. This matches the incorrect logic described in the original assessment.

### Conclusion

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program is incorrect. The program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
