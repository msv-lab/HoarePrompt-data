Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem described. The task is to find the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array optimally. The penalty for a split is based on the absolute sum of each subarray multiplied by its length. The program, however, calculates only the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and returns it. This approach does not consider any splitting of the array and does not account for the penalty calculation based on subarrays.

The correct approach should involve evaluating different ways to split the array and calculating the total penalty for each split, then selecting the split with the minimum penalty. The provided program's logic is entirely unrelated to this requirement.

Correctness: **False**
