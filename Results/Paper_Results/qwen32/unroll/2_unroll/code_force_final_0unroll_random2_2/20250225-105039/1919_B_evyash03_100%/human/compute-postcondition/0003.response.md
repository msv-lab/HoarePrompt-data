The code snippet assigns the value of `length - count` to the variable `sub`. Given the initial state, `length` is the length of the string `expression`, and `count` is the number of '+' characters in the string `expression`. The value of `sub` will be the number of '-' characters in the string `expression` because `length` is the total number of characters, and `count` is the number of '+' characters.

Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting of the characters '+' and '-', `length` is a positive integer representing the length of the string such that `length == len(expression)`, `count` is the number of '+' characters in the string `expression`, `sub` is the number of '-' characters in the string `expression`.**
