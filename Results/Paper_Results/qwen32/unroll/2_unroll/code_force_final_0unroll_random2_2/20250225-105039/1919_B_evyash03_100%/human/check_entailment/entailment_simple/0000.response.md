Reasoning:  
The given program is incorrect. The program calculates the minimum penalty by returning the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `expression`. However, the problem requires calculating the minimum possible penalty based on the optimal splitting of the array into non-empty subarrays, where the penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The provided program does not perform any splitting of the array and does not calculate the penalty based on the optimal splitting strategy. Instead, it simply calculates the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which does not solve the problem as described.

For example, in the third test case, the input string is `+-+-+-`. The optimal splitting is `([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1])`, which results in a penalty of 0. However, the program would return `abs(3-3) = 0`, which coincidentally matches the correct answer for this specific case but does not represent the correct logic for solving the problem.

Correctness: **False**
