Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap
We need to find the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s` into non-empty subarrays. The penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The goal is to minimize the total penalty.

### Analysis of the Provided Program

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.
3. It then calls `func_1` with `expression` (the string `s`) and `length` (the length of `s`).
4. Inside `func_1`, it counts the number of '+' characters in the string `expression`.
5. It calculates `sub` as `length - count`, which is the number of '-' characters.
6. It returns the absolute value of the difference between the count of '+' and '-' characters.

### Flaws in the Program

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum penalty. Here's why:

- **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**: The program calculates the penalty based on the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which does not align with the problem's requirement of minimizing the sum of penalties of subarrays.
- **No Subarray Splitting**: The program does not perform any splitting of the array into subarrays to calculate penalties for each subarray.
- **No Optimization**: The program does not attempt to find an optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Convert the string `s` into an array `a` where '+' is 1 and '-' is -1.
2. Try different ways to split the array `a` into subarrays.
3. Calculate the penalty for each possible split and choose the one with the minimum total penalty.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
