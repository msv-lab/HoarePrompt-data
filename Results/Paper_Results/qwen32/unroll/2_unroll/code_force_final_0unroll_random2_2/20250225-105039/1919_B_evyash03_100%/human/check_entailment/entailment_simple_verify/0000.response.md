Reasoning: The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, which does not address the requirement to split the array into subarrays to minimize the total penalty. The program fails to consider the optimal way to split the array such that the sum of the penalties of these subarrays is minimized. The example provided in the original assessment correctly illustrates this issue.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:
- The problem requires splitting the array into subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
- The provided program instead calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which does not consider any splitting of the array.
- The example `+-+-+-` should result in a penalty of `0` by splitting into `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, but the program incorrectly calculates a penalty based on the counts of '+' and '-' characters.

Thus, the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
