The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of operations required to increase the median of the list `a` such that the new median is greater than the original median. If `n` is greater than 10000, it directly prints 1 followed by 16668 and stops processing further test cases.
