You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers.

The median of an array q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_k is the number p_{\lceil
\frac{k}{2} \rceil} , where p is the array q sorted in non-decreasing order.
For example, the median of the array [9, 5, 1, 2, 6] is 5 , as in the sorted
array [1, 2, 5, 6, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 is 5
, and the median of the array [9, 2, 8, 3] is 3 , as in the sorted array [2,
3, 8, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 is 3 .

You are allowed to choose an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) and increase a_i by 1
in one operation.

Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the
median of the array.

Note that the array a may not necessarily contain distinct numbers.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations
required to increase the median of the array.

Note

In the first test case, you can apply one operation to the first number and
obtain the array [3, 2, 8] , the median of this array is 3 , as it is the
number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 3, 8] . The median of the original array [2, 2, 8] is 2 , as it is
the number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 2, 8] . Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in just one operation.

In the fourth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 2, 3 and obtain the array [6, 6, 6, 4, 5] , the median of this
array is 6 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 6, 6, 6] . The median of the original array
[5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil
= 2 in the non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 5, 5, 5] . Thus, the median
increased (6 > 5 ) in three operations. It can be shown that this is the
minimum possible number of operations.

In the fifth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 3 and obtain the array [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4] , the median of this
array is 3 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 4] . The median of the original
array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2 , as it is the number at index \lceil
\frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4] .
Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in two operations. It can be shown that
this is the minimum possible number of operations.

            print(op)
        
    #State: num is unchanged; num2, case, op, a, b, median, new_median are undefined or based on the last iteration's values if the loop did not break.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of operations required to increase the median of the list `a` such that the new median is greater than the original median. If `n` is greater than 10000, it directly prints 1 followed by 16668 and stops processing further test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2` and the array `case` itself.
   - The array `a` is created by converting the input string `case` into a list of integers.
   - The array `b` is a sorted version of `a`.

2. **Median Calculation**:
   - If `num2` (the length of the array) is even, the median is considered to be the element at index `int(num2 / 2) - 1`, which is the lower middle element of the sorted array.
   - If `num2` is odd, the median is the element at index `int(num2 / 2)`, which is the middle element of the sorted array.

3. **Increasing the Median**:
   - The program initializes `new_median` to the current median `median`.
   - It then enters a loop where it increments the element at the median index in the sorted array `b` by 1 and increments the operation count `op`.
   - After each increment, it re-sorts the array `b` and updates `new_median` to the new median.
   - The loop continues until `new_median` is greater than the original median `median`.
   - Finally, it prints the number of operations `op`.

4. **Edge Cases and Bugs**:
   - The program has a hardcoded condition `if num2 > 10000` which breaks the loop and prints `1` and `16668`. This condition is not aligned with the problem description and seems to be an error.
   - The re-sorting of the array `b` after each increment is computationally expensive and not necessary. Since we are only interested in the median, we can maintain a heap or use a more efficient approach to find the next median without re-sorting the entire array.
   - The program does not handle the case where `num2` is 1 separately. If `num2` is 1, the median is the only element, and increasing it by 1 is the only operation needed.

5. **Correctness**:
   - Due to the hardcoded condition and the inefficient re-sorting, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
