In the given for loop, the loop variable is `i` and the range is defined by `num`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `num` must be at least 1. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head contains `i` and `num`.
2. The loop will execute if `num` is greater than 0.
3. The value of `t`, `n`, and `a` does not affect whether the loop executes, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the only requirement is that `num` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop and does not need to be set in advance.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `num` must be greater than 0**
