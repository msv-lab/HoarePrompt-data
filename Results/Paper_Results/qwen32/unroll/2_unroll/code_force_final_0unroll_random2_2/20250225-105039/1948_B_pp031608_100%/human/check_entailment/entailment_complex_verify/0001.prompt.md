You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; n is the integer read from input, where 2 <= n <= 50; a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99. The loop has printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each of the n iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the list can be modified by a specific rule such that all elements are in non-decreasing order. It prints 'YES' if the list can be modified accordingly, otherwise 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
We are given an array of integers, and we can repeatedly split any integer that is at least 10 into its individual digits. We need to determine if we can sort the array in non-decreasing order using this operation.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array, `m`, and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `True`. This variable will be used to determine if the current array can be sorted by the given operation.
   - The program then iterates over the array from the end to the beginning (from `m-1` to `1`).

3. **Checking the Array:**
   - For each element `arr[i]` (starting from the end of the array), it checks if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i-1]`.
   - If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i-1]`, it means the array is not sorted at this point.
   - The program then checks if splitting `arr[i-1]` into its digits and placing `arr[i]` right after the digits results in a sorted sequence.
     - This is done by creating a new list `nums` that contains the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`.
     - It then checks if `nums` is sorted.
     - If `nums` is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
     - If `nums` is sorted, it sets `arr[i-1]` to the first digit of the split number and continues checking the rest of the array.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing the array, the program prints 'YES' if `ans` is `True` and 'NO' if `ans` is `False`.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting and Sorting:**
   - The program only checks if splitting the current element and placing the next element right after it results in a sorted sequence. However, this is not sufficient to determine if the entire array can be sorted.
   - For example, consider the array `[12, 28, 5]`. The program will check if splitting `12` into `[1, 2]` and placing `28` after it results in a sorted sequence, which it does not. However, it does not consider other possibilities, such as splitting `28` into `[2, 8]` and placing `5` after it.
   
2. **Not Considering All Possible Splits:**
   - The program only considers splitting the current element and placing the next element right after it. It does not consider other possible splits or placements that might lead to a sorted array.
   - For example, in the array `[12, 28, 5]`, the correct sequence of operations would be to split `12` into `[1, 2]`, then split `28` into `[2, 8]`, and finally split `5` into `[5]`. This would result in the sorted array `[1, 2, 2, 5, 8]`.

3. **Incorrect Handling of the Array:**
   - The program modifies the array by setting `arr[i-1]` to the first digit of the split number. However, this does not correctly simulate the operation of splitting the number and placing its digits in the array.
   - The program does not correctly handle the insertion of multiple digits into the array.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by the given operation. It only checks a limited set of conditions and does not consider all possible splits and placements.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
