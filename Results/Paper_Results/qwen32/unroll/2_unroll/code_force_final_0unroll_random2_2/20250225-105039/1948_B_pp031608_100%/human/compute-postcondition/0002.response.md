To determine the output state after the loop executes all its iterations, let's break down the loop's behavior and how it affects the variables involved.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop runs `n` times, where `n` is the integer read from the input. In each iteration, the following steps occur:
1. An integer `m` is read from the input, representing the number of elements in the next list.
2. A list `arr` of `m` integers is read from the input.
3. A variable `ans` is initialized to `True`. This variable will be used to determine if the list `arr` meets a specific condition.
4. A nested loop runs from `m-1` down to `1`. In each iteration of this loop:
   - It checks if the current element `arr[i]` is less than the previous element `arr[i-1]`.
   - If `arr[i] < arr[i-1]`, it constructs a new list `nums` by concatenating the digits of `arr[i-1]` with `arr[i]`.
   - It then checks if `nums` is sorted. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False` and the loop breaks.
   - If `nums` is sorted, `arr[i-1]` is updated to the first element of `nums`.
5. After the nested loop, the code prints 'YES' if `ans` is `True` and 'NO' otherwise.

### Output State:
The output state of the loop is determined by the print statements inside the loop. Each iteration of the outer loop results in either 'YES' or 'NO' being printed, depending on the condition checked inside the nested loop.

Since the state of `t`, `n`, and `a` from the initial state are not affected by the loop, they remain unchanged. The only changes occur within the scope of each iteration of the loop, specifically in the variables `m`, `arr`, and `ans`.

### Final Output State:
The output state after the loop executes all its iterations will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each iteration of the outer loop. The state of `t`, `n`, and `a` remains the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; n is the integer read from input, where 2 <= n <= 50; a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99. The loop has printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each of the n iterations.**
