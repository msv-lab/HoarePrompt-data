Reasoning:  
The provided program is not correctly implementing the logic to determine if the array can be sorted using the described operations. The current approach is flawed in several ways:

1. **Incorrect Loop Structure**: The loop iterates from the end of the array to the beginning (`for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1)`). This approach does not correctly simulate the operation of splitting numbers and checking if the array can be sorted. It should instead consider splitting numbers from the beginning and checking if the array can be made non-decreasing.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Splits**: The code attempts to split a number and check if the resulting array (including the split number and the next element) is sorted. However, this is not sufficient to determine if the entire array can be sorted. The code should simulate the splitting process and check the order of the entire array after each potential split.

3. **Incorrect Condition for Answer**: The condition `if nums != sorted(nums):` checks if the local segment (split number and next element) is sorted, which is not the correct condition for determining if the entire array can be sorted through the described operations.

A correct approach would involve simulating the splitting of numbers and checking if the resulting array can be sorted. This would likely require a more complex algorithm, possibly involving dynamic programming or a greedy approach, to determine if the array can be sorted through the described operations.

Given the above issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
