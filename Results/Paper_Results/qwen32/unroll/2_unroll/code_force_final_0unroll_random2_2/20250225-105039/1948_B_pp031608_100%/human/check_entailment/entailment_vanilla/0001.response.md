Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
We are given an array of integers, and we can repeatedly split any integer that is at least 10 into its individual digits. We need to determine if we can sort the array in non-decreasing order using this operation.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array, `m`, and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `True`. This variable will be used to determine if the current array can be sorted by the given operation.
   - The program then iterates over the array from the end to the beginning (from `m-1` to `1`).

3. **Checking the Array:**
   - For each element `arr[i]` (starting from the end of the array), it checks if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i-1]`.
   - If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i-1]`, it means the array is not sorted at this point.
   - The program then checks if splitting `arr[i-1]` into its digits and placing `arr[i]` right after the digits results in a sorted sequence.
     - This is done by creating a new list `nums` that contains the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`.
     - It then checks if `nums` is sorted.
     - If `nums` is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
     - If `nums` is sorted, it sets `arr[i-1]` to the first digit of the split number and continues checking the rest of the array.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing the array, the program prints 'YES' if `ans` is `True` and 'NO' if `ans` is `False`.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting and Sorting:**
   - The program only checks if splitting the current element and placing the next element right after it results in a sorted sequence. However, this is not sufficient to determine if the entire array can be sorted.
   - For example, consider the array `[12, 28, 5]`. The program will check if splitting `12` into `[1, 2]` and placing `28` after it results in a sorted sequence, which it does not. However, it does not consider other possibilities, such as splitting `28` into `[2, 8]` and placing `5` after it.
   
2. **Not Considering All Possible Splits:**
   - The program only considers splitting the current element and placing the next element right after it. It does not consider other possible splits or placements that might lead to a sorted array.
   - For example, in the array `[12, 28, 5]`, the correct sequence of operations would be to split `12` into `[1, 2]`, then split `28` into `[2, 8]`, and finally split `5` into `[5]`. This would result in the sorted array `[1, 2, 2, 5, 8]`.

3. **Incorrect Handling of the Array:**
   - The program modifies the array by setting `arr[i-1]` to the first digit of the split number. However, this does not correctly simulate the operation of splitting the number and placing its digits in the array.
   - The program does not correctly handle the insertion of multiple digits into the array.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by the given operation. It only checks a limited set of conditions and does not consider all possible splits and placements.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
