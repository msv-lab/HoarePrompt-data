### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its correctness in detail:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n` and initializes the variables `ax`, `bx`, and `cx`:
     - `ax` is initialized to a large value (1000000000 + 7), representing the upper bound for `k`.
     - `bx` is initialized to -1, representing the lower bound for `k`.
     - `cx` is a set that will store the values of `k` that `k` must not be equal to.

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, the program reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
   - If `a == 1`, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of its current value and `x` (setting the lower bound).
   - If `a == 2`, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and `x` (setting the upper bound).
   - If `a == 3`, it adds `x` to the set `cx` (values that `k` must not be equal to).

3. **Checking for Valid Bounds:**
   - After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx` (the lower bound) is greater than or equal to `ax` (the upper bound). If so, it means there are no valid integers `k` that can satisfy all constraints, and it appends `0` to the result list `r`.

4. **Counting Valid Integers:**
   - If `bx < ax`, the program calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the count of integers in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]` from the total number of integers in that range (`ax - bx + 1`). The result is then appended to the result list `r`.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program prints the results for each test case, one per line.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic for determining the number of valid integers `k` based on the given constraints. The handling of lower and upper bounds and the exclusion of specific values is done accurately. The program also correctly handles the edge cases where no valid integers exist.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
