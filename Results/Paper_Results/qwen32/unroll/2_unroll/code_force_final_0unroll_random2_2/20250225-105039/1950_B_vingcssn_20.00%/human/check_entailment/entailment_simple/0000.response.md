Reasoning:  
The provided program is designed to handle up to 4 specific cases (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) by printing predefined patterns for each case. However, the problem statement specifies that the input value `n` can be up to 20. The current implementation does not handle cases where `n` is greater than 4, as it only includes hardcoded solutions for `n` values of 1, 2, 3, and 4. For `n` values greater than 4, the program outputs "No esta en el rango" (which means "Not in the range"), which is not a valid output according to the problem description.

To be correct, the program should dynamically generate the checkerboard pattern for any value of `n` within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). Since the current implementation fails to do so, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
