You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program seems to be attempting to solve the problem by counting the number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using the given vertices of the polygon. However, the logic in the program is flawed and does not correctly account for all possible cases.

Let's break down the problem and the program's logic:

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Vertices and Diagonals**: We have a polygon with `n` vertices. Some vertices (`x` vertices) are already chosen, and we can choose up to `y` more vertices (in this version, `y = 0`).
2. **Objective**: Maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the chosen vertices.

### Program Logic:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases `T`. For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` followed by the list of `x` chosen vertices.
2. **Sorting**: The chosen vertices are sorted.
3. **Counting Triangles**:
   - It iterates through the sorted list of chosen vertices and checks the gaps between consecutive vertices.
   - If the gap between two consecutive vertices is exactly 1, it increments the count of triangles.
   - It also checks the gap between the last vertex and the first vertex (considering the polygon is circular).
4. **Output**: The program outputs the count of triangles plus `x - 2`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Triangle Formation**: The program only counts gaps of 1 between vertices, which implies that it only considers triangles where two vertices are adjacent and the third vertex is the next one in the sequence. This is not the only way to form triangles.
2. **Non-Adjacent Vertices**: The program does not consider cases where triangles can be formed using non-adjacent vertices. For example, in a polygon with vertices 1, 3, and 5 chosen, the vertices 1, 3, and 5 can form a triangle, but the program will not count this because the gaps are not 1.
3. **Circular Nature**: While the program does consider the gap between the last and first vertex, it does not handle the circular nature of the polygon correctly for all cases.
4. **Maximizing Triangles**: The program does not attempt to maximize the number of triangles by considering all possible combinations of chosen vertices.

### Counterexample:
Consider the test case:
```
3
8 4 0
1 6 2 5
```
The program will output `2` for this case, but the correct answer is `2`. However, let's consider another test case:
```
5 3 0
1 3 5
```
The program will output `0` for this case, but the correct answer is `1` because the vertices 1, 3, and 5 can form a triangle.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly account for all possible ways to form triangles and does not maximize the number of triangles in all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
