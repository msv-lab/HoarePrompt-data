Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the gaps between the integers in the list and the number of integers. Specifically, it counts the number of gaps of size 1 between the integers in the sorted list and adds this count to `x - 2`, then prints the result.**
