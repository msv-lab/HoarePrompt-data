The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `T`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Given the initial state, `T` is already defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `T` to ensure the loop executes. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that `y` = 0; the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
