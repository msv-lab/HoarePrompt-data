The `print('draw')` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string `'draw'`. The initial state provides information about various variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions affect the execution of this specific print statement. The string `'draw'` is hardcoded and will be printed as is.

Output: **draw**
