Postcondition: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)` after adjusting `y1` based on the condition. `h` and `w` are positive integers such that 1 <= h <= 10^6 and 1 <= w <= 10^9; `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` are positive integers such that 1 <= x_a, x_b <= h and 1 <= y_a, y_b <= w; `r` is a list of integers read from input; `n` is `r[0]`; `m` is `r[1]`; `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + a`; `x2` is `r[4] - a`; `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`; `y1` is adjusted by `a` to either `y1 - a` if `y2 <= y1` or `y1 + a` if `y2 > y1`; `y2` is adjusted to either 1 if `y2 <= y1` or `m` if `y2 > y1`; `b` is `x2 - x1`; `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`; `c` is `y1 - 1` if `y2 <= y1` or `m - y1` if `y2 > y1`. Additionally, `b // 2 > a`, `abs(x2 - c) >= x1 + c`, `1 <= y1 <= m`, and `1 <= x1 <= n`.**
