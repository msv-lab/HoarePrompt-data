The task is to determine what will be printed by the `print('draw')` statement based on the provided initial state.

Let's analyze the given conditions and variables:

1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t` is defined as `abs(y2 - 1)` if `y2 >= y1`, otherwise `abs(y2 - m)`.
   - `h` and `w` are positive integers within specified ranges.
   - `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` are positive integers within specified ranges.
   - `r` is a list of integers read from input.
   - `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + a`, `y1` is `1` if `y2 >= y1` otherwise `y1` is `m`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `r[5]`.
   - `x2 > x1` and `(x2 - x1)` is even.
   - `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
   - `a` is `y1 - 1` if `y2 >= y1` otherwise `a` is `m - y1`.
   - `b` is `x2 - x1`.
   - `c` is `y2 - 1` if `y2 >= y1` otherwise `c` is `m - y2`.
   - At least one of the conditions `b // 2 <= a`, `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c`, `y1 < 1`, `y1 > m`, `x1 < 1`, `x1 > n` is true.

2. **The Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print('draw')` simply prints the string `'draw'`.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - The print statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `a`, `b`, or `c`.
   - The print statement is straightforward and will output the string `'draw'` regardless of the values of the variables.

Given the above analysis, the output of the print statement is simply the string `'draw'`.

Output: **draw**
