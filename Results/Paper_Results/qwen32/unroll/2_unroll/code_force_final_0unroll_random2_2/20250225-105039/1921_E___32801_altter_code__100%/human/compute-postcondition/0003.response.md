The `print('draw')` statement in the given Python code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'draw'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes various variables (`t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`) and their constraints.
2. The `print` statement is `print('draw')`, which is a direct print of the string `'draw'`.
3. None of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state affect the output of this `print` statement.

Thus, the output will be the string `'draw'`.

Output: **draw**
