Let's analyze the loop and how it processes the input to determine the final output state.

The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an `n x n` grid. The code then checks each row of the grid to determine if it contains exactly one '1' or more than one '1'. If a row contains exactly one '1', it sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'. If a row contains more than one '1', it sets `b` to 'SQUARE'. After processing all rows, it prints 'TRIANGLE' if `a` is not zero (which means a row with exactly one '1' was found), otherwise, it prints 'SQUARE'.

Given the problem constraints, the grid contains exactly one shape (either a triangle or a square) made up of '1's, and the shape is larger than 1x1. Therefore, it is impossible for any row to contain exactly one '1' because the shape is larger than 1x1. This means `a` will never be set to 'TRIANGLE'. Instead, `b` will be set to 'SQUARE' if any row contains more than one '1', which will always be the case for a shape larger than 1x1.

Thus, the output of each test case will be 'SQUARE'. Since there are `t` test cases, the output will consist of 'SQUARE' printed `t` times.

Output State: **t test cases each resulting in the output 'SQUARE'.**
