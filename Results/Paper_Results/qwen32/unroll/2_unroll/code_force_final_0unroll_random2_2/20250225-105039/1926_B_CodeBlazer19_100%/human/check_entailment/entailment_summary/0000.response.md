Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape is a triangle or a square. The current logic only checks if there is a row with exactly one '1' or more than one '1'. This is insufficient to correctly identify the shapes as defined in the problem statement.

For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row should follow a specific pattern: the i-th row should have 2*i - 1 '1's, and these '1's should be centered in the row. For an upside-down triangle, the pattern is reversed. The program does not check for these patterns.

For a square, the number of '1's in each row should be the same and greater than 1, and these '1's should be positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid. The program does not check for this pattern either.

The program incorrectly identifies the shape based on the first row that has a single '1' or more than one '1', which does not align with the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
