The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it iterates over the range of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, which already ensures that the loop can execute. Therefore, there is no need to adjust `t` or introduce any other variables from the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `i` is 0**
