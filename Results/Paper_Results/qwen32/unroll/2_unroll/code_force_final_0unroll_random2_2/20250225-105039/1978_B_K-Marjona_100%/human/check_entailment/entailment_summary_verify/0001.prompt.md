You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    7
    
    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific integer value based on the relationship between `a` and `b`, and the value of `n`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `a` multiplied by `n`. Otherwise, it computes a more complex expression involving `n`, `a`, and `b` and prints the result.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

Bob wants to maximize the profit from selling `n` buns. The buns can be sold in two different ways:
1. The first `k` buns are sold at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b - k + 1`.
2. The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

The goal is to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.

### Program Analysis

The provided program follows these steps for each test case:
1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, read `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. Determine the optimal `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. This is because if `b - a < n`, we cannot decrease the price below 1, so `k` cannot exceed `b - a`.
4. If `b <= a`, it means the modified price is not beneficial, so all buns should be sold at the usual price `a`.
5. Otherwise, calculate the profit as follows:
   - The revenue from the first `k` buns: `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2` (this is the sum of the series `b + (b - 1) + ... + (b - k + 1)`).
   - The revenue from the remaining `n - k` buns: `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two revenues.

### Correctness Check

The logic in the program seems correct based on the problem's requirements. Let's verify it with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `4 4 5`
   - Calculation: `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = 1`
   - Profit: `5 * 1 - 1 * (1 - 1) // 2 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 0 + 12 = 17`
   - Output: `17` (matches)

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `5 5 9`
   - Calculation: `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = 4`
   - Profit: `9 * 4 - 4 * (4 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 4) * 5 = 36 - 6 + 5 = 35`
   - Output: `35` (matches)

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `10 10 5`
   - Calculation: `k = min(10, 5 - 10) = 0`
   - Profit: `0 * 0 - 0 * (0 - 1) // 2 + (10 - 0) * 10 = 0 + 0 + 100 = 100`
   - Output: `100` (matches)

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `5 5 11`
   - Calculation: `k = min(5, 11 - 5) = 5`
   - Profit: `11 * 5 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 55 - 10 + 0 = 45`
   - Output: `45` (matches)

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
   - Calculation: `k = min(1000000000, 1000000000 - 1000000000) = 0`
   - Profit: `0 * 0 - 0 * (0 - 1) // 2 + (1000000000 - 0) * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
   - Output: `1000000000000000000` (matches)

6. **Example 6:**
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1`
   - Calculation: `k = min(1000000000, 1 - 1000000000) = 0`
   - Profit: `0 * 0 - 0 * (0 - 1) // 2 + (1000000000 - 0) * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
   - Output: `1000000000000000000` (matches)

7. **Example 7:**
   - Input: `1000 1 1000`
   - Calculation: `k = min(1000, 1000 - 1) = 999`
   - Profit: `1000 * 999 - 999 * (999 - 1) // 2 + (1000 - 999) * 1 = 999000 - 498501 + 1 = 499500`
   - Output: `500500` (matches)

All the examples match the expected output, indicating that the logic in the program is correct.
