The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific integer value based on the relationship between `a` and `b`, and the value of `n`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `a` multiplied by `n`. Otherwise, it computes a more complex expression involving `n`, `a`, and `b` and prints the result.
