To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's analyze the code snippet provided.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs for a number of times equal to the number of test cases.
2. **Inner Logic**:
   - **Input Reading**: For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers.
   - **Counting Occurrences**: It initializes a list `cnt` of size `n + 1` to zero. Then, it iterates over the list `a` and increments the count of each integer in `cnt`.
   - **Calculating Answer**: It calculates the answer by summing up the maximum of zero and the count minus one for each element in `cnt`. This essentially counts how many numbers appear more than once.
   - **Output**: It prints the calculated answer for each test case.

### Output State:
After all the iterations, the state of the variables in the loop head and body will be as follows:
- The outer loop counter will be exhausted (i.e., all test cases will be processed).
- The variables `n`, `a`, `cnt`, and `ans` will be in their final state corresponding to the last test case processed.
- Since each test case is independent and the results are printed immediately after processing each test case, the final state of these variables will reflect the last test case processed.

### Final Output State:
The output state will consist of the printed results for each test case, but in terms of variable states at the end of the loop:
- `n` will be the number of cards in the last test case.
- `a` will be the list of integers in the last test case.
- `cnt` will be the count of occurrences of each integer in the last test case.
- `ans` will be the final answer for the last test case, which is the sum of the excess counts of each integer (if any).

However, since the question asks for the output state in terms of what is printed, we can describe it as the series of answers for each test case.

### Final Answer:
Output State: **The output state consists of the printed answers for each test case, which are the sums of the excess counts of each integer in their respective test cases.**
