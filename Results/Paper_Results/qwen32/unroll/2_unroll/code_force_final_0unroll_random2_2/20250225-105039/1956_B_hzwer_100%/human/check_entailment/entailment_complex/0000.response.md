### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get in a card game where you and Nene each have `n` cards, and each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice in the deck. Points are awarded when you place a card on the table that has already been placed by either player. Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

The provided program calculates the maximum number of points you can get by counting how many cards in your hand appear more than once. This is because if a card appears more than once in your hand, you can place the second occurrence of that card on the table after the first occurrence has already been placed, thus earning a point.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand.

2. **Counting Card Occurrences**: It initializes a list `cnt` of size `n+1` to count the occurrences of each card in your hand.

3. **Calculating Points**: It iterates over the list `cnt` and sums up the excess counts (i.e., `max(0, x - 1)` for each count `x` in `cnt`). This sum represents the maximum number of points you can get because each excess count corresponds to a card that can be placed on the table after its first occurrence, earning you a point.

4. **Output**: For each test case, it prints the calculated sum of points.

The logic of the program is sound because it correctly identifies the cards that can be used to earn points and sums up the potential points based on the excess counts.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally, given the constraints and the behavior of Nene.
