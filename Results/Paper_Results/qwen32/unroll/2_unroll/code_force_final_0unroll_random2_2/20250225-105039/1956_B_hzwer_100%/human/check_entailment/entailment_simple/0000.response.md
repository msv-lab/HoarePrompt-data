### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of points you can get, assuming both you and Nene play optimally. The key insight is that you gain a point if you play a card that already has a matching card on the table. Since Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours, the best strategy for you is to play cards that have a matching card in your hand but are not yet on the table, to maximize the chances of Nene not being able to score points from those cards.

The provided program calculates the maximum number of points you can get by counting how many times each card appears in your hand and summing up the excess counts (i.e., the number of times a card appears more than once minus one). This logic is correct because for each card that appears more than once in your hand, you can place one of them on the table, and if Nene doesn't play the matching card in her turn, you can play the second one and score a point.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand.
2. **Counting Cards**: It initializes a count array `cnt` to count the occurrences of each card.
3. **Calculating Points**: For each card count `x` in `cnt`, it adds `max(0, x - 1)` to the answer `ans`. This means that for each card that appears more than once, you can score a point by playing the second occurrence (since the first occurrence will be on the table by the time you play the second one).
4. **Output**: It prints the final answer for each test case.

The program correctly implements this logic and handles the constraints provided in the problem description.

### Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can get under the assumption that both you and Nene play optimally.
