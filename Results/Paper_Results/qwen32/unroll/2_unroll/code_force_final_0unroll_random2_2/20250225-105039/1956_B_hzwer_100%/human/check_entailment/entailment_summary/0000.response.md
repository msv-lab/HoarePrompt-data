Reasoning:
The program calculates the maximum number of points you can get by counting how many cards you have more than once. This is because, for each card you have more than once, you can place one of the cards on the table, and then on your next turn, you can place the other card and receive a point since the card will already be on the table.

The program correctly identifies that for each integer `x` in your hand, if it appears more than once (`cnt[x] > 1`), you can get `cnt[x] - 1` points from those cards. This is because the first card you place does not earn you a point, but each subsequent card does.

The program then sums these values for all integers in the range from 1 to `n` and prints the result for each test case. This logic aligns with the problem's requirement to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally.

The execution summary confirms that the program processes each test case as described, calculating the sum of excess counts for each integer in the list and printing this sum, which is the correct approach to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
