Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program calculates the number of pairs of cards in the player's hand, which is not the correct approach to determine the maximum number of points the player can get given Nene's optimal play.

To solve the problem, we need to simulate the game considering Nene's optimal strategy. Here's a brief outline of the correct approach:

1. Count the occurrences of each card in both players' hands.
2. Use a strategy that maximizes the player's points while accounting for Nene's optimal play.
3. The player should aim to play cards that will minimize Nene's points and maximize their own points.

The provided program simply counts the number of pairs in the player's hand, which does not consider the alternating turns and the strategic play of Nene. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem.
