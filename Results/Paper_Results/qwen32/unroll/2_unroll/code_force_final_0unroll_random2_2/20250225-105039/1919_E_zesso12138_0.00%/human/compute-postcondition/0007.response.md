To determine the output state after the loop completes, we need to analyze the loop's effect on the variables:

1. **Loop Iterations**: The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.
2. **Variables Updated in Each Iteration**:
   - `n` is reassigned to the integer value of `data[index]` at the start of each iteration.
   - `index` is incremented by 1 after reading `n`.
   - `p` is reassigned to a list of integers from `data` starting at `index` and extending for `n` elements.
   - `index` is incremented by `n` after reading `p`.
   - `result` is computed by calling `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `results` is appended with `result`.

3. **Other Variables**:
   - `t`, `data`, and `input` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
   - `index` will be updated after each iteration but will reflect the final position after all iterations.

After the loop completes, the following will be the state of the variables:
- `n` will hold the value from the last iteration.
- `p` will hold the list of integers from the last iteration.
- `index` will be at the position after the last `p` was read.
- `t` remains the same as it was initially.
- `data` remains the same as it was initially.
- `input` remains the same as it was initially.
- `results` will contain the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value from the last iteration, `p` is the list of integers from the last iteration, `index` is the position after the last `p` was read, `t` is the initial integer value, `data` is the initial list of strings, `input` is reassigned to `sys.stdin.read`, and `results` is a list of results from `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration.**
