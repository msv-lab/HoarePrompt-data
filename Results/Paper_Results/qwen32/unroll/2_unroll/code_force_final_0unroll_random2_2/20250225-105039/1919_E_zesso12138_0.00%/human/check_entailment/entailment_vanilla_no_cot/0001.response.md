### Reasoning:

The given problem requires us to count the number of initial arrays `a` such that the sorted prefix sums of `a` match the given sorted prefix sums `p`.

The provided program uses dynamic programming (DP) to solve this problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and whether it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Dynamic Programming Setup:**
   - The program initializes a DP array `dp` of size `2 * n + 1` with an offset of `n`. This offset is used to handle negative indices in the DP array since the prefix sums can range from `-n` to `n`.
   - The `dp` array is initialized such that `dp[offset] = 1`, representing the starting point where the prefix sum is `0`.

2. **DP Transition:**
   - For each element in the array, the program transitions the DP state by considering the two possible values for the next element of `a`: `1` and `-1`.
   - If the current prefix sum is `j`, the next prefix sum can be `j + 1` (if the next element is `1`) or `j - 1` (if the next element is `-1`).
   - The program updates the `new_dp` array accordingly, taking care to handle the modulo operation to prevent overflow.

3. **Final Sum Calculation:**
   - After processing all elements, the program calculates the final sum of the prefix sums, which is `p[-1] + offset`.
   - The result is the value in the `dp` array at this final sum index, representing the number of ways to achieve the given sorted prefix sums.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases from the input, processes each one using the `func_1` function, and stores the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of DP Approach:**
  - The DP approach correctly models the problem by considering all possible sequences of `1` and `-1` and their resulting prefix sums.
  - The use of an offset in the DP array allows the program to handle negative prefix sums correctly.
  - The modulo operation ensures that the results fit within the required constraints.

- **Handling of Input and Output:**
  - The program correctly reads input for multiple test cases and processes each one independently.
  - It outputs the results in the required format.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the required solution using dynamic programming and handles the input/output as specified in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
