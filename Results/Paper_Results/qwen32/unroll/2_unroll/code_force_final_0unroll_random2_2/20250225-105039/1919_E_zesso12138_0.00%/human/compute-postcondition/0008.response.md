In the provided for loop:

```python
for res in results:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `res`, which iterates over the elements in the `results` list. To ensure that the loop can execute, the `results` list must contain at least one element. The other variables (`n`, `p`, `index`, `t`, `data`, `input`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to affect the loop's execution directly.

Therefore, to make sure the loop executes, we need to ensure that `results` has at least one element.

State: **`n` is the integer value from the last iteration, `p` is the list of integers from the last iteration, `index` is the position after the last `p` was read, `t` is the initial integer value, `data` is the initial list of strings, `input` is reassigned to `sys.stdin.read`, and `results` is a list of results from `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration with at least one element**.
