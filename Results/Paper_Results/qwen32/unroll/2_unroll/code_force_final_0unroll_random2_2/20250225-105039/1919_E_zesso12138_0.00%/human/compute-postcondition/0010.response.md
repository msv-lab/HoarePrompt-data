Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array `a`, and `p`, a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a`. The function returns a list `a` of `n` integers that corresponds to the original array from which the prefix sums were derived.**
