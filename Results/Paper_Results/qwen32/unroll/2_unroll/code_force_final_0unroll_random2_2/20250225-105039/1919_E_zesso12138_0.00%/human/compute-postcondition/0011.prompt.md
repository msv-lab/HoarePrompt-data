You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array a, and p is a list of n integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array a.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(n, p)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: `n` is the integer value from the last iteration, `p` is the list of integers from the last iteration, `index` is the position after the last `p` was read, `t` is the initial integer value, `data` is the initial list of strings, `input` is reassigned to `sys.stdin.read`, and `results` is a list of results from `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration.
    for res in results:
        print(res)
        
    #State: `n` is the integer value from the last iteration, `p` is the list of integers from the last iteration, `index` is the position after the last `p` was read, `t` is the initial integer value, `data` is the initial list of strings, `input` is reassigned to `sys.stdin.read`, and `results` is a list of results from `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration. The elements of `results` have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array `a`, and `p`, a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a`. The function returns a list `a` of `n` integers that corresponds to the original array from which the prefix sums were derived.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
