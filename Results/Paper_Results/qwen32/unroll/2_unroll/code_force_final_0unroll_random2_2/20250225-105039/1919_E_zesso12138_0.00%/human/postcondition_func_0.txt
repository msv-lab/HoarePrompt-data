The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `n` and a list of integers `p` of length `n` as input. It computes and returns a specific value from a dynamic programming array `dp` based on the input parameters. The returned value is `dp[dp[-1] + offset]`, where `offset` is a predefined value within the function.
