The code snippet `l.sort()` sorts the list `l` in ascending order. The minimum value in the list `l` remains the same, and the sorted list `l` will have its elements arranged from the smallest to the largest. The variables `n`, `c`, `d`, `a`, and `li` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a sorted list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^9; `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`; `li` is a sorted list of n^2 integers where each integer is calculated as a + k * c + d * h for k, h in the range from 0 to n-1.**
