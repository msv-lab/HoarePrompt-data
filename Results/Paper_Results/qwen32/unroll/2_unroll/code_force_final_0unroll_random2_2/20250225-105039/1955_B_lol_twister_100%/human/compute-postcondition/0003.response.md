To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to understand what the loop does. The loop iterates over a 2D grid defined by the range of `n` for both dimensions. For each position `(k, h)` in the grid, it calculates a value using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` and appends this value to the list `li`.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:
1. The loop runs `n` times for `k` and `n` times for `h`, resulting in `n * n` iterations.
2. For each iteration, a value is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` and appended to `li`.
3. The value of `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, and `c` and `d` are given integers.
4. The list `li` is initially empty and will be filled with the calculated values.

After the loop completes, `li` will contain `n * n` elements, each calculated using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for each pair `(k, h)` in the range from `0` to `n-1`.

Therefore, the output state will be:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, and `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^9; `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`; `li` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer is calculated as a + k * c + d * h for k, h in the range from 0 to n-1.**
