### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to verify its correctness.

The problem statement describes a progressive square where each element \( a_{i,j} \) is calculated using the formula:
\[ a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d \]
where \( a_{1,1} \) is the top-left element of the matrix, and \( c \) and \( d \) are given constants.

The program reads multiple test cases, and for each test case, it performs the following steps:
1. Reads the size of the matrix \( n \), and constants \( c \) and \( d \).
2. Reads the list of \( n^2 \) integers \( l \).
3. Calls the function `func_1(n, c, d, l)` to check if the list can be rearranged to form the progressive square.

The function `func_1` performs the following steps:
1. Finds the minimum value \( a \) in the list \( l \), which is assumed to be \( a_{1,1} \).
2. Constructs a list \( li \) of expected values using the formula \( a + k \cdot c + d \cdot h \) for \( k, h \) in the range from 0 to \( n-1 \).
3. Sorts both the provided list \( l \) and the constructed list \( li \).
4. Compares the sorted lists. If they are equal, it returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'.

### Analysis of Annotations

The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- Before the function call, the variables \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \) are correctly set, and the list \( l \) contains the \( n^2 \) integers.
- Inside the function, the minimum value \( a \) is correctly identified.
- The list \( li \) is correctly constructed using the formula \( a + k \cdot c + d \cdot h \).
- Both lists \( l \) and \( li \) are sorted and compared correctly.

### Verification

The program's logic is sound:
- The assumption that the smallest value in the list \( l \) is \( a_{1,1} \) is valid because \( a_{1,1} \) is the smallest value in the progressive square.
- The construction of the list \( li \) using the formula \( a + k \cdot c + d \cdot h \) correctly generates the elements of the progressive square.
- Sorting both lists and comparing them ensures that the provided list can be rearranged to form the progressive square.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given list can form a progressive square according to the provided rules. Therefore, the program is correct.
