Functionality: **The function `func_1` checks if a given list `l` of `n^2` integers can be rearranged to match a specific sequence generated by starting from the minimum value in `l` and incrementing by `c` and `d` in a grid-like fashion. It returns 'yes' if the list can be rearranged to match this sequence, otherwise it returns 'no'.**
