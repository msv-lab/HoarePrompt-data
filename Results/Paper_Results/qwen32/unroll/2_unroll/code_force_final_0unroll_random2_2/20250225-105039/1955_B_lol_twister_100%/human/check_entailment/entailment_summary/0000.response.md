### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine if the given list of integers `l` can be rearranged to form a specific sequence that represents a progressive square matrix. The progressive square matrix is constructed based on the values `n`, `c`, and `d` as follows:
- The matrix starts with a minimum value `a` (which is the minimum value in the list `l`).
- The value at position `(k, h)` in the matrix is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`.

The program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n`, `c`, and `d`.
3. It reads the list `l` of `n^2` integers.
4. It calls the function `func_1` with `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l`.
5. Inside `func_1`, it finds the minimum value `a` in `l`.
6. It constructs the expected sequence `li` based on the rules for the progressive square.
7. It sorts both `li` and `l`.
8. It compares the sorted lists and returns 'yes' if they match, otherwise it returns 'no'.

The logic in `func_1` correctly follows the rules for constructing the progressive square and checks if the given list `l` can be rearranged to match this sequence. The sorting step ensures that the comparison is done correctly regardless of the initial order of elements in `l`.
