Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a sorted list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a sorted list of n^2 integers where each integer is calculated as a + k * c + d * h for k, h in the range from 0 to n-1, and `l` is equal to `li`.**
