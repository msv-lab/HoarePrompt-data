### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description and the provided program to ensure its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- A progressive square of size \( n \times n \) is constructed using the formula:
  - \( a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d \)
- Given \( n \), \( c \), \( d \), and a list of \( n^2 \) integers, determine if the list can be rearranged to form such a progressive square.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( c \), \( d \), and the list \( l \) of \( n^2 \) integers.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the smallest element in the list \( l \) and assign it to \( a \). This is assumed to be \( a_{1,1} \).
   - **Step 2**: Construct a list \( li \) with the expected values of the progressive square using the formula \( a + k \cdot c + d \cdot h \) for \( k, h \) in the range from \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \).
   - **Step 3**: Sort both the provided list \( l \) and the constructed list \( li \).
   - **Step 4**: Compare the sorted lists. If they are equal, return 'yes'; otherwise, return 'no'.

#### Annotations and State Analysis:
- **State Before Function Call**: The program receives valid inputs according to the problem constraints.
- **State Inside Function**:
  - `a` is correctly identified as the smallest element in the list \( l \).
  - `li` is constructed using the correct formula \( a + k \cdot c + d \cdot h \) for all \( k, h \) in the range \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \).
  - Both `l` and `li` are sorted and compared.

#### Challenges to the Original Assessment:
- **Choice of \( a \)**: The program assumes that the smallest element in the list \( l \) is \( a_{1,1} \). This assumption is valid because the problem guarantees that there exists exactly one progressive square for given \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \). Therefore, the smallest element in the list must be \( a_{1,1} \).
- **Correctness of Formula**: The formula used to construct `li` is correct and matches the problem's definition of the progressive square.
- **Sorting and Comparison**: Sorting both lists and comparing them ensures that the provided list can be rearranged to form the progressive square.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given list can form a progressive square according to the provided rules. The annotations and state analysis confirm that the program behaves as expected.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
