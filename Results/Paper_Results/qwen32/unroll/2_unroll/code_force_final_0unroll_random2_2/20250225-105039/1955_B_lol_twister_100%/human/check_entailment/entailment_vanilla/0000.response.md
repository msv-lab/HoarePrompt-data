Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Understanding the Problem

The problem involves constructing a progressive square of size \( n \times n \) using the parameters \( a_{1,1} \), \( c \), and \( d \). The construction rules are:
- The top-left element is \( a_{1,1} \).
- The element at position \( (i, j) \) in the matrix is given by the formula: \( a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d \).

The task is to determine if a given list of \( n^2 \) integers can be rearranged to form such a progressive square for the given \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \).

### Analyzing the Program

The program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases \( t \).
2. For each test case:
   - It reads \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \).
   - It reads the list of \( n^2 \) integers \( l \).
   - It calls the function `func_1(n, c, d, l)` to check if the list can form a progressive square.
3. The function `func_1`:
   - Determines the smallest element \( a \) in the list \( l \), which is assumed to be \( a_{1,1} \).
   - Constructs a new list \( li \) with the expected values of the progressive square using the formula \( a + k \cdot c + d \cdot h \).
   - Sorts both the provided list \( l \) and the constructed list \( li \).
   - Compares the sorted lists. If they are equal, it returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'.

### Verification

- The program correctly identifies the smallest element \( a \) in the list \( l \) as \( a_{1,1} \).
- It constructs the progressive square using the formula \( a + k \cdot c + d \cdot h \) for all \( k \) and \( h \) in the range \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \).
- It sorts both lists and compares them to check if they match, which ensures that the provided list can be rearranged to form the progressive square.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given list can form a progressive square according to the provided rules. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
