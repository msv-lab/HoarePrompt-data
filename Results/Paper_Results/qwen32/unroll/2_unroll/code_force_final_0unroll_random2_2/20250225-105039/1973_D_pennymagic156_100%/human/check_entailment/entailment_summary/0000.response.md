### Reasoning:

The provided code is designed to solve the interactive problem as described. Let's break down the logic and verify if it meets the requirements.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_3` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, which represent the length of the array and the number of subarrays, respectively.

2. **Finding the Maximum Possible `m`:**
   - The code initializes `v` to 1.
   - It then iterates from `n` down to 1, making queries to find the smallest `r` such that `f(1, r) = i * n`. This effectively checks if the maximum possible value of `m` is `i * n` by querying the function `f` with `l = 1` and `x = i * n`.
   - If `r` equals `n`, it means `f(1, n) = i * n`, and `v` is set to `i`. This loop finds the maximum possible value of `m` that could be the answer.

3. **Checking for Valid `m`:**
   - The code then iterates from `1` to `n // k + 1` (inclusive) to check if `m = i * v` can be the value such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays where each subarray has `f(l, r) = m`.
   - For each `i`, it sets `cnt` to `k` and `l` to `1`. It then makes queries to find the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = i * v` and updates `l` to `r + 1` after each query.
   - If `cnt` reaches 0 and `l` is `n + 1`, it means the array can be split into `k` subarrays with `f(l, r) = m`, and the code prints `! {i * v}`.
   - If no such `m` is found, it prints `! -1`.

### Correctness Analysis:

The algorithm follows a systematic approach to determine the largest `m` that satisfies the conditions. Here are the key points:

- **Initialization and Querying:** The code correctly initializes `v` and iterates from `n` down to 1 to find the maximum possible value of `m`.
- **Validation:** The code then checks if the found `m` can be used to split the array into `k` subarrays, making the necessary queries to validate this.
- **Output:** It correctly prints the result based on whether a valid `m` is found.

The code ensures that it does not exceed the query limit and handles the interaction as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem by following the described logic and ensuring all conditions are met.

**Correctness:** **True**
