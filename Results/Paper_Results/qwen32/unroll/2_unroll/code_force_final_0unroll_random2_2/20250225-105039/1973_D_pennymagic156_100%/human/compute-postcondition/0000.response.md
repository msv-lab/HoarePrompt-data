The code snippet assigns the values returned by `func_3()` to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer representing the length of a hidden array, and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n.

After executing the code, the values of `n` and `k` will be whatever `func_3()` returns. The precondition that `k` must be between 1 and `n` (inclusive) will still hold true if `func_3()` adheres to this constraint.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `k` being between 1 and `n` (inclusive).**
