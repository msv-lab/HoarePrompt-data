Functionality: **The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It interacts with other functions (`func_3` and `func_2`) to perform a series of operations involving queries and responses, ultimately printing either the value `i * v` if a certain condition is met or `-1` if it is not. The function returns nothing (None).**
