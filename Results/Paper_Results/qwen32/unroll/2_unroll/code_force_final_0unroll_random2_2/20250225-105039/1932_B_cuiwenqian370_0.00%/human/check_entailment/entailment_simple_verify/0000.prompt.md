You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The code is structured to handle a different problem, specifically one involving a path with '@' and '*' characters, which is not related to the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur.

The problem requires us to determine the year in which all n signs will occur sequentially, given their periodicities. The provided code, however, appears to be a solution for a different problem, possibly related to a sequence of characters and counting certain patterns.

Let's analyze why the provided code is incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function seems to be designed to count the maximum number of '@' characters in a sequence, considering certain constraints ('*').
   - It does not incorporate the logic required to find the year in which each sign occurs based on its periodicity.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` with a path (which is not defined in the problem context) and collects results.
   - The results are then printed, but they do not correspond to the years in which the n-th sign occurs.

To solve the given problem, the correct approach would involve iterating through each test case, and for each sign, finding the next occurrence year based on its periodicity, starting from the year after the previous sign occurred.

Here's a correct implementation for the given problem:

```python
def find_apocalypse_year(n, periods):
    current_year = 0
    for period in periods:
        # Find the next occurrence of the sign after the current_year
        next_occurrence = ((current_year // period) + 1) * period
        current_year = next_occurrence
    return current_year

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        periods = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        results.append(find_apocalypse_year(n, periods))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This implementation correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur for each test case based on the periodicities provided.
