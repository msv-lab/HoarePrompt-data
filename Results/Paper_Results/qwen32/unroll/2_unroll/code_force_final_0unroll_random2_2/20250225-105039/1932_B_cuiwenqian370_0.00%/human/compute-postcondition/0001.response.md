The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and assigns the resulting list of strings to the variable `data`. The initial state specifies that `path` is a string of space-separated integers, so after the execution of the code, `data` will be a list of these integers as strings.

Output State: **`path` is a string of space-separated integers representing the periodicities of the signs, `n` is an integer representing the number of signs such that 1 <= n <= 100, `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings where each string is an integer from `path`.**
