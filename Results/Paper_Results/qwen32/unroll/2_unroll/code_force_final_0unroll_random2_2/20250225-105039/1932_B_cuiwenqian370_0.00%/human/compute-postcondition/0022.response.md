Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `path`, which is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', and the length of `path` is a non-negative integer `n`. The function returns 0 if the path contains no '@' characters or only '*' characters. Otherwise, it returns the maximum number of '@' characters encountered up to any position in the path, excluding positions marked as impossible ('*').**
