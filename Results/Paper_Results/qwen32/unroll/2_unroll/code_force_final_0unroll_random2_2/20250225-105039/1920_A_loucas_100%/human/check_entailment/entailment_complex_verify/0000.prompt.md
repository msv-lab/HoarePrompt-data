You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

    #State: The printed values of `num` for each iteration of the outer loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of constraints. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of integers that satisfy all the given constraints. Constraints are categorized into three types: those that specify upper bounds, those that specify lower bounds, and those that specify exact values. The function ensures that the calculated number is non-negative, printing 0 if no integers satisfy the constraints.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in handling the constraints. Specifically, the calculation of the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints is incorrect. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Range Calculation**:
   ```python
   num = min(less) - max(big) + 1
   ```
   This line calculates the number of integers in the range `[max(big), min(less)]`. However, it does not account for the possibility that `max(big)` could be greater than `min(less)`, which would result in a negative number of integers, but the program does not handle this case correctly. The program simply sets `num` to 0 if `num < 1`, but this is not the only issue.

2. **Handling Non-Equality Constraints**:
   ```python
   for i in no:
       if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
           num -= 1
   ```
   This part of the code correctly reduces the count of valid integers `k` if they fall within the range `[max(big), min(less)]` and are also in the `no` list. However, the issue arises from the incorrect initial calculation of `num`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `max(big) > min(less)`, the program should immediately output `0` because there are no integers `k` that can satisfy both `k >= max(big)` and `k <= min(less)`.
   - If `max(big) == min(less)`, the program should check if this single integer is in the `no` list. If it is, the output should be `0`; otherwise, it should be `1`.

To fix the program, the range calculation should be handled more robustly. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        big = []
        no = []
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            (x, a) = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        min_less = min(less)
        max_big = max(big)
        
        if max_big > min_less:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        num = min_less - max_big + 1
        for i in no:
            if i <= min_less and i >= max_big:
                num -= 1
        
        print(num)

```

This corrected version ensures that if `max(big) > min(less)`, it immediately outputs `0`, which is the correct behavior according to the problem description.
