Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down why:

1. **Function Logic**: The function `func_1(a, b)` is supposed to determine the number of winners when there are `b` players initially and the sequence `a` is used to kick players out. However, the current function simply returns `a - 1` if `a <= b` and `b` otherwise, which does not follow the rules of the game.

2. **Game Simulation**: The game involves multiple rounds where players are kicked out based on the sequence `a`. The program does not simulate these rounds. Instead, it makes a single call to `func_1` for each query, which is insufficient to determine the number of winners.

3. **Looping and Simulation**: The program should simulate the game for each value of `n_i` by repeatedly removing players based on the sequence `a` until no players are removed in a round. It should then count the remaining players as winners.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def simulate_game(a, n):
    players = list(range(1, n + 1))
    while True:
        removed = set()
        for pos in a:
            if pos - 1 < len(players):
                removed.add(players[pos - 1])
        if not removed:
            break
        players = [player for player in players if player not in removed]
    return len(players)

n = int(input())
for _ in range(n):
    k, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
    results = [simulate_game(a, n_i) for n_i in queries]
    print(' '.join(map(str, results)))
```

This corrected version properly simulates the game for each query and outputs the correct number of winners.
