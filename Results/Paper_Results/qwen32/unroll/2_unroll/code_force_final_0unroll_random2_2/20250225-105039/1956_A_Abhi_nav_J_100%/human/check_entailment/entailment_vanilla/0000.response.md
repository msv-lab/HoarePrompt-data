### Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` is supposed to determine the number of winners for a given number of players `b` and a sequence `a`.
   - However, the current implementation of `func_1` only considers the first element of the sequence `a` and returns `a - 1` if `a` is less than or equal to `b`, otherwise it returns `b`. This is incorrect because the game's rules involve removing players at positions specified by the entire sequence `a` in each round until no more players can be removed.

2. **Looping Through `k_wali_list`:**
   - The program only uses `int(k_wali_list[0])` in the `func_1` call, meaning it only considers the first position in the sequence `a` for all calculations. This is incorrect as the problem requires considering all positions in the sequence `a`.

3. **Game Simulation Logic:**
   - The game involves simulating rounds where players at specified positions are removed. The program does not simulate these rounds and instead applies a simplified and incorrect formula to determine the number of winners.

### Correct Implementation Steps:
1. **Initialize Players:** Start with a list of players.
2. **Simulate Rounds:** In each round, remove players at the positions specified by the sequence `a` that still exist in the list.
3. **Check for Removals:** If no players are removed in a round, the game ends.
4. **Count Winners:** The remaining players are the winners.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the provided program, it is clear that it does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: False**
