### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in the functions `func_1` and `func_2` aligns with the problem description and the expected outcomes.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Tree Structure**: The input describes a tree with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges. We need to determine the winner of a game played on this tree.
2. **Game Rules**: Ron and Hermione take turns moving a stone from the current node to an adjacent inactive node. The player who cannot make a move loses.
3. **Objective**: Determine the winner for each round given the starting node of the stone.

#### Analysis of Functions:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - **Purpose**: This function determines whether a given starting node leads to a win for Ron (the first player) if both players play optimally.
  - **Logic**:
    - If the current node is a leaf (i.e., it has only one neighbor, which is the parent), it returns `False` because the player whose turn it is will lose (since there are no valid moves).
    - Otherwise, it recursively checks all neighbors (excluding the parent) and returns `True` if any neighbor leads to a win for the current player (i.e., if `not func_1(nodes, node, start)` is `True` for any neighbor).
    - The function essentially checks if the starting node can force a win for Ron by exploring all possible moves.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - **Purpose**: This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and determines the winner for the given starting node.
  - **Logic**:
    - It reads the number of nodes `n` and the number of rounds `t` (which is always 1).
    - It reads the edges of the tree and constructs the adjacency list `nodes`.
    - It identifies all leaf nodes and stores them in a deque `leaves`.
    - It reads the starting node for the game.
    - It calls `func_1` with the starting node and determines the winner based on the result.
    - If `func_1` returns `True`, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.

#### Verification:
- The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine if the starting node leads to a win for Ron. It uses a recursive approach to explore all possible moves and returns the correct result based on the game rules.
- The function `func_2` correctly reads the input, constructs the tree, and determines the winner using the result from `func_1`.

#### Example Verification:
- For the provided example:
  - Input:
    ```
    5 1
    1 2
    1 3
    3 4
    3 5
    1
    ```
  - The tree structure is:
    ```
    1
   / \
  2   3
     / \
    4   5
    ```
  - Starting node is `1`.
  - `func_1` will be called with `start=1` and will determine that Ron has a winning strategy.
  - The output will be `Ron`, which matches the expected result.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given starting node and the tree structure. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
