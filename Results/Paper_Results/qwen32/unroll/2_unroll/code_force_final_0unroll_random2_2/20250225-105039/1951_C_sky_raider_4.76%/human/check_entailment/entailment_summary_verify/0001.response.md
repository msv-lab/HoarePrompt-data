Let's analyze the given program and the function summary in detail to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets over `n` days with the given constraints:
- A person may purchase no more than `m` tickets per day.
- If a person purchases `x` tickets on day `i`, all subsequent days' ticket prices will increase by `x`.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Sorting the list of ticket prices.
2. Iteratively purchasing tickets starting from the lowest price.
3. Adjusting the number of tickets to purchase each day based on the remaining tickets needed (`k`) and the maximum allowed (`m`).
4. Calculating the cost by adjusting for the increasing prices.

However, there are several issues with the program:
1. The variable `c` is initialized to `k * k / 2`, which is not a meaningful starting point for the cost calculation.
2. The logic for calculating the cost is incorrect. The program subtracts `s * s / 2` from the cost, which doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.
3. The program does not correctly account for the increasing prices of subsequent days.
4. The loop continues for all `n` days, even if `k` tickets have been purchased.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly:
1. Sort the list of ticket prices.
2. Iterate through the sorted list, purchasing tickets each day up to the maximum allowed (`m`), and adjust the remaining tickets (`k`).
3. Calculate the cost by multiplying the number of tickets purchased on each day by the current price and add it to the total cost.
4. Increase the price for subsequent days by the number of tickets purchased on the current day.

### Detailed Analysis of the Code
Let's break down the code and identify the issues:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        s = 0
        c = k * k / 2  # This is incorrect initialization
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)  # Correctly determines the number of tickets to buy
            k -= s  # Correctly decreases the number of tickets needed
            c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2  # Incorrect cost calculation
        print(int(c))
```

- **Initialization of `c`**: The variable `c` is initialized to `k * k / 2`, which is not a valid starting point for the cost. The cost should start at 0.
- **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2` is incorrect. The term `s * s / 2` does not make sense in the context of the problem. The correct calculation should be `c += l[i] * s`.

### Corrected Program
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        total_cost = 0  # Correct initialization of cost
        increment = 0  # To keep track of the price increase
        for price in l:
            if k == 0:
                break  # Stop if no more tickets are needed
            tickets_to_buy = min(m, k)  # Determine the number of tickets to buy
            total_cost += (price + increment) * tickets_to_buy  # Calculate the cost
            k -= tickets_to_buy  # Decrease the number of tickets needed
            increment += tickets_to_buy  # Increase the price for subsequent days
        print(total_cost)
```

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified and the corrected approach, the provided program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
