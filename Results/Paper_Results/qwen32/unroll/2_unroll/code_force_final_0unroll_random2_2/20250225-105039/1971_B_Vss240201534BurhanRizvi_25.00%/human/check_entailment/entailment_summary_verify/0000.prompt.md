You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of a string `s` of lowercase English letters. For each string `s`, it checks if a shuffled version of `s` is different from `s` itself. If they differ, it prints "Yes" followed by the shuffled string; otherwise, it prints "No". The function does not return any value but outputs the results directly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program uses the `random.sample` function to shuffle the string `s` into `s2`. While this approach may work for some cases, it is not guaranteed to produce a different string `s2` from `s` for every input. Specifically, if the input string `s` consists of all identical characters (e.g., "aaaaa"), then any permutation of `s` will be the same as `s` itself. In such cases, the program will incorrectly report "NO" because `s` and `s2` will be the same.

For example, consider the input "aaaaa". The program might generate "aaaaa" again as `s2`, leading to an incorrect output of "NO" instead of "YES" with a different permutation. This violates the problem description, which requires that if a rearrangement exists, the program should output "YES" and the rearranged string.

Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
