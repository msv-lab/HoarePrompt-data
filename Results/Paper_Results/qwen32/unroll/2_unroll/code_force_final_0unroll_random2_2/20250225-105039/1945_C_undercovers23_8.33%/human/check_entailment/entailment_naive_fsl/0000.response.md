Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the program calculates percentages instead of the required counts of 0s and 1s on each side of the road. This can lead to incorrect results.

Here is a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Percentage Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `zero_perc` and `one_perc` as percentages:
     ```python
     zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))
     one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))
     ```
   - It then checks if these percentages are greater than or equal to 50. This is incorrect because the problem requires checking if the counts of 0s and 1s on each side are at least half of the total counts on that side, not percentages.

2. **Correct Condition**:
   - The correct condition should be:
     ```python
     if zero >= math.ceil((i + 1) / 2) and (o - one) >= math.ceil((n - i - 1) / 2):
         lst.append(i + 1)
     ```
   - Here, `zero` should be at least `math.ceil((i + 1) / 2)` and `(o - one)` should be at least `math.ceil((n - i - 1) / 2)`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the cases where the road can be placed before the first house (`i = 0`) or after the last house (`i = n`). These cases should be explicitly checked.
   - For example, if all residents want to live on one side, the road should be placed before the first house if all want to live on the right or after the last house if all want to live on the left.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        o = s.count('1')
        z = s.count('0')
        (zero, one) = (0, 0)
        lst = []
        mini = float('inf')
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero += 1
            else:
                one += 1
            if zero >= math.ceil((i + 1) / 2) and (o - one) >= math.ceil((n - i - 1) / 2):
                lst.append(i + 1)
        # Check for placing the road before the first house
        if z >= math.ceil(n / 2):
            lst.append(0)
        # Check for placing the road after the last house
        if o >= math.ceil(n / 2):
            lst.append(n)
        for ele in lst:
            mini = min(mini, abs(n // 2 - ele))
        final = []
        for elem in lst:
            if abs(n // 2 - elem) == mini:
                final.append(elem)
        final.sort()
        print(final[0])

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the conditions are checked correctly and handles the edge cases appropriately.
