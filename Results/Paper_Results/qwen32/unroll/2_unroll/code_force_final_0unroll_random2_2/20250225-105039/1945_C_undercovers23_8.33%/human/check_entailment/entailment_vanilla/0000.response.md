Let's analyze the provided Python program to see if it correctly solves the given problem according to the requirements.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of houses `n` and the string `s` representing the preferences of the villagers.

2. **Middle Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `pk` which is `n // 2`. This is used to determine the middle of the village.

3. **Counting Preferences**:
   - It counts the total number of '1's (`o`) and '0's (`z`) in the string `s`.

4. **Iterating Over Possible Positions**:
   - The program iterates over possible positions `i` (from 0 to `n-2`) to place the road.
   - It keeps track of the cumulative number of '0's (`zero`) and '1's (`one`) encountered up to position `i`.
   - It calculates the percentage of '0's and '1's on the left and right sides of the road, respectively, using `math.ceil` to round up the required number of satisfied residents.

5. **Checking Conditions**:
   - If the percentage of satisfied residents on both sides meets the condition (i.e., at least half of the residents on each side want to live on that side), it adds the position `i + 1` to the list `lst`.

6. **Finding the Optimal Position**:
   - It then finds the position in `lst` that is closest to the middle (`pk`).
   - If no such position exists, it considers placing the road either before the first house (position 0) or after the last house (position `n`), depending on the majority preference of the residents.

7. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the optimal position for each test case.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program calculates percentages instead of the actual counts of '0's and '1's needed to satisfy the condition.
- Specifically, the conditions `zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50` are incorrect. Instead, the program should check if the number of '0's on the left side is at least `math.ceil((i + 1) / 2)` and the number of '1's on the right side is at least `math.ceil((n - i - 1) / 2)`.
- The program calculates `zero_perc` and `one_perc` as percentages, which is unnecessary and incorrect for this problem.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. The conditions for checking the number of satisfied residents are not correctly implemented.

**Correctness: False**
