### Reasoning:

The given problem requires us to minimize the cost of purchasing `k` tickets over `n` days, considering the constraints that we can buy at most `m` tickets per day and that each purchase increases the price of subsequent tickets.

The program provided follows a greedy approach to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Parsing:** The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the values `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the list of ticket prices for each day.

2. **Sorting:** The list of prices `l` is sorted in ascending order. Sorting is a critical step because it allows the program to purchase tickets at the lowest available prices first, thereby minimizing the total cost.

3. **Initialization:** The variables `t` (total increase in price due to previous purchases), `s` (number of tickets to purchase on the current day), and `c` (total cost) are initialized to 0.

4. **Iterating Over Days:** The program iterates over each day (or the sorted list of prices):
   - `s` is set to the minimum of `m` (maximum tickets that can be bought per day) and `k` (remaining tickets to be bought).
   - The cost for the current day is added to `c`, which is calculated as `s * (l[i] + t)`. Here, `l[i]` is the price of the ticket on the current day (after sorting), and `t` is the cumulative increase in price due to previous purchases.
   - `t` is incremented by `s` to account for the increase in price for subsequent days.
   - `k` is decremented by `s` to reflect the remaining tickets that need to be purchased.

5. **Output:** After processing all days for a particular test case, the total cost `c` is printed.

### Analysis:

The greedy approach used in the program is correct for this problem. By always purchasing tickets at the lowest available prices first, the program ensures that the total cost is minimized. The constraints are handled efficiently, and the program scales well within the given limits (e.g., up to 300,000 days and up to 10^9 tickets per day).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
