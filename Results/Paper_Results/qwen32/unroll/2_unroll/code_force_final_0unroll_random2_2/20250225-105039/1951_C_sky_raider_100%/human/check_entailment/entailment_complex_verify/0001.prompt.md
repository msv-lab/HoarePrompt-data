You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), and a list of \( n \) integers representing the price per ticket for each of the \( n \) days. For each test case, it calculates and prints the total cost based on the given constraints and logic.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding
The task is to buy `k` tickets over `n` days at the minimum cost, given that:
- The price of tickets on day `i` is `a_i`.
- You can buy at most `m` tickets per day.
- Buying `x` tickets on day `i` increases the price of tickets on all subsequent days by `x`.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve this problem by:
1. Reading the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Reading `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - Reading the list of prices `a_i` and sorting it in ascending order.
   - Iterating through the sorted list and buying tickets in a greedy manner:
     - On each day, it buys the minimum of `m` tickets or the remaining tickets `k` needed.
     - It calculates the cost of these tickets considering the accumulated price increase `t`.
     - It updates the total cost `c` and the accumulated price increase `t`.
     - It reduces the number of tickets `k` by the number of tickets bought on that day.
3. Printing the total cost for each test case.

### Correctness Evaluation
The greedy approach of buying the cheapest available tickets first is intuitive but does not guarantee the optimal solution in this problem. The reason is that the price increase mechanism can make it more beneficial to buy tickets on more expensive days if it allows you to buy more tickets at once and thus reduce the overall cost.

### Counterexample
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 2 3
1 10 1
```
The correct strategy is to buy 2 tickets on the first day (cost = 2) and 1 ticket on the third day (cost = 3), resulting in a total cost of 5. However, the program would buy 1 ticket on the first day (cost = 1), 1 ticket on the second day (cost = 11), and 1 ticket on the third day (cost = 12), resulting in a total cost of 24, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem due to the suboptimal greedy strategy. The correct approach would likely involve dynamic programming or another more sophisticated method to account for the price increase mechanism.

### Final Answer
Reasoning: The provided program does not guarantee the minimum cost due to a suboptimal greedy strategy.
Correctness: **False**
