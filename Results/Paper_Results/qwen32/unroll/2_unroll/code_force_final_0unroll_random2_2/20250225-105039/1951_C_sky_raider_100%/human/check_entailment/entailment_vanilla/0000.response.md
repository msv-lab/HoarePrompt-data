Let's analyze the given program and the problem statement step by step to determine its correctness.

The problem requires us to find the minimum cost to purchase exactly `k` tickets, given the prices for `n` days and constraints on the number of tickets that can be bought per day and the price increase mechanism.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the list of prices `l` for each day.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list of prices `l` is sorted in ascending order. This is a key step because it allows us to buy tickets on the cheapest days first, which minimizes the cost.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `t` (total increase in price due to previous purchases) and `c` (total cost) to 0.
   - It iterates through each day, buying up to `min(m, k)` tickets each day.
   - For each batch of tickets bought on day `i`, it adds the cost to `c` and updates `t` (the total increase in price for subsequent days).
   - It also reduces `k` by the number of tickets bought.

4. **Output**:
   - The total cost `c` is printed for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis

- **Sorting**: Sorting the prices in ascending order ensures that we are always buying tickets on the cheapest available days first, which is optimal for minimizing the cost.
  
- **Buying Tickets**: The program correctly buys up to `min(m, k)` tickets each day, ensuring that we do not exceed the daily purchase limit `m` and that we buy exactly `k` tickets in total.

- **Price Increase**: The program correctly updates the price increase `t` after each purchase, which is essential to calculate the correct cost for subsequent days.

- **Edge Cases**: The program handles cases where `k` is less than `m` (buying fewer tickets than the daily limit) and cases where `k` is exactly `nm` (buying the maximum possible tickets).

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem. It efficiently calculates the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets by always buying on the cheapest available days and correctly accounting for the price increase mechanism.

**Correctness: True**
