To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the states of `bigList` and `smallList` as per the loop condition `len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `len(smallList) > 0`**
   - This condition requires that `smallList` should not be empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `smallList` contains at least one element.

2. **Condition 2: `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`**
   - This condition requires that the last element of `bigList` should be equal to the last element of `smallList`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the last element of `bigList` is the same as the last element of `smallList`.

Let's adjust the states accordingly:

- Ensure `smallList` has at least one element.
- Ensure the last element of `bigList` is equal to the last element of `smallList`.

Given that `bigList` contains all but one of the subarray sums of a palindrome array, and `smallList` contains a subset of these sums, we can assume that there exists at least one common element between `bigList` and `smallList` that can be used to satisfy the second condition.

### Example Adjustment:
- Let's assume the last element of `bigList` is `x`.
- We need to ensure that `smallList` contains `x` as its last element.

State: **`bigList` is a list of integers ending with `x`, and `smallList` is a list of integers ending with `x`**

Here, `x` is the last element of `bigList` and also the last element of `smallList`, ensuring both conditions are met.

### Final Answer:
State: **`bigList` is a list of integers ending with `x`, and `smallList` is a list of integers ending with `x`**

This ensures that `len(smallList) > 0` and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`, allowing the `while` loop to execute its first iteration.
