#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length m, where m is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets (1 ≤ k ≤ 26). n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) representing the length of the strings to be checked as subsequences. k and n are integers such that the strings are formed using only the first k lowercase English alphabets. The function is called for each test case, and the sum of m and n across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
        
    #State: `s1` is the same as `s`, `s2` contains the last `k-1` characters of `s`, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
    r = len(s1) // k
    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #The program returns a tuple containing three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, the substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and `s2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a string `s` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, returning a tuple with a boolean indicating if the length of `s` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s` starting from a calculated index, and a string `s2` which contains characters based on the removal logic within the function.
