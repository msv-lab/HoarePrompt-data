s is a string of length m, where m is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets (1 ≤ k ≤ 26). n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) representing the length of the strings to be checked as subsequences. k and n are integers such that the strings are formed using only the first k lowercase English alphabets. The function is called for each test case, and the sum of m and n across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
