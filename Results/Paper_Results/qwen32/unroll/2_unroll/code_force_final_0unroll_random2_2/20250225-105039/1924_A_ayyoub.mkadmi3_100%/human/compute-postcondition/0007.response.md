Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, an integer `k` representing the number of distinct alphabets used, and an integer `n` representing the length of the strings to be checked as subsequences. The function returns a tuple containing three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, the substring of `s` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and `s2`. However, based on the provided output description, it seems `s2` is not defined in the output details, so it might be a placeholder or an error in the description. Assuming `s2` is not part of the expected output, the function returns a boolean and the substring of `s`.**
