You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length m, where m is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets (1 ≤ k ≤ 26). n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) representing the length of the strings to be checked as subsequences. k and n are integers such that the strings are formed using only the first k lowercase English alphabets. The function is called for each test case, and the sum of m and n across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #The program returns a tuple containing three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, the substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and `s2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a string `s` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, returning a tuple with a boolean indicating if the length of `s` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s` starting from a calculated index, and a string `s2` which contains characters based on the removal logic within the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Let's analyze the code and find a specific case where it fails.

The function `func_1` is supposed to determine if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in the given string `s`. However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not correctly handle the problem requirements.

Here’s a specific case where the program fails:

### Test Case:
```
1
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```

### Expected Output:
```
NO
aaa
```

### Explanation of the Expected Output:
The string `s` is `aabbccabab`. We need to check if all possible strings of length 3 using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets (`a`, `b`, `c`) occur as subsequences in `s`. Some of these strings are `aaa`, `aab`, `aac`, `aba`, `abc`, etc. The string `aaa` does not occur as a subsequence in `s`, so the correct output should be `NO` followed by `aaa`.

### Actual Output of the Program:
The provided program will not output `aaa` as the missing subsequence. Instead, it will likely output a different string, such as `aab` or `aba`, because the logic in `func_1` does not correctly identify the missing subsequence.

### Why the Program is Incorrect:
The function `func_1` has several issues:
1. It does not correctly check all possible subsequences of length `n`.
2. The logic for constructing the missing subsequence is flawed.
3. It does not ensure that the missing subsequence is the first one that does not appear in `s`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and check if each of these strings is a subsequence in `s`. If we find a string that is not a subsequence, we output `NO` followed by that string.

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect for at least one potential case, so the correctness is **False**.
