### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem as described, but there are several issues with the logic and implementation of the function `func_1`. Here's a detailed breakdown of the problems:

1. **Logic for Checking Subsequences**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. However, the current logic does not achieve this. The function is only checking if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k` and is not correctly identifying the missing subsequences.

2. **Generating the Missing Subsequence**:
   - When the program determines that not all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`, it attempts to generate a missing subsequence. The current logic for generating this subsequence is flawed. It only checks for the first character that is missing in `s1` and repeats it to form a string of length `n - len(s2)`, which does not guarantee that the generated string is a missing subsequence.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is greater than `k` or when `n` is 1. It also does not correctly identify and generate all possible missing subsequences of length `n`.

### Correctness:

Given the issues mentioned above, the current implementation of the program is incorrect. The logic for checking subsequences and generating a missing subsequence needs to be revised.

**Correctness: False**

### Revised Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. Check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.
3. If any string is not a subsequence, print "NO" followed by that string.
4. If all strings are subsequences, print "YES".

Here is a sketch of how the revised program could look:

```python
def is_subsequence(s, sub):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(char in it for char in sub)

def generate_strings(k, n):
    if n == 0:
        return [""]
    smaller_strings = generate_strings(k, n - 1)
    return [char + s for char in string.ascii_lowercase[:k] for s in smaller_strings]

def solve(t):
    OUT = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        all_strings = generate_strings(k, n)
        missing = None
        for sub in all_strings:
            if not is_subsequence(s, sub):
                missing = sub
                break
        if missing:
            OUT.append('NO')
            OUT.append(missing)
        else:
            OUT.append('YES')
    for i in OUT:
        print(i)

t = int(input())
solve(t)
```

This revised approach ensures that all possible strings of length `n` are checked and correctly identifies any missing subsequence.
