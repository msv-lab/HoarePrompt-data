Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It interacts with an interactor to determine a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1 by asking up to 3n queries to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements. Based on these comparisons, it identifies a pair of indices (i, j) that maximizes the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices and prints "! i j".**
