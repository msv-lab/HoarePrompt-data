Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `R` is a lambda function that reads an integer from the input. There are multiple test cases, each containing an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a permutation p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1} of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. For each test case, you can ask up to 3n queries in the form "? a b c d" to compare the bitwise OR of pairs (p_a, p_b) and (p_c, p_d). The interactor will respond with "<", "=", or ">" based on the comparison. After finding a pair of indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized, you must print "! i j". The total number of queries across all test cases must not exceed 3 times the sum of all n values, which is at most 3 * 10^4. The function `I` is defined to read and process input as a list of integers.
Code of the loop:
for kp in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    g = 0
    v1 = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        v2 = i
        print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r = input('')
        if r == '<':
            v1 = v2
    prev = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r = input()
        if r == '>':
            prev = i
    print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
    sys.stdout.flush()


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
