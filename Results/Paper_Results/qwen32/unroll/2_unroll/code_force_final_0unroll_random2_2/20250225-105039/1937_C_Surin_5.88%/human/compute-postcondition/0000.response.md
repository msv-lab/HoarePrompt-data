The provided code snippet is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split string into an integer, returning the result as a list of integers. This function does not change any existing variables or states but rather prepares for future input processing.

Given the initial state which includes multiple test cases with specific conditions about the integer `n` and the permutation `p`, the code snippet provided does not directly affect these conditions. It only sets up a function `I` for future use in reading and processing input.

Thus, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of the defined function `I`.

Output State: **There are multiple test cases, each containing an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a permutation p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1} of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. For each test case, you can ask up to 3n queries in the form "? a b c d" to compare the bitwise OR of pairs (p_a, p_b) and (p_c, p_d). The interactor will respond with "<", "=", or ">" based on the comparison. After finding a pair of indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized, you must print "! i j". The total number of queries across all test cases must not exceed 3 times the sum of all n values, which is at most 3 * 10^4. The function `I` is defined to read and process input as a list of integers.**
