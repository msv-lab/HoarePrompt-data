You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are multiple test cases, each containing an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a permutation p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1} of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. For each test case, you can ask up to 3n queries in the form "? a b c d" to compare the bitwise OR of pairs (p_a, p_b) and (p_c, p_d). The interactor will respond with "<", "=", or ">" based on the comparison. After finding a pair of indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized, you must print "! i j". The total number of queries across all test cases must not exceed 3 times the sum of all n values, which is at most 3 * 10^4.
def func():
    I = lambda : list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    R = lambda : int(input())
    for kp in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        g = 0
        
        v1 = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            v2 = i
            print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r = input('')
            if r == '<':
                v1 = v2
        
        prev = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r = input()
            if r == '>':
                prev = i
        
        print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
        
        sys.stdout.flush()
        
    #State: the indices `prev` and `v1` that maximize the XOR value for the current test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It interacts with an interactor to determine a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1 by asking up to 3n queries to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements. Based on these comparisons, it identifies a pair of indices (i, j) that maximizes the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices and prints "! i j".

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
