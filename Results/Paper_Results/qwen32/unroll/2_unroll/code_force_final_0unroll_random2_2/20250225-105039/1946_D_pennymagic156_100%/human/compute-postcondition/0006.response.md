Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of list `a`.**

Here, `ans` is the maximum count of elements in `a` whose `i`-th bit, when XORed, results in `0`, and `len(a)` is the number of elements in the list `a`. The return value is whichever of these two is greater.
