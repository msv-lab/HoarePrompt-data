The code snippet `a = func_1()` reassigns the variable `a` to the value returned by `func_1()`. The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n`. However, after executing the code, `a` is now assigned the return value of `func_1()`, which could be any list of non-negative integers, and it may or may not have the same length `n`.

The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer returned by `func_3()` representing the length of the array `a`, `x` is a non-negative integer returned by `func_3()` representing the favorite number, and `a` is a list of non-negative integers returned by `func_1()`.**
