Functionality: **The function `func_2` processes a string `s1` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, along with its length `n`, and calculates a list `ans` of values based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters in the string. The final output is the list `ans`, which is printed. The function does not modify the input string `s1` or the integer `n`.**
