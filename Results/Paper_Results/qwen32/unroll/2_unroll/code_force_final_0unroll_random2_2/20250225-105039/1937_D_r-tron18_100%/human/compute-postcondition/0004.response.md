The code snippet `ans = [0] * n` initializes a list named `ans` with `n` elements, all set to `0`. This does not affect the other variables `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, or `suffZero`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n` equals the length of `s1`, `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting with an initial value of `0`, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element `0`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.**
