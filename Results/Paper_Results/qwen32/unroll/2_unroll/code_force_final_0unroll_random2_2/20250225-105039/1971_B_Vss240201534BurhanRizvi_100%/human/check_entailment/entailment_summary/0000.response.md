### Reasoning:
The provided program follows the problem description closely and handles the edge cases appropriately. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Single Character Strings**:
    - If the string `s` has a length of 1, it is impossible to rearrange it to form a different string. The program correctly outputs "NO" in this case.

2. **Strings with All Identical Characters**:
    - If the string `s` consists of the same character repeated (like "aaaaa"), any rearrangement will result in the same string. The program correctly identifies this condition by checking if the length of the set of characters (`len(set(s))`) is 1 and outputs "NO".

3. **General Case**:
    - For strings that are not of length 1 and do not consist of all identical characters, the program attempts to rearrange the string.
    - It uses `random.sample(s, len(s))` to shuffle the characters of the string. If the shuffled string `s2` is the same as the original string `s`, it performs a simple rotation by moving the first character to the end (`s[1:] + s[0]`).
    - The program then outputs "YES" followed by the modified string `s2`.

The program ensures that for all valid test cases, it either outputs "NO" when no rearrangement is possible or outputs "YES" followed by a valid rearrangement of the string.

### Correctness:
Based on the above reasoning, the program correctly handles all specified scenarios and edge cases as per the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
