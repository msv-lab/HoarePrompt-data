The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), the length of the array a. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), the elements of the array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
