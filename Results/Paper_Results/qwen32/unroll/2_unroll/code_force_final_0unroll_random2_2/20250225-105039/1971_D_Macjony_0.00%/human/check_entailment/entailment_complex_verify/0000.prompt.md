You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a single binary string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'.

    #State: The printed count values for each of the `t` test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` binary strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1', and prints the count of segments of consecutive identical characters minus one if there is at least one transition from '0' to '1'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Task**: Determine the minimum number of contiguous pieces a binary string must be cut into so that the pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).
- **Input**:
  - An integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, a binary string `s`.
- **Output**:
  - For each test case, print the minimum number of pieces needed.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads a binary string `s`. It then counts the number of transitions from '0' to '1' and uses this count to determine the minimum number of pieces required.

### Key Logic in the Program:
1. Initialize `count` to 1 (since at least one piece is needed).
2. Use a flag `flag` to check if there is at least one transition from '0' to '1'.
3. Iterate through the string and count transitions from '0' to '1'. Each transition indicates a need for an additional piece.
4. If there is at least one '0' to '1' transition, decrement the count by 1 (since the last piece can be combined with the previous piece if it ends in '0' and starts in '1').

### Potential Issues:
- The logic of decrementing `count` by 1 when there is a '0' to '1' transition seems incorrect. The number of pieces should be equal to the number of transitions plus one, as each transition marks a new piece.
- The flag `flag` is unnecessary and does not affect the final result correctly.

### Correctness Check:
Let's check the provided examples with the code to see if it works as expected:

1. **Input**: `11010`
   - Transitions: `1->0`, `0->1`, `1->0`
   - Count: 3 (initial) + 3 (transitions) - 1 (flag) = 5 - 1 = 4 (incorrect, should be 3)
2. **Input**: `00000000`
   - Transitions: None
   - Count: 1 (correct)
3. **Input**: `1`
   - Transitions: None
   - Count: 1 (correct)
4. **Input**: `10`
   - Transitions: `1->0`
   - Count: 2 (correct)
5. **Input**: `0001111`
   - Transitions: None
   - Count: 1 (correct)
6. **Input**: `0110`
   - Transitions: `0->1`, `1->0`
   - Count: 3 (initial) + 2 (transitions) - 1 (flag) = 4 - 1 = 3 (incorrect, should be 2)

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, it incorrectly decrements the count by 1 when there is a '0' to '1' transition, which leads to incorrect results in some scenarios.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program incorrectly handles the count of pieces by decrementing it when a '0' to '1' transition is found. This logic does not align with the correct approach of counting the number of transitions plus one. For example, the input `11010` should result in 3 pieces, but the program incorrectly calculates 4 pieces.
