The code provided reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The initial state includes `t` as an integer between 1 and 500, and each of the following `t` lines contains a single binary string `s` consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The code snippet provided only reads the value of `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. The binary strings `s` have not been read yet.**
