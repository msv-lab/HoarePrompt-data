### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to find the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations. Each operation allows you to select a contiguous subarray, compute its sum, and insert this sum anywhere in the array. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after these operations.

#### Key Points of the Program:
1. **Sum of the Array (`s`)**: The program calculates the sum of the array `a`. This is the base sum before any operations.
2. **Maximum Subarray Sum (`t`)**: The program calculates the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray using a variant of Kadane's algorithm. This value (`t`) is the maximum sum that can be added to the array in each operation.
3. **Operations (`k`)**: The program performs `k` operations. In each operation, the maximum subarray sum (`t`) is doubled and added to the current sum of the array. This is because the maximum subarray sum can be added multiple times, and each time it can be doubled by adding the sum of the subarray that includes the previously added sum.

#### Steps in the Program:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n`, the number of operations `k`, and the array `a`.
2. **Sum Calculation**: It calculates the sum of the array `a` and stores it in `s`.
3. **Maximum Subarray Sum Calculation**: It calculates the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray using Kadane's algorithm and stores it in `t`.
4. **Operation Execution**: It performs `k` operations. In each operation, it doubles the maximum subarray sum `t` and adds it to the current sum `ans`.
5. **Modulo Operation**: All calculations are done modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to prevent overflow and meet the problem's requirements.

#### Correctness:
- The approach of using Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum is correct.
- Doubling the maximum subarray sum in each operation is a valid strategy to maximize the sum of the array.
- The use of modulo \(10^9 + 7\) ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.
- The program handles multiple test cases efficiently within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It efficiently calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations and handles the constraints appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
