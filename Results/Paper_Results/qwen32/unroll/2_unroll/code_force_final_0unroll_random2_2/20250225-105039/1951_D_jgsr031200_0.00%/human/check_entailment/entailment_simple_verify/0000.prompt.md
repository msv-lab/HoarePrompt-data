You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Let's analyze the code and identify issues:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic**: 
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine if it's possible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels with `n` coins.
   - The initial check `if n == k` is correct: if Alice has the same number of coins as the number of jewels she wants, she can buy one jewel for 1 coin.
   - The check `if n < k` is also correct: if Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels she wants, she cannot buy all the jewels.
   - However, the logic after these checks is incorrect.

2. **Costs Calculation**:
   - The costs list is initialized with `[n - k + 1, 1]`, which is not a valid strategy for setting up stalls.
   - The loop iterates over the costs list, but the logic inside the loop doesn't correctly determine the number of stalls or their prices.
   - The logic for calculating the number of stalls and their prices is flawed, and it doesn't ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints "YES" and the number of stalls and their prices only if the sum of the calculated number of jewels (`h`) is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - However, the program does not ensure that the number of stalls is at most 60, and it does not correctly calculate the prices of the stalls.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Consider the test case `n = 1000000000000000000` (10^18) and `k = 1000000000000000000` (10^18). The program should print "YES", "1", "1" because Alice can buy one jewel for 1 coin.
   - Consider the test case `n = 1000000000000000000` (10^18) and `k = 1`. The program should print "YES", "60", "1 1 1 ... 1" (60 ones) because Alice can buy one jewel from each of the 60 stalls for 1 coin each.
   - The program does not handle these cases correctly.

Here is a counterexample where the program does not work as expected:

**Input**:
```
2
1000000000000000000 1000000000000000000
1000000000000000000 1
```

**Expected Output**:
```
YES
1
1
YES
60
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

**Actual Output**:
```
YES
1
1
NO
```

The program incorrectly prints "NO" for the second test case, which should be "YES" with 60 stalls each priced at 1 coin.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
