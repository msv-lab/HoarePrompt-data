Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. The function `func_1` is not correctly implemented to handle the problem requirements.
2. The logic for determining the prices for the stalls and ensuring Alice buys exactly `k` jewels is flawed.
3. The program only considers two stalls, which is not sufficient to handle all possible cases.
4. The program does not ensure that the total number of jewels bought by Alice equals `k`.
5. The program does not handle the case where `n < k` correctly, although it does print "NO" in that case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
        return
    
    # We can always use binary representation of k to determine the stalls
    # Each stall will have a price such that Alice buys exactly one jewel from it
    # The prices will be powers of 2, and we will select the appropriate ones
    stalls = []
    remaining_jewels = k
    i = 0
    
    while remaining_jewels > 0:
        if remaining_jewels & 1:  # If the least significant bit is 1
            stalls.append(2 ** i)
        remaining_jewels >>= 1  # Shift right to check the next bit
        i += 1
    
    if len(stalls) > 60:
        print('NO')
        return
    
    print('YES')
    print(len(stalls))
    print(*stalls)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(n, k)
```

This corrected version uses the binary representation of `k` to determine the prices for the stalls. Each stall corresponds to a power of 2, and Alice will buy one jewel from each stall that corresponds to a 1 in the binary representation of `k`. This ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The number of stalls is limited to 60, as required by the problem constraints.
