### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to determine if Bob can set up at most 60 stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels with `n` coins. However, the current implementation of the `func_1` function does not correctly solve the problem. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Initial Conditions Handling:**
   - If `n == k`, the program correctly prints "YES" and sets up a single stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel. This is correct.
   - If `n < k`, the program correctly prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy `k` jewels if she has fewer coins than jewels. This is also correct.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]` and then calculates `curr` as `n // i` for each cost `i` in `costs`. It then increments `h` by `curr` and subtracts `i * curr` from `n`.
   - This logic is flawed. The goal is to find a sequence of prices such that the total number of jewels Alice buys is exactly `k`. The current approach does not guarantee that `h` will be exactly `k` after the loop, and it doesn't ensure that the number of stalls does not exceed 60.

3. **Final Check:**
   - If `h < k`, the program prints "NO". This is correct, but the issue lies in ensuring that `h` is exactly `k` and that the number of stalls is within the limit.
   - If `h >= k`, the program prints "YES" and the prices in `costs`. However, `h` might not be exactly `k` due to the flawed logic, and `costs` might not contain the correct number of stalls.

### Correctness:

Given the issues in the logic and the potential for `h` not being exactly `k` and the number of stalls not being correctly managed, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**

The program needs to be revised to correctly determine the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels and the number of stalls does not exceed 60. One possible approach is to use a greedy algorithm or binary search to find the correct prices.
