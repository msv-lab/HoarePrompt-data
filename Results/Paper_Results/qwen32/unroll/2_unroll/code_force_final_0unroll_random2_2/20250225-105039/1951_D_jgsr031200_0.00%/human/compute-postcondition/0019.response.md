Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` is unchanged (we don't have an explicit value for `k`, but we know it's not less than itself).
   - `costs` is a list defined as `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - `h` is `k`, and `h` is not less than `k` (this condition is always true since `h` is defined as `k`).

2. **Determine the Values:**
   - `n` is explicitly given as 0.
   - `k` is not explicitly given, but we know it's a value such that `h = k` and `h` is not less than `k` (which is always true).
   - The `costs` list is defined as `[n - k + 1, 1]`. Substituting `n = 0`, we get `costs = [0 - k + 1, 1]` which simplifies to `costs = [1 - k, 1]`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(*costs)` statement will unpack the `costs` list and print its elements separated by spaces.
   - Given `costs = [1 - k, 1]`, the print statement will output `1 - k` followed by `1`.

Since we do not have an explicit value for `k`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `1 - k`. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

**Final Output:**
Output: **1 - k, 1 (where k is the unchanged value)**
