Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for each i; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'; The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5; `b` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the variable `b` is initialized as an empty list, while all other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
