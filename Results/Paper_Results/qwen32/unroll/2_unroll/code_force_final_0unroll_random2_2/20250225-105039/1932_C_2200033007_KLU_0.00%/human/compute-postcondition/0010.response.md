Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the length of list `a` and string `s`), `m` (an integer), `a` (a list of `n` integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'). The function returns the reversed version of the list `ans` where each element at index `i` is the product of all elements in `b` from index `i` to the end of `b` in the original order.**
