You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly follow the problem description. The issue lies in the way the product of the array elements is calculated and the order in which the results are output.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the problem and the code:

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Length of the array.
     - `m`: Modulus value.
     - `a`: List of `n` integers.
     - `s`: String of `n` commands ('L' or 'R').

2. **Processing Commands:**
   - For each command in the string `s`:
     - Output the remainder of the product of all elements in the current array `a` when divided by `m`.
     - If the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from `a`.
     - If the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from `a`.

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output `n` integers where each integer is the remainder of the product of the current array elements after processing each command.

### Code Analysis
The provided code attempts to solve the problem but has a few critical issues:
- It incorrectly collects elements to be removed from the array `a` based on the commands into a separate list `b`.
- It then calculates the product of the elements in `b` in reverse order and outputs these products, which is not what the problem requires.
- The product should be calculated on the current state of the array `a` after each command is processed, not on a list of removed elements.

### Counterexample
Consider the following input:
```
1
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 2 4 1
```

**Actual Output of the Provided Code:**
```
1 4 2 0
```

### Explanation of the Counterexample
1. **Initial Array:** `[3, 1, 4, 2]`
2. **First Command ('L')**:
   - Product: `3 * 1 * 4 * 2 % 6 = 0`
   - Remove leftmost element: `[1, 4, 2]`
3. **Second Command ('R')**:
   - Product: `1 * 4 * 2 % 6 = 2`
   - Remove rightmost element: `[1, 4]`
4. **Third Command ('R')**:
   - Product: `1 * 4 % 6 = 4`
   - Remove rightmost element: `[1]`
5. **Fourth Command ('L')**:
   - Product: `1 % 6 = 1`
   - Remove leftmost element: `[]`

The provided code, however, will not produce this output because it incorrectly accumulates elements in `b` and calculates the product in reverse order.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle the problem requirements and will not produce the correct output for various test cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
