### Reasoning:
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it always outputs 'B' when the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal. However, the problem description does not specify a preference for which character to output in the case of a tie. Therefore, the program's behavior (always outputting 'B' in case of a tie) is consistent and can be considered correct as long as it is defined and consistent.

The program correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string and then compares these counts to determine the most frequent character. If the counts are equal, the program will output 'B'. This behavior is explicitly defined in the code and is not arbitrary; it consistently handles ties by choosing 'B'.

Since the problem statement does not provide a tie-breaking rule and the program handles ties in a defined manner, the program can be considered correct.

### Final: **True**
