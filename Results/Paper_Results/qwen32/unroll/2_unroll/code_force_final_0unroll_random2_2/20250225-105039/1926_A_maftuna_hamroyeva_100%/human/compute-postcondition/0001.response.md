The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `i` is the loop counter and will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts, so we don't need to adjust it before the loop begins.

Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32, which already ensures that the loop will execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32, `i` is 0**
