Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the solution to the problem described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for `k` randomly chosen pairs of children, considering that the friendship values of chosen pairs increase by 1 for subsequent choices. The final expected value should be given as a fraction in the form of `p/q` modulo `10^9+7`.

### Key Points of the Problem

1. **Friendship Value Calculation**:
   - Initially, each friendship pair has a given friendship value `f_i`.
   - When a friendship pair is chosen, its friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent choices.

2. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The expected value is the sum of the expected friendship values for all `k` choices.
   - The expected value for each choice involves considering the probability of choosing each pair and the expected increase in friendship values due to previous choices.

3. **Output Requirements**:
   - The expected value should be expressed as a fraction `p/q` where `p` and `q` are coprime.
   - The result should be `p * q^(-1) % (10^9+7)`.

### Program Analysis

Let's look at the provided program and see if it correctly implements the above logic.

#### Program Breakdown

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads `m` lines of `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`.

2. **Calculating the Sum of Initial Friendship Values**:
   - The program calculates `sum_f`, the sum of all initial friendship values `f_i`.

3. **Calculating the Total Number of Possible Pairs**:
   - `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, which is the total number of possible pairs among `n` children.

4. **Calculating `p` and `q`**:
   - The program calculates `p` using the formula `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`.
   - It calculates `q` using the formula `2 * cn2 ** 2`.

5. **Simplifying the Fraction**:
   - The program simplifies the fraction `p/q` by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

6. **Calculating the Result**:
   - The program calculates the result as `p * q^(-1) % M` where `M = 10^9 + 7`.

#### Issues with the Program

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `p` and `q`**:
   - The formulas for `p` and `q` do not correctly represent the expected value calculation for the problem.
   - The expected value calculation involves more complex combinatorial and probabilistic considerations that are not captured by these formulas.

2. **Simplification and Result Calculation**:
   - While the simplification and modular arithmetic are correctly implemented, the incorrect values of `p` and `q` lead to incorrect results.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The formulas for `p` and `q` are incorrect, and thus the program does not compute the expected value as required.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
