The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, representing the number of individuals, the number of friendship pairs, and an integer `k`, respectively. For each test case, it also reads `m` sets of integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, where `a_i` and `b_i` are distinct individuals and `f_i` is a value associated with their friendship. The function computes and prints an integer result for each test case based on these inputs, ensuring the result is within the range of 0 to 1000000006.
