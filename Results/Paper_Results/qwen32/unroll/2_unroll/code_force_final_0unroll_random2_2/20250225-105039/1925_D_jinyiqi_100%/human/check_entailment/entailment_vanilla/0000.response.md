Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of children.
     - `m`: Number of pairs of friends.
     - `k`: Number of excursions.
     - `m` subsequent lines each containing `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` representing a friendship between children `a_i` and `b_i` with an initial friendship value `f_i`.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions, expressed as `p * q^-1 % (10^9 + 7)` where `p/q` is in simplest form.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It initializes `sum_f` to 0, which will store the sum of all initial friendship values.

2. **Reading Friendships:**
   - For each friendship, it reads `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` and adds `f_i` to `sum_f`.

3. **Calculating Combinations:**
   - `cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2` computes the total number of possible pairs of children.
   - `p` and `q` are calculated based on the formula given in the problem:
     - `p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`
     - `q = 2 * cn2 ** 2`
   - These formulas seem to be derived from the expected value calculation for the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions.

4. **Simplifying the Fraction:**
   - The program simplifies the fraction `p/q` by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

5. **Calculating the Result:**
   - It calculates `p * q^-1 % (10^9 + 7)` using modular exponentiation to find the modular inverse of `q` modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   - The result is printed for each test case.

### Correctness:
The program's logic seems to be based on the correct mathematical model for the problem. It calculates the expected sum of friendship values over `k` excursions by considering all possible pairs and their initial friendship values. The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

However, there is a discrepancy in the formula used for `p` and `q`. The provided formulas do not align with the expected value calculation as described in the problem statement. The correct approach involves calculating the expected value more carefully, taking into account the probability of selecting each pair and the changes in friendship values over time.

Given the discrepancy in the formula, the program is likely incorrect. The formula used in the program does not correctly reflect the expected value calculation as per the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
