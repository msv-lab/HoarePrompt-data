Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the expected value of the sum of the friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. However, there are several issues with the approach taken in the code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:** The expected value calculation in the program does not correctly account for the increase in friendship values over multiple excursions. The formula used in the code does not accurately reflect the expected sum of friendship values as described in the problem.

2. **Over-simplification of Probability:** The code uses a simplified approach to calculate the probability of selecting a pair of friends, but it fails to consider the dynamic nature of friendship values increasing as the same pair is selected multiple times.

3. **Incorrect Formula Implementation:** The formula implemented in the code does not match the problem's requirements. Specifically, the calculation of `p` and `q` does not correctly represent the expected value of the sum of friendship values.

4. **Handling of Large Numbers:** While the code attempts to handle large numbers using modular arithmetic, the incorrect formula means that the results are not accurate.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
