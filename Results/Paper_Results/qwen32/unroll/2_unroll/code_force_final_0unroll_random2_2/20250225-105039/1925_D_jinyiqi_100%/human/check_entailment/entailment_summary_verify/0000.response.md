To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to carefully analyze the formula used to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. Let's break down the problem and the implementation step by step.

### Problem Recap

1. **Input**:
   - Multiple test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of children.
     - `m`: Number of pairs of friends.
     - `k`: Number of excursions.
     - `m` lines of triples `(a_i, b_i, f_i)` representing friendships and their initial friendship values.

2. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions, expressed as `p * q^-1 % (10^9 + 7)`.

3. **Expected Calculation**:
   - The probability of selecting a specific pair of friends in one excursion is `1 / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`.
   - The expected sum of friendship values for all excursions can be derived using combinatorial probability and modular arithmetic.

### Formula Analysis

The provided program uses the following formula:
- `p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`
- `q = 2 * cn2 ** 2`

Where:
- `cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2` is the total number of possible pairs of children.
- `sum_f` is the sum of initial friendship values of all friend pairs.
- `m` is the number of friend pairs.
- `k` is the number of excursions.

Let's verify the correctness of this formula.

#### Expected Value Calculation

For each friend pair `(a_i, b_i)` with initial friendship value `f_i`:
- The probability of selecting this pair in one excursion is `1 / cn2`.
- The expected number of times this pair is selected in `k` excursions is `k / cn2`.
- The expected contribution of this pair to the sum of friendship values is the sum of an arithmetic series: `f_i + (f_i + 1) + ... + (f_i + k - 1)`, which is `k * f_i + (k * (k - 1)) / 2`.

Summing over all `m` friend pairs:
- The total expected contribution from all friend pairs is `sum_f * k + m * (k * (k - 1)) / 2`.

The denominator `q` is the total number of ways to choose `k` pairs out of all possible pairs, squared, which simplifies to `2 * cn2 ** 2`.

Thus, the formula should be:
- `p = sum_f * k + m * (k * (k - 1)) / 2`
- `q = cn2 ** 2`

However, the provided formula in the code is:
- `p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`
- `q = 2 * cn2 ** 2`

This formula does not match the expected derived formula. The factor of `2` in the numerator and denominator seems incorrect.

### Testing the Program

Let's recheck the provided examples and some edge cases.

#### Example 1

**Input**:
```
1
100 0 24
```

**Output**:
```
0
```

The program correctly outputs `0` since there are no friends.

#### Example 2

**Input**:
```
1
2 1 10
1 2 1
```

**Output**:
```
55
```

The program correctly calculates the sum of the first 10 natural numbers, which is `55`.

#### Example 3

**Input**:
```
1
5 2 4
1 2 25
3 2 24
```

**Output**:
```
777777784
```

The program correctly calculates the expected value and outputs `777777784`.

### Conclusion

While the program gives correct outputs for the provided examples, the formula used in the code does not match the expected derived formula. The presence of the factor of `2` in the numerator and denominator suggests an error in the formula.

### Final Evaluation

Based on the analysis, the formula used in the code is incorrect. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to be correct for all possible inputs.

Final: **False**
