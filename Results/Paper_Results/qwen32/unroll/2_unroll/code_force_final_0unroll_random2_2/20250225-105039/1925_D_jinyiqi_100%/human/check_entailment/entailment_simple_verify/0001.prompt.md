You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of children.
     - `m`: Number of pairs of friends.
     - `k`: Number of excursions.
     - `m` subsequent lines each containing `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` representing a friendship between children `a_i` and `b_i` with an initial friendship value `f_i`.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions, expressed as `p * q^-1 % (10^9 + 7)` where `p/q` is in simplest form.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It initializes `sum_f` to 0, which will store the sum of all initial friendship values.

2. **Reading Friendships:**
   - For each friendship, it reads `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` and adds `f_i` to `sum_f`.

3. **Calculating Combinations:**
   - `cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2` computes the total number of possible pairs of children.
   - `p` and `q` are calculated based on the formula given in the problem:
     - `p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`
     - `q = 2 * cn2 ** 2`
   - These formulas seem to be derived from the expected value calculation for the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions.

4. **Simplifying the Fraction:**
   - The program simplifies the fraction `p/q` by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

5. **Calculating the Result:**
   - It calculates `p * q^-1 % (10^9 + 7)` using modular exponentiation to find the modular inverse of `q` modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   - The result is printed for each test case.

### Correctness:
The program's logic seems to be based on the correct mathematical model for the problem. It calculates the expected sum of friendship values over `k` excursions by considering all possible pairs and their initial friendship values. The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

However, there is a discrepancy in the formula used for `p` and `q`. The provided formulas do not align with the expected value calculation as described in the problem statement. The correct approach involves calculating the expected value more carefully, taking into account the probability of selecting each pair and the changes in friendship values over time.

Given the discrepancy in the formula, the program is likely incorrect. The formula used in the program does not correctly reflect the expected value calculation as per the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
