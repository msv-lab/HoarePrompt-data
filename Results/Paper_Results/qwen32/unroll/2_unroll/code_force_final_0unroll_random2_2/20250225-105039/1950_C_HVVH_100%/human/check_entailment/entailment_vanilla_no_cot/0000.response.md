Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in handling the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format. Specifically, it incorrectly sets the day to 'AM' when the hour is 0 and does not correctly handle the case when the hour is exactly 12.

Here are the issues:
1. When `h` is 0, it should be converted to 12 and marked as 'AM'.
2. When `h` is 12, it should be marked as 'PM'.
3. When `h` is greater than 12, it should be converted to `h - 12` and marked as 'PM'.
4. When `h` is between 1 and 11, it should remain unchanged and marked as 'AM'.

The corrected code should look like this:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')

func()
```

This corrected code properly handles all edge cases and correctly converts the time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
