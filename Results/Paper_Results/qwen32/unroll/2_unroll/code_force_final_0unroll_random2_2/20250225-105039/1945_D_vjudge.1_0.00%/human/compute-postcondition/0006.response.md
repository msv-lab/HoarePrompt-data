The code snippet `pref = 0` assigns the value `0` to the variable `pref`. No other variables are affected by this statement.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= n; `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers of length n, where each element in `lista_A` is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; `lista_B` is a list of integers of length n, where each element in `lista_B` is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive and has been reversed; `soma_b` is 0; `pref` is 0.**
