### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Breakdown:
- **Objective**: Minimize the number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in a queue.
- **Constraints**:
  - Kirill can bribe people to swap positions.
  - Swapping with person `j` costs `a_j` coins.
  - For each person `k` between `j` and `i`, an additional `b_k` coins are required.
- **Input**:
  - Number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, `n` (number of people excluding Kirill), `m` (maximum allowable final position of Kirill).
  - Two lists `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` and `b_1, b_2, ..., b_n` representing the costs for swapping and additional costs, respectively.
- **Output**:
  - Minimum number of coins for each test case.

#### Analysis of the Provided Solution:
1. **Reversing Lists**:
   - The program reverses both `lista_A` and `lista_B`. This means the last `m` elements in the original list now become the first `m` elements in the reversed list.
   - This is a strategic move to simplify the problem, as it allows the program to focus on the last `m` people (who could potentially be swapped with Kirill) and the rest of the queue.

2. **Calculating Costs**:
   - `soma_b` keeps track of the cumulative cost of `b_k` for people who were not swapped.
   - `pref` accumulates the cost of swapping with people who have a smaller `a_i` than `b_i` up to the point where `lista_A[i] >= lista_B[i]`.
   - The loop iterates through the first `n - k` elements (the first part of the queue after reversing) and updates `soma_b` and `pref` accordingly.

3. **Finding Minimum Cost**:
   - The second loop iterates through the last `k` elements (the last part of the queue after reversing).
   - For each of these elements, it calculates the total cost (`pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`) and keeps track of the minimum cost encountered.
   - `soma_b` is updated to include the current `b_i` in each iteration.

4. **Output**:
   - The minimum cost calculated is printed for each test case.

#### Correctness:
- The approach correctly handles the problem constraints and efficiently calculates the minimum cost using a two-pass strategy.
- Reversing the lists simplifies the problem by focusing on the last `m` people and the rest of the queue.
- The use of `soma_b` and `pref` ensures that the program keeps track of all necessary costs accurately.
- The solution handles all edge cases, including when `m = n` (Kirill can be at the end of the queue) and when `m = 1` (Kirill needs to be at the front).

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly addresses the problem requirements and efficiently computes the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend.

**Correctness: True**
