To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which includes the variable `i` and the range `n - k` to `n`.

Here's the given state before the loop starts:
- `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
- `lista_A` and `lista_B` remain unchanged.
- `soma_b` is the sum of the last consecutive elements of `lista_B` where `lista_A[i]` was not less than `lista_B[i]`.
- `pref` is the accumulated sum from the loop steps.
- `resultado` is `float('inf')`.

The loop head is:
```
for i in range(n - k, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, the range `(n - k, n)` must be valid, meaning `n - k` must be less than `n`. This condition is inherently satisfied as long as `k` is a non-negative integer and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.

However, we need to ensure that the loop can start with the correct initial value of `i`. The initial value of `i` in the range `range(n - k, n)` is `n - k`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than `k` to ensure that the range is non-empty.

The states `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, `lista_B`, `soma_b`, `pref`, and `resultado` do not need adjustment for the loop to execute, as they are not part of the loop head. The only variable in the loop head that we can adjust is `i`, but since `i` is automatically initialized to `n - k` at the start of the loop, we don't need to adjust it manually.

Thus, the only requirement is that `n` must be greater than `k` for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be greater than `k`**
