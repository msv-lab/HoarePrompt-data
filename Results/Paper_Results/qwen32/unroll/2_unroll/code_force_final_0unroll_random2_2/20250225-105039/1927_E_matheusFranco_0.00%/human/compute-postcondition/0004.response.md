The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `curr_v`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `permutation`, `idx`, and `idx_v`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n, and k is even; `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is 1.**
