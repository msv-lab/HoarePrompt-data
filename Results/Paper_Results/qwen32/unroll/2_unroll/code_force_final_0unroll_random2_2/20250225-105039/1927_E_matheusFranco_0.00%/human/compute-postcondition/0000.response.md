The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an input value from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, the execution of the code will change the value of `t` to whatever positive integer value is provided by the user input.

Output State: **`t` is the positive integer input by the user**.
