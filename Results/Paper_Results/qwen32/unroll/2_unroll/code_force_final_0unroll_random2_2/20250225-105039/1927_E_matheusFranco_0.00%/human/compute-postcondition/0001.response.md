To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to make sure that the condition `t > 0` is satisfied. Given that `t` is the positive integer input by the user, we need to verify if `t` is indeed positive.

Since `t` is described as a "positive integer input by the user," it should already satisfy the condition `t > 0`. However, to adhere to the task requirements and ensure clarity, we can state that `t` must be greater than 0 right before the loop.

State: **`t` is the positive integer input by the user and `t` must be greater than 0**
