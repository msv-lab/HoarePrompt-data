The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `idx`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `permutation` are not modified by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n, and k is even; `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros; `idx` is 0.**
