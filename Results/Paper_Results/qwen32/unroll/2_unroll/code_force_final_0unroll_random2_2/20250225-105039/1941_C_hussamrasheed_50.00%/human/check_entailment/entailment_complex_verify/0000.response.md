### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why the provided code does not correctly determine the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

#### Code Analysis:

1. **Counting Substrings**:
   - The code counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" in the string.
   - It then removes all occurrences of "map" and counts "pie" again in the modified string.
   - Finally, it sums the counts of "map" and "pie" and prints the result.

2. **Issues with the Approach**:
   - **Overlapping Substrings**: The code does not handle overlapping substrings correctly. For example, in the string "ppiepie", the code counts two occurrences of "pie" and outputs 2. However, removing the second 'p' and the second 'i' would make the string "pepie", which is beautiful, and only requires 2 deletions. The code does not consider this optimal removal.
   - **Suboptimal Removal**: The code does not consider the optimal way to remove characters. For instance, in the string "mapmap", the code counts two occurrences of "map" and outputs 2. However, removing all characters would make the string empty, which is trivially beautiful, and requires 6 deletions. The code does not consider this optimal removal.

#### Counterexamples:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   ```
   1
   7
   ppiepie
   ```
   - Correct output: 2 (remove the second 'p' and the second 'i').
   - Provided code output: 2 (counts two "pie" occurrences).

2. **Test Case 2**:
   ```
   1
   6
   mapmap
   ```
   - Correct output: 6 (remove all characters).
   - Provided code output: 2 (counts two "map" occurrences).

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly determine the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. It only counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" and sums them up, without considering overlapping substrings or the optimal way to remove characters.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
