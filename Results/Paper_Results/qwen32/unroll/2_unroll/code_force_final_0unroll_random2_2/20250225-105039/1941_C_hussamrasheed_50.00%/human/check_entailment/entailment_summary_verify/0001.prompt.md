You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        m = s.count('map')
        s = s.replace('map', '')
        p = s.count('pie')
        print(m + p)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a string. It counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in each string, removes all occurrences of 'map', and then counts 'pie' again in the modified string. For each test case, it outputs the sum of these counts.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap
- We need to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string `s` to make it beautiful.
- A string is considered ugly if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map".
- The program should output the minimum number of characters to remove for each test case.

### Program Analysis
The given program does the following:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.
3. It counts the occurrences of the substring "map" in `s` and stores this count in `m`.
4. It removes all occurrences of "map" from the string `s`.
5. It counts the occurrences of the substring "pie" in the modified string `s` and stores this count in `p`.
6. It prints the sum of `m` and `p` as the result for each test case.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Assumption**: The program assumes that simply counting and removing "map" and then counting "pie" in the remaining string will give the correct answer. However, this is not always true because removing "map" might also affect the count of "pie" in the remaining string.
2. **Overcounting**: The program does not account for the fact that removing characters to eliminate one occurrence of "map" might also eliminate an occurrence of "pie" or vice versa. For example, in the string "mapie", removing "map" leaves "ie", which does not contain "pie".

### Correct Approach
A correct approach would involve using dynamic programming or another method to find the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of both "map" and "pie" without overcounting or incorrectly assuming the effects of deletions.

### Conclusion
Given the issues mentioned, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.
