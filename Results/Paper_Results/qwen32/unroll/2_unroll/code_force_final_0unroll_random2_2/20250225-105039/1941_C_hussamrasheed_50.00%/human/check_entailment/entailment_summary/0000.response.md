Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The task is to determine the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful by ensuring that neither "pie" nor "map" is a substring of the final string. However, the provided code only counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" and outputs their sum, which does not necessarily correspond to the minimum number of deletions required. The code does not consider the optimal way to remove characters to avoid both substrings simultaneously.

For example, in the first test case, the string "mmapnapie" contains "map" twice and "pie" once, but removing just two characters (the two 'm's in "mmap") would make the string beautiful, not three (two 'm's and one 'p') as suggested by the code.

Correctness: **False**
