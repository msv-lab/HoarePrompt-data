Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap
- We need to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string `s` to make it beautiful.
- A string is considered ugly if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map".
- The program should output the minimum number of characters to remove for each test case.

### Program Analysis
The given program does the following:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.
3. It counts the occurrences of the substring "map" in `s` and stores this count in `m`.
4. It removes all occurrences of "map" from the string `s`.
5. It counts the occurrences of the substring "pie" in the modified string `s` and stores this count in `p`.
6. It prints the sum of `m` and `p` as the result for each test case.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Assumption**: The program assumes that simply counting and removing "map" and then counting "pie" in the remaining string will give the correct answer. However, this is not always true because removing "map" might also affect the count of "pie" in the remaining string.
2. **Overcounting**: The program does not account for the fact that removing characters to eliminate one occurrence of "map" might also eliminate an occurrence of "pie" or vice versa. For example, in the string "mapie", removing "map" leaves "ie", which does not contain "pie".

### Correct Approach
A correct approach would involve using dynamic programming or another method to find the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of both "map" and "pie" without overcounting or incorrectly assuming the effects of deletions.

### Conclusion
Given the issues mentioned, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
