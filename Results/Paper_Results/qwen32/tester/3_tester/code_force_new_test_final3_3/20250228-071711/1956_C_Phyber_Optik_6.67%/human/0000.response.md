Sure, let's create comprehensive test cases for the given problem. We'll include both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the solution is robust, reliable, and scalable.

### Basic Test Cases

**Test 1**
- **Input**: 
  ```
  1
  1
  ```
- **Output**: 
  ```
  1 1
  1 1 1
  ```
- **Explanation**: The smallest possible matrix, with only one element. The maximum sum is 1, achieved by setting the single element to 1 using one type 1 operation.

**Test 2**
- **Input**: 
  ```
  1
  2
  ```
- **Output**: 
  ```
  7 3
  1 1 1 2
  1 2 1 2
  2 1 1 2
  ```
- **Explanation**: A 2x2 matrix. The maximum sum is 7, achieved by setting the first row to [1, 2], the second row to [1, 2], and then setting the first column to [1, 2]. This results in the matrix [[1, 2], [2, 2]].

### Edge Test Cases

**Test 3**
- **Input**: 
  ```
  1
  500
  ```
- **Output**: 
  ```
  125250 1000
  1 1 1 2 3 ... 500
  1 2 1 2 3 ... 500
  ...
  1 500 1 2 3 ... 500
  2 1 1 2 3 ... 500
  2 2 1 2 3 ... 500
  ...
  2 500 1 2 3 ... 500
  ```
- **Explanation**: The largest possible matrix. The maximum sum is calculated by filling each row and column with the permutation [1, 2, ..., 500], resulting in a sum of 125250. This requires 1000 operations (500 type 1 and 500 type 2).

**Test 4**
- **Input**: 
  ```
  2
  1
  2
  ```
- **Output**: 
  ```
  1 1
  1 1 1
  7 3
  1 1 1 2
  1 2 1 2
  2 1 1 2
  ```
- **Explanation**: Multiple test cases in a single input. The first test case is a 1x1 matrix, and the second is a 2x2 matrix. The outputs are as described in Test 1 and Test 2.

**Test 5**
- **Input**: 
  ```
  1
  3
  ```
- **Output**: 
  ```
  27 6
  1 1 1 2 3
  1 2 1 2 3
  1 3 1 2 3
  2 1 1 2 3
  2 2 1 2 3
  2 3 1 2 3
  ```
- **Explanation**: A 3x3 matrix. The maximum sum is 27, achieved by setting each row and column to the permutation [1, 2, 3]. This results in the matrix [[1, 2, 3], [2, 2, 3], [3, 3, 3]].

**Test 6**
- **Input**: 
  ```
  1
  4
  ```
- **Output**: 
  ```
  64 8
  1 1 1 2 3 4
  1 2 1 2 3 4
  1 3 1 2 3 4
  1 4 1 2 3 4
  2 1 1 2 3 4
  2 2 1 2 3 4
  2 3 1 2 3 4
  2 4 1 2 3 4
  ```
- **Explanation**: A 4x4 matrix. The maximum sum is 64, achieved by setting each row and column to the permutation [1, 2, 3, 4]. This results in the matrix [[1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 2, 3, 4], [3, 3, 3, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4]].

**Test 7**
- **Input**: 
  ```
  1
  2
  ```
- **Output**: 
  ```
  7 3
  1 1 1 2
  1 2 2 1
  2 1 1 2
  ```
- **Explanation**: A 2x2 matrix with a different permutation strategy. The maximum sum is still 7, achieved by setting the first row to [1, 2], the second row to [2, 1], and then setting the first column to [1, 2]. This results in the matrix [[1, 2], [2, 1]].

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including the smallest and largest possible matrices, multiple test cases in a single input, and different permutation strategies.
