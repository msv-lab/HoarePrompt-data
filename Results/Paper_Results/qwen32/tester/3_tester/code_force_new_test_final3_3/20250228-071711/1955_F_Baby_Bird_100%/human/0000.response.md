Sure, let's create a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem. We'll cover both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Bob wins if Eve removes no numbers, as the XOR of 1, 1, 1 is 1 (non-zero).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Bob wins if Eve removes one 1 and one 3, leaving 2 and 2, whose XOR is 0.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Eve can remove numbers in such a way that Bob wins 3 times. For example, removing one 1, one 2, and one 3 in each round.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Eve can remove numbers in such a way that Bob wins 3 times. For example, removing one 1, one 2, and one 3 in each round.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
0 9 9 9
```
**Output**: 
```
12
```
**Explanation**: Bob wins if Eve removes numbers optimally, leading to 12 wins for Bob.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There are no numbers, so no games are played, and Bob cannot win.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
200 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: All numbers are 1, and the XOR of 200 ones is 0, so Bob wins in the first round.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
0 200 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
**Explanation**: All numbers are 2, and the XOR of two 2s is 0, so Bob wins in every round of two numbers.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 200 0
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
**Explanation**: All numbers are 3, and the XOR of two 3s is 0, so Bob wins in every round of two numbers.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 0 200
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
**Explanation**: All numbers are 4, and the XOR of two 4s is 0, so Bob wins in every round of two numbers.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100 100 100 100
```
**Output**: 
```
300
```
**Explanation**: Eve can remove numbers in such a way that Bob wins 300 times, by removing pairs optimally.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: Eve can remove numbers in such a way that Bob wins 4 times.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: Eve can remove numbers in such a way that Bob wins 6 times.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Bob wins if Eve removes no numbers, as the XOR of 1 and 1 is 0.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Bob wins if Eve removes no numbers, as the XOR of 3 and 3 is 0.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Bob wins if Eve removes no numbers, as the XOR of 2 and 2 is 0.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There is only one number (4), and the XOR of 4 is 4 (non-zero), so Alice wins.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There is only one number (1), and the XOR of 1 is 1 (non-zero), so Alice wins.

# Test 19
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There is only one number (2), and the XOR of 2 is 2 (non-zero), so Alice wins.

# Test 20
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There is only one number (3), and the XOR of 3 is 3 (non-zero), so Alice wins.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic functionality and edge cases, ensuring the code is robust and handles all possible inputs correctly.
