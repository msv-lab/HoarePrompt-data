```
1
7 3 1
6 4 2
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: Bessie has chosen vertices 6, 4, and 2. You can choose 1 more vertex to maximize the number of triangles. The optimal choice would be vertex 5, resulting in 5 triangles.

1
4 2 2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Bessie has chosen vertices 1 and 3. You can choose 2 more vertices to maximize the number of triangles. The optimal choice would be vertices 2 and 4, resulting in 2 triangles.

10 5 0
1 3 5 7 9
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Bessie has chosen vertices 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. You cannot choose any more vertices. The optimal choice would be to form two triangles using vertices 1, 3, 5 and 5, 7, 9.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10 2 8
1 10
```
**Output**: 
```
8
```
**Explanation**: Bessie has chosen vertices 1 and 10. You can choose 8 more vertices to maximize the number of triangles. The optimal choice would be to choose all remaining vertices, resulting in 8 triangles.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 2 999999998
1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
999999998
```
**Explanation**: Bessie has chosen vertices 1 and 1000000000. You can choose 999999998 more vertices to maximize the number of triangles. The optimal choice would be to choose all remaining vertices, resulting in 999999998 triangles.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 0
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Bessie has chosen all vertices. You cannot choose any more vertices. Since all vertices are already chosen, it's impossible to form any additional triangles.

# Test 13
**Input**:

**Input**: 
```
1
10 4 6
1 2 8 9
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: Bessie has chosen vertices 1, 2, 8, and 9. You can choose 6 more vertices to maximize the number of triangles. The optimal choice would be vertices 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10, resulting in 6 triangles.
