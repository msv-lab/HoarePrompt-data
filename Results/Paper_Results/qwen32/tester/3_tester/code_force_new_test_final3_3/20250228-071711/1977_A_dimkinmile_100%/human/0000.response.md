Yes
```
**Explanation**: Maximum possible values for n and m where it's possible to build the tower by adding cubes.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
100 99
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: Maximum possible value for n and m-1 where it's possible to build the tower by adding 99 cubes and then removing 1.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1

```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: Maximum possible value for n and m=0 where it's possible to build the tower by adding and then removing all cubes.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
100 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
50 51
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Explanation**: n is less than m, so it's not possible to build the tower with more cubes than moves.

# Test 10

Yes
```
**Explanation**: n is greater than m, and it's possible to build the tower with 49 cubes by adding 49 cubes and then removing 1.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
50 50
```

```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: n equals m, and it's possible to build the tower with 50 cubes by adding 50 cubes.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: n is greater than m, and it's possible to build the tower with 1 cube by adding 1 cube and then removing 1.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: n is greater than m, and it's possible to build the tower with 0 cubes by adding 1 cube and then removing 1.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: n equals m, and it's possible to build the tower with 2 cubes by adding 2 cubes.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: n is greater than m, and it's possible to build the tower with 1 cube by adding 1 cube and then removing 1 twice.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
3 0
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: n is greater than m, and it's possible to build the tower with 0 cubes by adding 1 cube and then removing 1 three times.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Explanation**: n is greater than m, and it's possible to build the tower with 2 cubes by adding 2 cubes and then removing 1.

# Test 18
