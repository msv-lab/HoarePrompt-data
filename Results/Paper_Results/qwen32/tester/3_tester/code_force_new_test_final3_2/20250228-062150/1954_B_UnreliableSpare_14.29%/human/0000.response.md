Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: The array is already beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Removing any single element at index 2, 3, or 4 will make the array non-beautiful.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: An array with a single element is trivially beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Removing the first three elements (3, 3, 3) results in the array [5, 3, 3, 3], which is not beautiful.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: An array with two identical elements is beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 2 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Removing the element at index 2 (value 2) results in the array [1, 1, 1], which is not beautiful.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 2 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Removing the element at index 2 (value 2) results in the array [1, 2, 1, 1], which is not beautiful.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 2 3 2 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Removing elements at indices 2 and 4 (values 2 and 2) results in the array [1, 3, 1, 1], which is not beautiful.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 3 2 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: Removing elements at indices 2, 3, 4, and 6 (values 2, 3, 4, and 2) results in the array [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], which is not beautiful.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 ... (alternating 1s and 2s)
```
**Output**: 
```
50000
```
**Explanation**: Removing all elements of one type (either all 1s or all 2s) will make the array non-beautiful. Here, removing 50000 elements is the minimum.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... (all 1s)
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: An array with all identical elements is beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Removing the element at index 2 (value 3) results in the array [1, 1], which is not beautiful.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 3 1 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Removing the element at index 2 or 4 (value 3) results in the array [1, 1, 1, 1], which is not beautiful.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: Removing elements at indices 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 (values 2, 3, 4, 5, and 2) results in the array [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], which is not beautiful.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: Removing elements at indices 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (values 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) results in the array [1, 1], which is not beautiful.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases, and large input sizes, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the solution.
