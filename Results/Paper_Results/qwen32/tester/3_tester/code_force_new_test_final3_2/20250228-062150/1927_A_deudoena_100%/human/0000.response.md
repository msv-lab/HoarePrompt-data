# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
6
WWBBWB
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
9
WBWBWWWBW
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
**Explanation**: Painting cells from index 2 to 8 will make the entire strip white.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10
BBBBBBBBBB
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: All cells are black, so the entire strip needs to be painted.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
WWWWWWWWWW
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: All cells are already white. However, since the problem guarantees at least one black cell, this case is not valid per the problem statement. We'll skip this.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10
WBBBWWBBBW
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
**Explanation**: Painting cells from index 2 to 8 will make the entire strip white.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10
BBBWWBBBWB
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: Painting cells from index 1 to 9 will make the entire strip white.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10
WBBBWBWBWB
```
**Output**: 
```
8
```
**Explanation**: Painting cells from index 2 to 9 will make the entire strip white.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10
BBBWBBBWBB
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: Painting the entire strip will make it white.

```
1
10
WBBBBBBBBB
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
