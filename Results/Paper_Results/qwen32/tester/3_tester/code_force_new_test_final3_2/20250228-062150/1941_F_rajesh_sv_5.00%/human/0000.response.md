Sure, I'll provide a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem. These test cases will cover both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the robustness, reliability, and scalability of the solution.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 5
5 10 15 20 26
11 14 16 13 8
16 4 5 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: The current imbalance is 6 (between 20 and 26). Adding a problem with complexity 18 (13 + 5) reduces the imbalance to 5.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
7 6 5
1 4 7 10 18 21 22
2 3 5 7 4 2
6 8 9 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The current imbalance is 7 (between 10 and 18). Adding a problem with complexity 12 (4 + 8) reduces the imbalance to 4.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5 6 3
2 10 13 20 25
11 6 10 16 14 5
6 17 15
```
**Output**: 
```
8
```
**Explanation**: The current imbalance is 9 (between 13 and 20). No new problem can reduce this imbalance further.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2 2
11 12 14 15
19 14
10 6
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The current imbalance is 3 (between 11 and 12). Adding a problem with complexity 12 (14 + 6) reduces the imbalance to 2.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
1 10
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The current imbalance is 9. Adding a problem with complexity 2 (1 + 1) reduces the imbalance to 1.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1 1
1 1000000000 2000000000
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The current imbalance is 1000000000. Adding a problem with complexity 500000000 (1 + 1) reduces the imbalance to 1.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10 2 2
3 10 16 18 21 22 29 30 35 40
4 21
4 15 14 5
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
**Explanation**: The current imbalance is 9 (between 29 and 35). Adding a problem with complexity 23 (4 + 19) reduces the imbalance to 7.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 2
1 1000000000
1000000000 1
1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The current imbalance is 999999999. Adding a problem with complexity 1000000001 (1000000000 + 1) reduces the imbalance to 1.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
5 1 1
1 2 3 4 5
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The current imbalance is 1. No new problem can reduce this imbalance further.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2 100000 100000
1 1000000000
1 2 3 ... 100000
1 2 3 ... 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The current imbalance is 999999999. Adding a problem with complexity 1000000001 (1 + 1000000000) reduces the imbalance to 1.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases with small and large inputs, and scenarios where no new problem can reduce the imbalance further.
