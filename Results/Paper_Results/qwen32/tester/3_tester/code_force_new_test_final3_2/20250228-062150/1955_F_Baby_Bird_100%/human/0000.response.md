Certainly! Below are a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios. Each test case is well-documented with comments explaining the scenario it covers.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet. The XOR of 1, 2, and 3 is 0.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three. The remaining numbers are 2, 4, 4, and their XOR is 0.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Eve can remove numbers in such a way that Bob wins three times. For example, removing one 1, one 2, and one 3 leaves 1, 2, 3, and their XOR is 0.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Eve can remove numbers in such a way that Bob wins three times. For example, removing one 1, one 2, and one 3 leaves 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, and their XOR is 0.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
0 9 9 9
```
**Output**: 
```
12
```
**Explanation**: Eve can remove numbers in such a way that Bob wins twelve times. The XOR of any combination of twos, threes, and fours can be zero if Eve removes numbers optimally.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There are no numbers, so Bob cannot win.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
200 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The XOR of an even number of ones is zero, so Bob cannot win.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
0 200 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
**Explanation**: Eve can remove one two at a time, leaving an even number of twos each time, resulting in Bob winning 100 times.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 200 0
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
**Explanation**: Eve can remove one three at a time, leaving an even number of threes each time, resulting in Bob winning 100 times.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 0 200
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
**Explanation**: Eve can remove one four at a time, leaving an even number of fours each time, resulting in Bob winning 100 times.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There is only one number, so Bob cannot win.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There is only one number, so Bob cannot win.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There is only one number, so Bob cannot win.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There is only one number, so Bob cannot win.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet. The XOR of 1 and 2 is 3, which is non-zero, but removing one number leaves a single number which results in Bob winning.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet. The XOR of 1 and 3 is 2, which is non-zero, but removing one number leaves a single number which results in Bob winning.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet. The XOR of 2 and 3 is 1, which is non-zero, but removing one number leaves a single number which results in Bob winning.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet. The XOR of 3 and 4 is 7, which is non-zero, but removing one number leaves a single number which results in Bob winning.

# Test 19
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet. The XOR of 1, 2, 3, and 4 is 4, which is non-zero, but removing one number leaves a combination that can result in Bob winning.

# Test 20
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Eve can remove numbers in such a way that Bob wins twice. For example, removing one 2 and one 4 leaves 1, 2, 3, 4, and their XOR can be zero if Eve removes numbers optimally.
