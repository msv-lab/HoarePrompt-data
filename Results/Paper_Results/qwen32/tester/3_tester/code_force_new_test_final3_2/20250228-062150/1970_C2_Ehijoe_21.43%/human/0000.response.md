Sure, let's create comprehensive test cases for the given problem. We will cover both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
5 1
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: Starting from node 1, Ron can move to either node 2 or node 3. If Ron moves to node 3, Hermione can then move to node 4 or node 5, and Ron will always have a move as long as there are inactive neighbors.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
3 1
1 2
2 3
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: Starting from node 1, Ron can move to node 2, and then Hermione can move to node 3. Ron will lose as he has no more moves.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
3 1
1 2
2 3
3
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: Starting from node 3, Ron can only move to node 2, and Hermione can then move to node 1. Hermione wins as Ron has no more moves.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
2 1
1 2
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: Starting from node 1, Ron can move to node 2, and Hermione will have no moves left.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2 1
1 2
2
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: Starting from node 2, Ron can move to node 1, and Hermione will have no moves left.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
4 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: Starting from node 1, Ron can move to node 2, Hermione to node 3, and Ron to node 4. Ron wins as Hermione has no more moves.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
4 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: Starting from node 4, Ron can move to node 3, Hermione to node 2, and Ron to node 1. Hermione wins as Ron has no more moves.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
7 1
1 2
1 3
2 4
2 5
3 6
3 7
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: Starting from node 1, Ron can move to either node 2 or node 3, and the game will continue with Ron making the last move.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
7 1
1 2
1 3
2 4
2 5
3 6
3 7
7
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: Starting from node 7, Ron can only move to node 3, Hermione to node 1, Ron to node 2, Hermione to node 4 or 5, and Ron will eventually have no moves left.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
100000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
99999 100000
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: Starting from node 1, Ron can move to node 2, Hermione to node 3, and so on. Ron will always have a move as long as there are inactive neighbors.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
100000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
99999 100000
100000
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: Starting from node 100000, Ron can only move to node 99999, Hermione to node 99998, and so on. Hermione will eventually make the last move.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including small trees, large trees, trees with different structures, and edge cases with minimal nodes.
