Sure, let's create a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem. These test cases will cover both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the robustness and reliability of the solution.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
B
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The strip has only one cell which is black, so the minimum segment to paint is 1.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1
W
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Although the strip has only one cell which is white, the problem guarantees at least one black cell, so this is an edge case but still valid for completeness.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2
WB
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The strip has two cells, one white and one black. Painting the black cell (segment of length 1) will make the entire strip white.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2
BW
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Similar to the previous test case, painting the black cell (segment of length 1) will make the entire strip white.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3
BBW
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The strip has three cells, two black and one white. Painting the first two cells (segment of length 2) will make the entire strip white.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3
BWB
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The strip has three cells, two black and one white. Painting the first two cells (segment of length 2) or the last two cells (segment of length 2) will make the entire strip white.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4
BWWB
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The strip has four cells, two black and two white. Painting the entire strip (segment of length 4) is necessary to make it all white.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
5
BWBWB
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: The strip has five cells, all black. Painting the entire strip (segment of length 5) is necessary to make it all white.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10
BBBBBBBBBB
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: The strip has ten cells, all black. Painting the entire strip (segment of length 10) is necessary to make it all white.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
WWWWWWWWWW
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: Although the strip has ten cells, all white, the problem guarantees at least one black cell, so this is an edge case but still valid for completeness.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10
WBWBWBWBWB
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: The strip has ten cells, alternating black and white. Painting the entire strip (segment of length 10) is necessary to make it all white.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10
BBBBWBBBBB
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: The strip has ten cells, with a single white cell in the middle. Painting the entire strip (segment of length 10) is necessary to make it all white.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10
WWWWWWWWBB
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The strip has ten cells, with the last two cells black. Painting the last two cells (segment of length 2) will make the entire strip white.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10
BBWWWWWWWW
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The strip has ten cells, with the first two cells black. Painting the first two cells (segment of length 2) will make the entire strip white.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
10
WWWWWWWWWWB
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Although the strip has eleven cells, the problem guarantees at least one black cell, so this is an edge case but still valid for completeness.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
10
BWWWWWWWWW
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Although the strip has eleven cells, the problem guarantees at least one black cell, so this is an edge case but still valid for completeness.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
10
WBBWBBWBBW
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: The strip has ten cells, with black and white cells alternating. Painting the entire strip (segment of length 10) is necessary to make it all white.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
10
WWWWWWWWWWWW
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: Although the strip has twelve cells, the problem guarantees at least one black cell, so this is an edge case but still valid for completeness.

# Test 19
**Input**: 
```
1
10
BBBBBBBBBBB
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: Although the strip has eleven cells, the problem guarantees at least one black cell, so this is an edge case but still valid for completeness.

# Test 20
**Input**: 
```
1
10
BBBBBBBBBBW
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: Although the strip has eleven cells, the problem guarantees at least one black cell, so this is an edge case but still valid for completeness.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic functionality and edge cases, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
