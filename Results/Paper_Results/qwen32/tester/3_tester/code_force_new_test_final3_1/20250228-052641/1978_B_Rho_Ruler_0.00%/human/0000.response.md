```
1
5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
25
```
**Scenario**: The usual price and the modified price for the first bun are equal, selling all at the usual price is optimal.

**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
26
```
**Scenario**: The modified price is slightly higher than the usual price, selling the first bun at the modified price is optimal.

**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 15
```
**Output**: 
```
110
```
**Scenario**: The modified price is significantly higher than the usual price, selling the first few buns at the modified price is optimal.

**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000
```
