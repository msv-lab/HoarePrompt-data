Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: As per the example, after the initial move and the computer's mirrored move, there are 3 possible final configurations.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 0
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: With no initial moves, all 9 positions are available for the first move, leading to 9 possible configurations.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The only position is taken, and the computer skips its turn since r = c. No further moves are possible.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2
1 2
3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: After two moves and their mirrors, 9 positions are still available, leading to 9 possible configurations.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With a 1x1 board and no initial moves, there is only one possible configuration.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The single position is taken, and no further moves are possible.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: With no initial moves, all 4 positions are available for the first move, leading to 4 possible configurations.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The only position is taken, and the computer skips its turn since r = c. No further moves are possible.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
1 1
2 2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: All positions are taken, and no further moves are possible.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 0
```
**Output**: 
```
100000000000000
```
**Explanation**: With no initial moves, all 100000x100000 positions are available, leading to 100000^2 possible configurations. However, due to modulo 10^9+7, the output is 100000000000000 % 1000000007 = 671968183.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
9999800001
```
**Explanation**: After the initial move at (1,1), 99999 positions are still available. The output is 9999800001 % 1000000007 = 671968183.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 50000
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 4
5 5
...
50000 50000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: All 50000 positions on the diagonal are taken, and no further moves are possible.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 49999
1 1
2 2
3 3
...
49999 49999
```
**Output**: 
```
5000100000
```
**Explanation**: After 49999 moves on the diagonal, 50001 positions are still available. The output is 5000100000 % 1000000007 = 671968183.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 100000
1 1
2 2
3 3
...
100000 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: All positions are taken, and no further moves are possible.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: After the initial move and the computer's mirrored move, 4 positions are still available, leading to 4 possible configurations.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
1 2
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: After two moves and their mirrors, 2 positions are still available, leading to 2 possible configurations.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases with small and large board sizes, and various initial move configurations.
