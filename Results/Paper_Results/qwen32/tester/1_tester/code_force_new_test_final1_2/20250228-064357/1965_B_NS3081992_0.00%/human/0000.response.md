Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
**Explanation**: We need a subsequence that adds up to 1, but not one that adds up to 2. The sequence [1] satisfies this.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
6 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
2 3 4 5 6
```
**Explanation**: All elements are greater than k=1, so no subsequence adds up to 1. Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
8 8
```
**Output**: 
```
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: We need to avoid creating a subsequence that sums to 8. Using multiple 1s ensures that no subsequence sums to 8, while still allowing all other sums from 1 to 7.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
9 3
```
**Output**: 
```
4
7 1 4 1
```
**Explanation**: The sequence [7, 1, 4, 1] avoids creating a subsequence that sums to 3 while allowing all other sums from 1 to 9.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10 7
```
**Output**: 
```
4
1 2 8 3
```
**Explanation**: The sequence [1, 2, 8, 3] avoids creating a subsequence that sums to 7 while allowing all other sums from 1 to 10.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
999999
2 3 4 5 ... 1000000
```
**Explanation**: All elements are greater than k=1, so no subsequence adds up to 1. Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
999999
1 1 1 1 ... 1 (999999 ones)
```
**Explanation**: Using multiple 1s ensures that no subsequence sums to 1000000, while still allowing all other sums from 1 to 999999.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
25 25
```
**Output**: 
```
24
1 1 1 1 ... 1 (24 ones)
```
**Explanation**: Using multiple 1s ensures that no subsequence sums to 25, while still allowing all other sums from 1 to 24.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
25 1
```
**Output**: 
```
24
2 3 4 5 ... 25
```
**Explanation**: All elements are greater than k=1, so no subsequence adds up to 1. Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
5
2 2
6 1
8 8
9 3
10 7
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
5
2 3 4 5 6
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
4
7 1 4 1
4
1 2 8 3
```
**Explanation**: This is a combination of the first five test cases, verifying the function's consistency across multiple test cases.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
2
```
**Explanation**: All elements are greater than k=1, so no subsequence adds up to 1. Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10 5
```
**Output**: 
```
5
1 2 3 4 6
```
**Explanation**: The sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 6] avoids creating a subsequence that sums to 5 while allowing all other sums from 1 to 10.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
9
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: Using multiple 1s ensures that no subsequence sums to 10, while still allowing all other sums from 1 to 9.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
20 15
```
**Output**: 
```
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 16
```
**Explanation**: The sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 16] avoids creating a subsequence that sums to 15 while allowing all other sums from 1 to 20.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
25 20
```
**Output**: 
```
15
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 21
```
**Explanation**: The sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 21] avoids creating a subsequence that sums to 20 while allowing all other sums from 1 to 25.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the solution.
