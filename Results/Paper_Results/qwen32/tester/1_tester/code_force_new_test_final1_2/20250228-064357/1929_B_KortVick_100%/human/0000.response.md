# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 399999997
```
**Output**: 
```
99999999
```
**Explanation**: In a 100000000x100000000 grid, we need to cover 399999997 diagonals. By coloring 99999999 cells, we can cover 399999997 diagonals.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 400000001
```
**Output**: 
```
100000000
```
**Explanation**: In a 100000000x100000000 grid, there are only 399999998 diagonals (4n-2 = 4*100000000-2 = 399999998). To cover all 399999998 diagonals, we need to color 100000000 cells.
