Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The initial XOR of the sequence [1, 2, 3] is 0 (1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0), so Bob wins. No further removals can change this.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The initial XOR of the sequence [1, 3, 2, 2, 4] is 0 (1 XOR 3 XOR 2 XOR 2 XOR 4 = 0), so Bob wins. Eve can remove one 1 and one 3 to keep the XOR 0.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The initial XOR of the sequence [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3] is non-zero. Eve can remove numbers to maximize Bob's wins. For example, removing one 1, one 2, and one 3 at each step results in Bob winning 3 times.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The initial XOR of the sequence [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3] is non-zero. Eve can remove numbers to maximize Bob's wins. For example, removing one 1, one 2, and one 3 at each step results in Bob winning 3 times.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
0 9 9 9
```
**Output**: 
```
12
```
**Explanation**: The initial XOR of the sequence [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4] is non-zero. Eve can remove numbers to maximize Bob's wins. Since there are no 1s, each removal of a pair (2, 2), (3, 3), or (4, 4) keeps the XOR 0, resulting in Bob winning 12 times.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The sequence is empty, so no games are played.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: The initial XOR of the sequence [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4] is non-zero. Eve can remove numbers to maximize Bob's wins. For example, removing one 1, one 2, one 3, and one 4 at each step results in Bob winning 6 times.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The initial XOR of the sequence [1] is non-zero, so Alice wins. No further removals can change this.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The initial XOR of the sequence [2] is non-zero, so Alice wins. No further removals can change this.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The initial XOR of the sequence [3] is non-zero, so Alice wins. No further removals can change this.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The initial XOR of the sequence [4] is non-zero, so Alice wins. No further removals can change this.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The initial XOR of the sequence [1, 1] is 0, so Bob wins. No further removals can change this.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
0 2 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The initial XOR of the sequence [2, 2] is 0, so Bob wins. No further removals can change this.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The initial XOR of the sequence [3, 3] is 0, so Bob wins. No further removals can change this.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 0 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The initial XOR of the sequence [4, 4] is 0, so Bob wins. No further removals can change this.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The initial XOR of the sequence [1, 2] is non-zero, so Alice wins. No further removals can change this.

```
1
0 1 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The initial XOR of the sequence [2, 3] is non-zero, so Alice wins. No further removals can change this.
