**Role**: As a tester, your task is to create comprehensive test cases for the following coding problem. These test cases should encompass Basic and Edge scenarios to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

**Problem Description**:
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

**1. Basic Test Cases**:
- **Objective**: To verify the fundamental functionality of the `has_close_elements` function under normal conditions.

**2. Edge Test Cases**:
- **Objective**: To evaluate the function's behavior under extreme or unusual conditions.

**Instructions**:
- Implement a comprehensive set of test cases following the guidelines above.
- Ensure each test case is complete (no omission) and well-documented with comments explaining the scenario it covers.
- Pay special attention to edge cases as they often reveal hidden bugs.
- Do not repeat, do not summarize.

All test cases you give need to strictly follow the problem description and format like this:
# Test 1
**Input**: 
```

```
**Output**: 
```
