# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
1 2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: Both monsters will move towards the character and kill it since we can only shoot one monster per second.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1
-1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES

**Explanation**: We can kill the monster in one shot before it reaches the character.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
2
-2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The monster will move one step closer each second and will reach the character before we can kill it.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2
1
-1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: We have more bullets than needed to kill the monster in one shot.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
1 1 1
-3 -2 -1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: We can kill all monsters in one second since we have enough bullets.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
1 1 1
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: All monsters will move towards the character, and we cannot kill them all before they reach it.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000
1000000000
-1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: With a large number of bullets, we can easily kill the monster before it reaches the character.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The monster will move towards the character and kill it since it starts at position 1.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
1 1
-1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: We can only kill one monster per second, and the other will reach the character.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000
1
-1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: With a large number of bullets, we can easily kill the monster before it reaches the character.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
1 1 1
-3 -2 -1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: We can kill all monsters in one second since we have enough bullets.

**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
1 1 1
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: All monsters will move towards the character, and we cannot kill them all before they reach it.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1
-1
```
**Output**: 
```
