# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 3 1 5
3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: At moment 0, the phone has 3 units of charge. Sending a message at moment 3 would consume 3 units of charge, leaving 0 units. Since the phone cannot be turned off and on again at this point, it's impossible to send the message.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
7 21 1 3
4 6 10 13 17 20 26
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Stepan can turn off and on the phone strategically to ensure he has enough charge to send all messages.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5 10 1 2
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Stepan can send messages one after another without needing to turn the phone off and on, as the charge consumption per unit time is low compared to the initial charge.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The initial charge is very high, but the charge consumption per unit time and turning on/off the phone is also very high, making it impossible to send the message at the given moment.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3 11 9 6
6 8 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The charge consumption per unit time is high, and the intervals between messages are short, making it impossible to send all messages without running out of charge.
