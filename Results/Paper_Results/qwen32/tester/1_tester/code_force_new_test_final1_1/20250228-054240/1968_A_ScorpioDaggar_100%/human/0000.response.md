```
1
6
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: For x = 6, y = 3 gives gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6, which is maximum.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3
```

```
1
5
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: For x = 5, y = 4 gives gcd(5, 4) + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5, which is maximum.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
8
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
**Explanation**: For x = 8, y = 7 gives gcd(8, 7) + 7 = 1 + 7 = 8, which is maximum.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
9
```
**Output**: 
```
8
```
**Explanation**: For x = 9, y = 8 gives gcd(9, 8) + 8 = 1 + 8 = 9, which is maximum.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
12
```
**Output**: 
```
11
```
**Explanation**: For x = 12, y = 11 gives gcd(12, 11) + 11 = 1 + 11 = 12, which is maximum.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
1001
```
**Output**: 
```
500
```
**Explanation**: Although x = 1001 is out of bounds, if we hypothetically consider it, y = 500 gives gcd(1001, 500) + 500 = 1 + 500 = 501, which is less than 1001. However, within bounds, y = 999 is a valid choice.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
1000
```
**Output**: 
```
750
```
**Explanation**: For x = 1000, y = 750 gives gcd(1000, 750) + 750 = 250 + 750 = 1000, which is maximum.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
11
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: For x = 11, y = 10 gives gcd(11, 10) + 10 = 1 + 10 = 11, which is maximum.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
13
```
**Output**: 
```
12
```
**Explanation**: For x = 13, y = 12 gives gcd(13, 12) + 12 = 1 + 12 = 13, which is maximum.

# Test 19
**Input**: 
```
1
19
```
**Output**: 
```
18
```
**Explanation**: For x = 19, y = 18 gives gcd(19, 18) + 18 = 1 + 18 = 19, which is maximum.

# Test 20

```
1
23
```
**Output**: 
```
22
```
**Explanation**: For x = 23, y = 22 gives gcd(23, 22) + 22 = 1 + 22 = 23, which is maximum.
