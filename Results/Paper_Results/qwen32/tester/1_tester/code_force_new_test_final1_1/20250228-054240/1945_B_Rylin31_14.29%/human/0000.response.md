Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
6 7 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: After 7 minutes, one firework from the first installation and one from the second installation are visible simultaneously.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 4 10
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
**Explanation**: At t=12, fireworks from both installations overlap, resulting in the maximum of 7 fireworks visible simultaneously.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
7 8 56
```
**Output**: 
```
17
```
**Explanation**: At t=112, 9 fireworks from the first installation and 8 from the second installation are visible simultaneously, totaling 17.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 6 78123459896
```
**Output**: 
```
28645268630
```
**Explanation**: At the least common multiple of 5 and 6 (i.e., 30), the fireworks overlap significantly within the visibility period, resulting in a large number of simultaneous fireworks.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: Every second, fireworks from both installations overlap, leading to a maximum of 4 fireworks visible simultaneously.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
2000000000000000002
```
**Explanation**: Since both installations launch fireworks every second, they overlap completely, resulting in a very large number of simultaneous fireworks.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000 1000000000000000000 1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Both installations launch fireworks at the same interval, but they only overlap once within the visibility period, resulting in a maximum of 2 fireworks visible simultaneously.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Fireworks from both installations overlap at every second and the second installation launches an additional firework every other second, resulting in a maximum of 3 fireworks visible simultaneously.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: At t=6, fireworks from both installations overlap, and within the visibility period, a maximum of 4 fireworks are visible simultaneously.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10 15 20
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: At t=30, fireworks from both installations overlap, and within the visibility period, a maximum of 9 fireworks are visible simultaneously.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100 100 100
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Fireworks from both installations overlap every 100 minutes, resulting in a maximum of 3 fireworks visible simultaneously.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000000000000 1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000000000002
```
**Explanation**: The second installation launches a single firework at the start, and fireworks from the first installation overlap with it, resulting in a large number of simultaneous fireworks.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000 1 1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000000000002
```
**Explanation**: The first installation launches a single firework at the start, and fireworks from the second installation overlap with it, resulting in a large number of simultaneous fireworks.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: Fireworks from both installations overlap at every second and the second installation launches an additional firework every other second, resulting in a maximum of 4 fireworks visible simultaneously.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: Fireworks from both installations overlap at every second and the first installation launches an additional firework every other second, resulting in a maximum of 4 fireworks visible simultaneously.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases with large numbers, and scenarios with overlapping intervals.
