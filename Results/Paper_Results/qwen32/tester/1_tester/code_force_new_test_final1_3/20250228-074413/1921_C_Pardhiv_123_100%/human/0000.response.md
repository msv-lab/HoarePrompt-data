Sure, let's create a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem. We'll start with basic test cases and then move on to edge cases.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 3 1 5
3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 3 units of charge. Sending a message at moment 3 would consume 3 units of charge, leaving the phone with 0 units of charge, which is not allowed.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1 4 1 5
3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 4 units of charge. Sending a message at moment 3 would consume 3 units of charge, leaving the phone with 1 unit of charge, which is sufficient.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 5 1 2
2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 5 units of charge. Sending a message at moment 2 consumes 2 units, leaving 3 units. Sending a message at moment 4 consumes 2 more units, leaving 1 unit, which is sufficient.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2 5 2 2
2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 5 units of charge. Sending a message at moment 2 consumes 4 units (2 units for time and 2 for turning off/on), leaving 1 unit. Sending a message at moment 4 consumes 4 more units, which is not possible.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000 1 1000000000
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with a very high charge. Sending a message at a very high moment consumes a lot of charge, but it is still possible with the initial charge.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000 1000000000 1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with a very high charge but consumes a lot of charge per unit time, making it impossible to send the message at a very high moment.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 1 1
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 10 units of charge. Sending messages at each moment consumes 1 unit of charge per moment and 1 unit for turning off/on, which is feasible with the initial charge.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 1 10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 10 units of charge. Sending messages at each moment consumes 1 unit of charge per moment and 10 units for turning off/on, which is not feasible.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1 3 1 4
2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 3 units of charge. Sending a message at moment 2 consumes 2 units, leaving 1 unit. Turning off and on consumes 4 units, which is not possible.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10 1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 10 units of charge. Sending a message at moment 1 consumes 1 unit, leaving 9 units, which is sufficient.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
3 11 9 6
6 8 10
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 11 units of charge. Sending messages at moments 6, 8, and 10 with the given constraints is feasible.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
3 10 9 6
6 8 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 10 units of charge. Sending messages at moments 6, 8, and 10 with the given constraints is not feasible due to insufficient charge.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 1 unit of charge. Sending a message at moment 1 consumes 1 unit, leaving 0 units, which is not allowed.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2 1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 2 units of charge. Sending a message at moment 1 consumes 1 unit, leaving 1 unit, which is sufficient.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10 1 10
1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 10 units of charge. Sending a message at moment 1 consumes 1 unit, leaving 9 units. Turning off and on consumes 10 units, which is not possible.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic functionality and edge cases, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the solution.
