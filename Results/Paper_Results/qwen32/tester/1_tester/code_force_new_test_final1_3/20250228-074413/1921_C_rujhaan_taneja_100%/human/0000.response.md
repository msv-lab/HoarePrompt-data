Certainly! Below are the comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both Basic and Edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 3 1 5
3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: At moment 0, the phone has 3 units of charge. Sending the message at moment 3 consumes 3 units of charge, leaving 0 units. Since the phone cannot be turned off and on without additional charge, it's impossible to send the message.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1 3 1 2
3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: Similar to Test 1, but with a smaller turning on/off cost. The phone still cannot send the message at moment 3 without running out of charge.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1 5 1 2
3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone has 5 units of charge initially. It can turn off and on at moment 0, costing 2 units, leaving 3 units. It then sends the message at moment 3, consuming 3 units, leaving 0 units of charge, but the message is sent successfully.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2 10 1 2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone can send the first message at moment 1 without turning off. It then turns off and on at moment 1, costing 2 units, leaving 8 units. It sends the second message at moment 3, consuming 2 units, leaving 6 units of charge.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5 10 1 2
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone can turn off and on at each message moment, costing 2 units each time. It sends each message at its respective moment, consuming 1 unit each time, leaving sufficient charge.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone has 1 unit of charge initially, but the turning on/off cost and the time consumption are extremely high, making it impossible to send the message.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3 11 9 6
6 8 10
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone can turn off and on at moment 6, costing 6 units, leaving 5 units. It sends the message at moment 6, consuming 0 units (since it's turned on at the same moment). It then turns off and on at moment 8, costing 6 units, leaving -1 units, but it sends the message at moment 8, consuming 2 units, leaving 3 units. It turns off and on at moment 10, costing 6 units, leaving -3 units, but it sends the message at moment 10, consuming 4 units, leaving -7 units, but the message is sent successfully.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 10 1 2
1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone can send the first message at moment 1 without turning off. It then turns off and on at moment 1, costing 2 units, leaving 8 units. It sends the second message at moment 1000000000, consuming 999999999 units, leaving -999999991 units, but the message is sent successfully.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2 10 1 10
1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone can send the first message at moment 1 without turning off. It then turns off and on at moment 1, costing 10 units, leaving 0 units. It cannot send the second message at moment 1000000000 due to insufficient charge.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2147483647 1 1
2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone has a very high initial charge. It can turn off and on at moment 0, costing 1 unit, leaving 2147483646 units. It sends the message at moment 2147483647, consuming 2147483646 units, leaving 0 units of charge, but the message is sent successfully.

# Test 11

1 2147483647 1 2147483647
2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone has a very high initial charge, but the turning on/off cost is extremely high, making it impossible to send the message.
