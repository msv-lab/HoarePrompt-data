# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```

```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to choose (l, r) = (1, 3), changing the array to [2, 2, 2]. The maximum possible value is 2.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```

```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to choose (l, r) = (1, 3) or (2, 4), changing the array to [2, 2, 2, 4] or [1, 2, 3, 3]. Further operations can reach [2, 2, 2, 2]. The maximum possible value is 2.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operations are to choose (l, r) = (4, 5), then (3, 5), and finally (1, 5), changing the array to [4, 4, 4, 4, 4]. The maximum possible value is 4.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 3 5 7 9 11
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operations can lead to the array being changed to [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]. The maximum possible value is 6.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operations can lead to the array being changed to [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]. The maximum possible value is 4.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
8
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operations can lead to the array being changed to [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]. The maximum possible value is 5.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operations can lead to the array being changed to [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]. The maximum possible value is 5.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operations can lead to the array being changed to [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]. The maximum possible value is 6.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 1 1 1 1 ... 1 (100000 times)
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The array is already uniform, so no operations are needed. The maximum possible value is 1.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 2 3 4 5 ... 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
50000
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operations can lead to the array being changed to [50000, 50000, ..., 50000]. The maximum possible value is 50000.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
2
2
1000000000 1000000000
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000
5
```
**Explanation**: The first array is already uniform, so no operations are needed. The maximum possible value is 1000000000. The second array can be changed to [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]. The maximum possible value is 5.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: The array is already uniform, so no operations are needed. The maximum possible value is 5.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1 5 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to choose (l, r) = (1, 5), changing the array to [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. The maximum possible value is 1.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 3 3 3 5
```
**Output**: 
```

```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to choose (l, r) = (1, 5), changing the array to [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]. The maximum possible value is 3.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including small arrays, large arrays, arrays with all identical elements, and arrays with a mix of different elements. They also test the edge cases such as the smallest and largest possible input sizes and values.
