# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Only one island exists, so no bridges are present to destroy.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
100 0
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
**Explanation**: No bridges are destroyed, so Everule can visit all 100 islands.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
100 4950
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: All possible bridges are destroyed, isolating island 1.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
5 10
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Destroying 10 bridges (which is the maximum possible for 5 islands) isolates island 1.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
6 15
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Destroying 15 bridges (which is the maximum possible for 6 islands) isolates island 1.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
7 21
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Destroying 21 bridges (which is the maximum possible for 7 islands) isolates island 1.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Destroying 4 bridges (which is the maximum possible for 4 islands) isolates island 1.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
5 3
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: Destroying 3 bridges does not isolate any island from island 1.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
6 5
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: Destroying 5 bridges does not isolate any island from island 1.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
7 6
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
**Explanation**: Destroying 6 bridges does not isolate any island from island 1.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
10 45
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Destroying 45 bridges (which is the maximum possible for 10 islands) isolates island 1.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
10 44
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: Destroying 44 bridges does not isolate any island from island 1.
