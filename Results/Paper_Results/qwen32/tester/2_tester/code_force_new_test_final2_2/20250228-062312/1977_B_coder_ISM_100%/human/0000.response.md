```
**Explanation**: The value 2^30, which is the upper limit for x.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
31
-1 0 1 0 -1 0 1 0 -1 0 1 0 -1 0 1 0 -1 0 1 0 -1 0 1 0 -1 0 1 0 -1 0 1
```
**Explanation**: The largest possible value for x, which is 2^31 - 1. This requires alternating 1s and -1s.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1048575
```
**Output**: 
```
20
-1 0 1 0 -1 0 1 0 -1 0 1 0 -1 0 1 0 -1 0 1 0
```
**Explanation**: A large value that requires a combination of 1s and -1s to represent.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
512
```
**Output**: 
```
10
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
```
**Explanation**: A power of 2 that requires a single 1 at the 9th position.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
1023
```
**Output**: 
```
10
-1 0 1 0 -1 0 1 0 -1 0
```
**Explanation**: The largest value that can be represented with 10 bits using 1s and -1s.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
511
```
**Output**: 
```
9
1 0 -1 0 1 0 -1 0 1
```
**Explanation**: The value 511, which is 2^9 - 1, represented using alternating 1s and -1s.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
