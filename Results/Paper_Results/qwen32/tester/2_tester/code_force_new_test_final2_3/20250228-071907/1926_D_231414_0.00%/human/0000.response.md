```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The numbers need to be grouped based on their last 31 bits.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4
688873446 627404104 1520079543 1458610201
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The numbers need to be grouped based on their last 31 bits.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Only one number, so it can be in a single group.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1
2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Only one number, so it can be in a single group.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Both numbers are the same, so they need to be in different groups.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
2147483647 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Both numbers are the same, so they need to be in different groups.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1073741823 1073741823
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Both numbers are the same, so they need to be in different groups.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 0 2147483647 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Pairs (0, 0) and (2147483647, 2147483647) need to be in different groups.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Pairs (0, 0) need to be in different groups, and 2147483647 can be in the same group as one of the zeros.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
8
1858058912 289424735 1858058912 2024818580 1858058912 289424735 122665067 289424735
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The numbers need to be grouped based on their last 31 bits.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 2 3 4 5 ... 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This is a large input where all numbers are unique in their last 31 bits.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
0 0 0 0 ... 0
```
**Output**: 
```
100000
```
**Explanation**: All numbers are the same, so each number must be in its own group.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
2147483647 2147483647 2147483647 ... 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
100000
```
**Explanation**: All numbers are the same, so each number must be in its own group.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
10000
