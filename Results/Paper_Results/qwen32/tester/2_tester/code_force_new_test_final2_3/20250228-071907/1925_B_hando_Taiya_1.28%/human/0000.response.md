Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3
10 3
5 5
420 69
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1
6
```
**Explanation**: This is the example provided in the problem statement. It covers basic functionality with different values of x and n.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The simplest case where x and n are both 1. The only possible sub-problem has difficulty 1, so the balance is 1.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
100000000
```
**Explanation**: When n is 1, the entire problem can be a single sub-problem with difficulty x. Thus, the balance is x itself.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 100000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: When n is equal to x, the only way to split the problem is into n sub-problems each with difficulty 1. Thus, the balance is 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
100 10
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: The optimal way to split 100 into 10 sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with difficulty 10, giving a balance of 10.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
20 2
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: The optimal way to split 20 into 2 sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with difficulty 10, giving a balance of 10.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
101 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The optimal way to split 101 into 2 sub-problems is to have difficulties 50 and 51, giving a balance of 1.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
100 5
```
**Output**: 
```
20
```
**Explanation**: The optimal way to split 100 into 5 sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with difficulty 20, giving a balance of 20.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
100 3
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: The optimal way to split 100 into 3 sub-problems is to have difficulties 34, 33, and 33, giving a balance of 1.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
99999999 99999999
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: When n is equal to x-1, the only way to split the problem into n sub-problems is to have one sub-problem with difficulty 1 and the rest with difficulty 1, giving a balance of 1.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
99999999 100000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: When n is slightly larger than x, the only way to split the problem is into n sub-problems with most having difficulty 1, giving a balance of 1.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
99999999 50000000
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: When n is half of x, the optimal way is to split the problem into sub-problems with difficulties that share a common divisor, giving a balance of 3.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 2
```
**Output**: 
```
50000000
```
**Explanation**: When n is 2, the optimal way to split 100000000 is into two sub-problems with difficulty 50000000, giving a balance of 50000000.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
99999999 3
```
**Output**: 
```
33333333
```
**Explanation**: When n is 3, the optimal way to split 99999999 is into three sub-problems with difficulty 33333333, giving a balance of 33333333.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including edge cases where n is 1 or equal to x, and typical cases with varying values of x and n.
