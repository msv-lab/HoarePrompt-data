Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the described problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
5 1
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: Ron starts at node 1. He can move to node 2 or 3. If he moves to node 2, Hermione can move to node 1 or 3. If Hermione moves to node 3, Ron can move to node 4 or 5, and Hermione will be unable to move, so Ron wins.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
4 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: Ron starts at node 4. He can only move to node 3. Hermione then moves to node 2, and Ron moves to node 1. Hermione is then unable to move, so Hermione wins.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
3 1
1 2
2 3
2
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: Ron starts at node 2. He can move to node 1 or 3. If he moves to node 1, Hermione can only move to node 2, and Ron will be unable to move, so Hermione wins. However, if Ron moves to node 3, Hermione can only move to node 2, and Ron will be unable to move, so Ron wins.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
6 1
1 2
1 3
1 4
4 5
4 6
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: Ron starts at node 1. He can move to node 2, 3, or 4. If he moves to node 4, Hermione can move to node 5 or 6. Ron can then move to node 1, 5, or 6, and Hermione will be unable to move, so Ron wins.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2 1
1 2
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: Ron starts at node 1. He can move to node 2, and Hermione will be unable to move, so Ron wins.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
2 1
1 2
2
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: Ron starts at node 2. He can move to node 1, and Hermione will be unable to move, so Hermione wins.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
3 1
1 2
2 3
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: Ron starts at node 1. He can move to node 2. Hermione can then move to node 3, and Ron will be unable to move, so Hermione wins. However, if Ron moves to node 3, Hermione can only move to node 2, and Ron will be unable to move, so Ron wins.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
10 1
1 2
1 3
1 4
1 5
1 6
1 7
1 8
1 9
1 10
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: Ron starts at node 1. He can move to any of the other nodes. Hermione can then move to another node, and Ron can continue to move until Hermione is unable to move, so Ron wins.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
100000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
99999 100000
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: Ron starts at node 1. He can move to node 2. Hermione can then move to node 3, and Ron can continue to move until Hermione is unable to move, so Ron wins. This tests the scalability of the solution with the maximum number of nodes.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
100000 1
1 2
1 3
1 4
...
99999 100000
100000
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: Ron starts at node 100000. He can move to node 99999. Hermione can then move to node 99998, and Ron can continue to move until he is unable to move, so Hermione wins. This tests the scalability of the solution with the maximum number of nodes and the last node as the starting node.
