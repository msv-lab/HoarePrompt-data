Certainly! Below are a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3
3
2 2 8
4
7 3 3 1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
2
1
```
**Explanation**: 
- For the first test case, increasing the first element to 3 makes the median 3.
- For the second test case, increasing the first three elements to 6 makes the median 6.
- For the third test case, the array has only one element, so the median is already the maximum possible value.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
2
5
5 5 5 4 5
6
2 1 2 3 1 4
```
**Output**: 
```
3
2
```
**Explanation**: 
- For the first test case, increasing the fourth element to 5 makes the median 5.
- For the second test case, increasing the first and third elements to 3 makes the median 3.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: 
- With only one element, the median is the element itself. Increasing it by 1 increases the median.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: 
- The median of the array [1, 1] is 1. To increase the median, both elements need to be increased to at least 2.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: 
- The median of the array [1, 2] is 1. To increase the median, both elements need to be increased to at least 2.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
4
5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: 
- The median of the array [5, 5, 5, 5] is 5. To increase the median, three elements need to be increased to at least 6.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 1 1 ... 1 (100000 ones)
```
**Output**: 
```
50000
```
**Explanation**: 
- The median of an array of 100000 ones is 1. To increase the median, the first 50000 elements need to be increased to at least 2.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 2 3 ... 100000 (increasing sequence)
```
**Output**: 
```
50000
```
**Explanation**: 
- The median of an increasing sequence of 100000 elements is 50000. To increase the median, the first 50000 elements need to be increased to at least 50001.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
100000 99999 99998 ... 1 (decreasing sequence)
```
**Output**: 
```
50000
```
**Explanation**: 
- The median of a decreasing sequence of 100000 elements is 50001. To increase the median, the first 50000 elements need to be increased to at least 50002.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 1 1 ... 1 1000000000 (99999 ones and one large number)
```
**Output**: 
```
50000
```
**Explanation**: 
- The median of an array with 99999 ones and one large number is 1. To increase the median, the first 50000 elements need to be increased to at least 2.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 ... 1000000000 (100000 large numbers)
```
**Output**: 
```
50000
```
**Explanation**: 
- The median of an array of 100000 large numbers is the large number itself. To increase the median, the first 50000 elements need to be increased to a larger value.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
99999
1 1 1 ... 1 (99999 ones)
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
49999
1
```
**Explanation**: 
- The median of an array of 99999 ones is 1. To increase the median, the first 49999 elements need to be increased to at least 2.
- The median of an array with a single element is the element itself. Increasing it by 1 increases the median.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases with small and large inputs, and various configurations of array elements.
