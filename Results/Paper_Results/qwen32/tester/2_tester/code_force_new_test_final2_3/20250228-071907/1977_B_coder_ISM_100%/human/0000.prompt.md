**Role**: As a tester, your task is to create comprehensive test cases for the following coding problem. These test cases should encompass Basic and Edge scenarios to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

**Problem Description**:
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1
    
    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1
    6
    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

**1. Basic Test Cases**:
- **Objective**: To verify the fundamental functionality of the `has_close_elements` function under normal conditions.

**2. Edge Test Cases**:
- **Objective**: To evaluate the function's behavior under extreme or unusual conditions.

**Instructions**:
- Implement a comprehensive set of test cases following the guidelines above.
- Ensure each test case is complete (no omission) and well-documented with comments explaining the scenario it covers.
- Pay special attention to edge cases as they often reveal hidden bugs.
- Do not repeat, do not summarize.

All test cases you give need to strictly follow the problem description and format like this:
# Test 1
**Input**: 
```

```
**Output**: 
```
