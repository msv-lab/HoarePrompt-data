50
20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: With 50 outcomes and varying multipliers, it's impossible to distribute the bets such that the return is strictly greater than the total bet for any outcome.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
1
20
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The only outcome has a multiplier of 20, so betting 1 coin will result in a return of 20, which is greater than 1.
