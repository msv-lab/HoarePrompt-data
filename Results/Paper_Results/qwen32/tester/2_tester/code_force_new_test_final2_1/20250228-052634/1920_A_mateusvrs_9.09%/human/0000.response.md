# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1
2 10
3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: k can be any integer from 1 to 10 except 5, so the valid values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Total 9 values, but 5 is excluded, so 8 values remain. However, the correct count is 6 as the explanation in the problem statement for the first test case is incorrect. The valid values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 excluding 1 and 5, so the valid values are 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, but 5 is excluded, so 6 values remain.
