```
1
6 1
```

```
1
8 8
```
**Output**: 
```
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: All values from 1 to 7 can be formed by subsequences, and the sum of 8 is not possible.

# Test 4
**Input**:

**Input**: 
```
1
25 25
```
**Output**: 
```
24
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: All sums from 1 to 24 can be formed, and the sum of 25 is not possible.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
