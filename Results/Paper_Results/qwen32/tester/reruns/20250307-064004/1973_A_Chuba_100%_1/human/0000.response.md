Sure, let's create comprehensive test cases for the given problem. We'll cover both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the robustness and reliability of the solution.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: No games were played, so no draws could occur.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: One game was played between the second and third player, resulting in a draw.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Two games were played: one draw between the second and third player, and a win for the third player against the first player.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: It's impossible to have all three players with the same score of 3 without any player winning more games than possible.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: The maximum number of draws is 6, which can be achieved through a combination of wins and draws.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 10
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: It's impossible to have a player with 10 points with the given constraints, so the maximum number of draws is 2, which can be achieved with a combination of wins and draws.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The only way to achieve this score is if the third player won both games, with no draws.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
0 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: One game was played between the second and third player resulting in a draw, and the third player won against the first player.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
0 2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: It's impossible to have scores of 0, 2, and 4 because the third player would need to win 4 games, which isn't possible with the given constraints.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: It's impossible to have scores of 1, 2, and 3 because the third player would need to win 3 games, which isn't possible with the given constraints.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Two games were played between the second and third player resulting in two draws, and the third player won both games against the first player.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2 4 6
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: It's impossible to have scores of 2, 4, and 6 because the third player would need to win 6 games, which isn't possible with the given constraints.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
30 30 30
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: It's impossible to have all three players with the same score of 30 without any player winning more games than possible.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
15 15 30
```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
**Explanation**: The maximum number of draws is 15, which can be achieved through a combination of wins and draws.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
0 15 30
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The only way to achieve this score is if the third player won all 15 games against the second player and all 15 games against the first player, with no draws.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic functionality and edge cases, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
