Sure, let's create comprehensive test cases for the given problem. We'll start with basic test cases and then move on to edge cases.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2
1
1 1
```
**Explanation**: 
- For n=2 and k=3, we can assign a_1=1 and a_2=2. The condition |i-j| + |a_i-a_j| ≤ k is satisfied for the pair (1,2), so they form a single clique.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 3 2
2
1 2 2
```
**Explanation**: 
- For n=3 and k=3, we can assign a_1=1, a_2=3, and a_3=2. The pairs (1,2) and (2,3) do not satisfy the condition, but (1,3) does. Thus, vertices 1 and 3 form one clique, and vertex 2 forms another.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4
1
1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: 
- For n=4 and k=5, we can assign a_1=1, a_2=2, a_3=3, and a_4=4. The condition is satisfied for all pairs, so all vertices form a single clique.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2
2
1 2
```
**Explanation**: 
- For n=2 and k=1, the condition |i-j| + |a_i-a_j| ≤ k is not satisfied for the pair (1,2) regardless of the assignment, so they must be in separate cliques.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 3 2 4
2
1 2 1 2
```
**Explanation**: 
- For n=4 and k=2, we can assign a_1=1, a_2=3, a_3=2, and a_4=4. The pairs (1,2) and (3,4) satisfy the condition, but (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), and (2,4) do not. Thus, vertices 1 and 3 form one clique, and vertices 2 and 4 form another.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4 5
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Explanation**: 
- For n=5 and k=1, the condition |i-j| + |a_i-a_j| ≤ k is not satisfied for any pair, so each vertex must be in its own clique.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
8 16
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: 
- For n=8 and k=16, the condition is satisfied for all pairs, so all vertices form a single clique.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4
1
1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: 
- For n=4 and k=4, the condition is satisfied for all pairs, so all vertices form a single clique.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2n
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4 5
1
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: 
- For n=5 and k=2n=10, the condition is satisfied for all pairs, so all vertices form a single clique.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 4 3
1
1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: 
- For n=4 and k=3, we can assign a_1=1, a_2=2, a_3=4, and a_4=3. The condition is satisfied for all pairs, so all vertices form a single clique.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including the smallest and largest possible values for n and k, as well as cases where the graph can be partitioned into a single clique or multiple cliques.
