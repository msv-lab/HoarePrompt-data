Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, including both Basic and Edge scenarios to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 7
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Sasha can always place bets of 1 coin if he won or 2 coins if he lost, ensuring he can reach any number of coins without exceeding 1 consecutive loss.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: Sasha can only place 1 coin initially. If he loses, he cannot place any more bets, so he cannot guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3 15
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Sasha can use a strategy to place bets in a way that he can recover from up to 3 consecutive losses and still reach any number of coins.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 6
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: With a multiplier of 3 and a loss limit of 3, Sasha cannot guarantee reaching any number of coins starting with 6 coins.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The combination of a multiplier of 4 and a loss limit of 4 does not allow Sasha to guarantee reaching any number of coins starting with 5 coins.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5 4 7
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: With a higher multiplier and the same loss limit, Sasha can use a strategy to reach any number of coins starting with 7 coins.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4 88 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: Even with a large initial amount, the combination of a multiplier of 4 and a high loss limit of 88 does not allow Sasha to guarantee reaching any number of coins.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
25 69 231
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The high multiplier and high loss limit make it impossible for Sasha to guarantee reaching any number of coins starting with 231 coins.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
13 97 18806
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The combination of a multiplier of 13 and a very high loss limit of 97 does not allow Sasha to guarantee reaching any number of coins starting with 18806 coins.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
2
2 1 1000000000
2 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
NO
```
**Explanation**: The first test case allows Sasha to reach any number of coins with a large initial amount, while the second does not due to the inability to place bets after a single loss.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
2 100 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: Even with a high loss limit, Sasha cannot place more than one bet starting with only 1 coin.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: Sasha can place 1 coin initially and 2 coins if he loses, but he cannot guarantee reaching any number of coins due to the inability to place bets after two losses.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: With a multiplier of 3 and a loss limit of 1, Sasha cannot guarantee reaching any number of coins starting with 3 coins.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2 9
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Sasha can use a strategy to place bets and recover from up to 2 consecutive losses, ensuring he can reach any number of coins starting with 9 coins.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
30 100 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: With a very high multiplier and a high loss limit, Sasha can use a strategy to reach any number of coins starting with a large initial amount.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic functionality and edge cases, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
