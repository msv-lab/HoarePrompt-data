# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- Only one disk, so reducing its radius will strictly decrease the sum of radii while maintaining tangency (though there is no tangency to maintain).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
2
0 0 1
0 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- Two disks are tangent to each other. Reducing both radii by 0.5 will maintain tangency and decrease the sum of radii.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
2
0 0 1
0 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
- Two disks are not tangent (distance between centers is 3, and sum of radii is 2). No way to adjust radii to make them tangent while reducing the sum of radii.

```
3
0 0 1
0 2 1
0 4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```

0 2 1
0 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- Two disks are tangent to each other, and the third disk is tangent to the second disk. Reducing the radii of all disks by 0.25 will maintain tangency and decrease the sum of radii.

# Test 6

0 0 1
0 2 1
0 3 1
0 5 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- Two pairs of disks are tangent to each other. Reducing the radii of all disks by 0.25 will maintain tangency and decrease the sum of radii.

0 3 1
0 5 1

YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- Three pairs of disks are tangent to each other. Reducing the radii of all disks by 0.2 will maintain tangency and decrease the sum of radii.

3
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- Two pairs of disks are tangent to each other. Reducing the radii of the first and second disks by 0.5 and the third disk by 1 will maintain tangency and decrease the sum of radii.

# Test 11

```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- Three pairs of disks are tangent to each other. Reducing the radii of the first, second, and third disks by 0.5 and the fourth disk by 1 will maintain tangency and decrease the sum of radii.

**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- Three pairs of disks are tangent to each other. Reducing the radii of the first, second, and third disks by 0.5 and the fourth disk by 1.5 will maintain tangency and decrease the sum of radii.

1000
0 0 1
1 0 1

...
999 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: 
- 1000 disks in a line, none of which are tangent to each other. No way to adjust radii to make them tangent while reducing the sum of radii.

# Test 20
**Input**: 
```
1000

2 0 1
...
998 0 1
999 0 1

```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- 999 disks in a line are not tangent to each other, but the last disk is tangent to the 999th disk. Reducing the radii of the first 999 disks by 0.5 and the last disk by 500 will maintain tangency and decrease the sum of radii.
