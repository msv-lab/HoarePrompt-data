Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 5
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: Only one number is needed, so the number itself is the output. The binary representation of 5 is 101, which has 2 ones.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 3, and 1 | 2 = 3 (binary 11) has 2 ones, which is optimal.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 5
```
**Output**: 
```
5 0
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 5, and 5 | 0 = 5 (binary 101) has 2 ones, which is optimal.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6 51
```
**Output**: 
```
3 1 1 32 2 12
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 51, and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 101111 (binary) has 5 ones, which is optimal.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 10, and the bitwise OR will have the maximum number of ones when most numbers are 1.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Only one number is needed, and 1 in binary has 1 one.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 2, and 1 | 1 = 1 (binary 1) has 1 one, which is optimal.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 0
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 1, and 1 | 0 = 1 (binary 1) has 1 one, which is optimal.

# Test 9
