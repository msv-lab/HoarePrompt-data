```
**Output**: 
```
10 1
1 5
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of {0, 0, 0, 0, 0} is 1. Setting all elements to 1 results in the array [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] with a sum of 5.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
5
0 1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
15 0
```
**Explanation**: The initial sum is already 10, and no operations are needed.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
6
0 1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
21 0
```
**Explanation**: The initial sum is already 15, and no operations are needed.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
18
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
171 1
1 18
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of 18 zeros is 1. Setting all elements to 1 results in the array [1, 1, 1, ..., 1] with a sum of 18.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
18
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17
```
**Output**: 
```
153 0
```
**Explanation**: The initial sum is already 153, and no operations are needed.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
18
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
```
**Output**: 
```
153 1
1 18
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of the array is 0. Setting all elements to 0 results in the array [0, 0, 0, ..., 0] with a sum of 0.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
18
17 17 17 17 17 17 17 17 17 17 17 17 17 17 17 17 17 17
```
**Output**: 
```
171 1
1 18
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of 18 elements all being 17 is 0. Setting all elements to 0 results in the array [0, 0, 0, ..., 0] with a sum of 0.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
3
0 0 3
```
**Output**: 
```
6 1
1 2
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of {0, 0} is 1. Setting the first two elements to 1 results in the array [1, 1, 3] with a sum of 5. The MEX of {1, 1, 3} is 0, but no further improvement is possible. However, the MEX of {1, 1} is 2, so set the first two elements to 2, resulting in [2, 2, 3] with a sum of 7.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
5
0 1 1 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
10 1
1 5
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of {0, 1, 1, 2, 2} is 3. Setting all elements to 3 results in the array [3, 3, 3, 3, 3] with a sum of 15.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
5
0 2 4 6 8
```
**Output**: 
```
15 1
1 5
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of {0, 2, 4, 6, 8} is 1. Setting all elements to 1 results in the array [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] with a sum of 5. However, the MEX of the array is 0, so set all elements to 0, resulting in the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] with a sum of 0. The MEX of the array is 1, so set all elements to 1, resulting in the array [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] with a sum of 5. However, the MEX of the array is 2, so set all elements to 2, resulting in the array [2, 2, 2, 2, 2] with a sum of 10. However, the MEX of the array is 3, so set all elements to 3, resulting in the array [3, 3, 3, 3, 3] with a sum of 15.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including arrays with all identical elements, arrays with sequential elements, and arrays with non-sequential elements. They also cover edge cases such as arrays of length 1 and arrays with the maximum length of 18.
