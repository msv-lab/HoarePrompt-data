1 3 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes the single element, making the sum 0.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 3
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes the single element, making the sum 0.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 2
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes the single element, making the sum 0.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes 2, leaving [1]. Bob cannot flip any element, resulting in a sum of 1.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2 2
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes 3 and 2, leaving [1]. Bob cannot flip any element, resulting in a sum of 1. However, Alice could remove 1 and 2, leaving [3], and Bob flips 3 to -3, resulting in a sum of -3.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
5 3 3
-1 -2 -3 -4 -5
```
**Output**: 
```
-15
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes -1, -2, -3, leaving [-4, -5]. Bob flips -4 and -5 to 4 and 5, resulting in a sum of 4 + 5 = 9. However, since all elements are negative, Alice should remove -1, -2, -3, and Bob flips -4 and -5 to 4 and 5, resulting in a sum of 4 + 5 = 9. But since Alice's goal is to maximize and Bob's is to minimize, Alice removes -1, -2, -3, and Bob flips -4 and -5 to 4 and 5, resulting in a sum of -4 - 5 = -9.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 5
-1 -2 -3 -4 -5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes all elements, resulting in a sum of 0.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
5 1 5
-1 -2 -3 -4 -5
```
**Output**: 
```
-15
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes -1, leaving [-2, -3, -4, -5]. Bob flips -2, -3, -4, -5 to 2, 3, 4, 5, resulting in a sum of 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14. However, since all elements are negative, Alice should remove -1, and Bob flips -2, -3, -4, -5 to 2, 3, 4, 5, resulting in a sum of -2 - 3 - 4 - 5 = -14. But since Alice's goal is to maximize and Bob's is to minimize, Alice removes -1, and Bob flips -2, -3, -4, -5 to 2, 3, 4, 5, resulting in a sum of -15.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2 5
-1 -2 -3 -4 -5
```
**Output**: 
```
-12
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes -1 and -2, leaving [-3, -4, -5]. Bob flips -3, -4, -5 to 3, 4, 5, resulting in a sum of 3 + 4 + 5 = 12. However, since all elements are negative, Alice should remove -1 and -2, and Bob flips -3, -4, -5 to 3, 4, 5, resulting in a sum of -3 - 4 - 5 = -12.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
5 3 5
-1 -2 -3 -4 -5
```
**Output**: 
```
-9
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes -1, -2, -3, leaving [-4, -5]. Bob flips -4 and -5 to 4 and 5, resulting in a sum of 4 + 5 = 9. However, since all elements are negative, Alice should remove -1, -2, -3, and Bob flips -4 and -5 to 4 and 5, resulting in a sum of -4 - 5 = -9.

# Test 19
**Input**: 
```
1
5 4 5
-1 -2 -3 -4 -5
```
**Output**: 
```
-6
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes -1, -2, -3, -4, leaving [-5]. Bob flips -5 to 5, resulting in a sum of 5. However, since all elements are negative, Alice should remove -1, -2, -3, -4, and Bob flips -5 to 5, resulting in a sum of -5.

# Test 20
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes all elements, resulting in a sum of 0.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases with minimal and maximal values, and various combinations of Alice's and Bob's actions.
