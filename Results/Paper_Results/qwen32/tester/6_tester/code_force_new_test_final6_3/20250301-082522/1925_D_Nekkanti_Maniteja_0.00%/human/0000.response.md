Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
4
100 0 24
2 1 10
1 2 1
3 1 2
2 1 1
5 2 4
1 2 25
3 2 24
```
**Output**: 
```
0
55
777777784
40000020
```

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Only one pair of friends, and it is chosen once. The friendship value starts at 1 and increases by 1 after being chosen, but since it's only chosen once, the total sum is 1.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 2
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The pair (1, 2) is chosen twice. Initially, the friendship value is 1. After the first choice, it becomes 2. The total sum is 1 + 2 = 3.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 3
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: There are three pairs of friends, each with an initial friendship value of 1. Each pair could be chosen once, and the total sum of their initial values is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. If each pair is chosen once, the sum is 3. If any pair is chosen more than once, the friendship value increases, but in this case, each is chosen exactly once.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3 0 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: No pairs of friends, so the friendship value for all excursions is 0.

# Test 6

8 9 1
8 10 1
9 10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
166666670
```
**Explanation**: All possible pairs are friends with an initial friendship value of 1. The expected value calculation involves the sum of the first 100000 natural numbers, adjusted for the number of pairs.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 100000
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
166666670
```
**Explanation**: The only pair (1, 2) is chosen 100000 times. The sum of the first 100000 natural numbers is used to calculate the expected value.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: No pairs of friends, so the friendship value for the single excursion is 0.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 4999950000 1
1 2 1
1 3 1
...
99999 100000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4999950000
```
**Explanation**: All possible pairs are friends with an initial friendship value of 1. The only excursion chooses one of these pairs, so the sum is the total number of pairs.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 4999950000 100000
1 2 1
1 3 1
...
99999 100000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
208332833
```
**Explanation**: All possible pairs are friends with an initial friendship value of 1. The expected value calculation involves the sum of the first 100000 natural numbers, adjusted for the number of pairs.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including no friends, all possible pairs as friends, and large numbers of children and excursions.
