```
1
2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
```
**Explanation**: The simplest case with two outcomes having the same multiplier. Betting one coin on each outcome ensures the total bet (1 + 1 = 2) is less than the winnings for each outcome.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 5 5

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3
6 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: The multipliers are such that it's impossible to distribute the coins in a way that the total bet is less than the winnings for any outcome, hence the output is -1.

**Input**: 
```
1
5
9 4 6 8 3
```
**Output**: 
```

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1
2
```

```
1
1
20
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The simplest case with only one outcome and the highest possible multiplier. Betting one coin ensures that the total bet (1) is less than the winnings (20).
