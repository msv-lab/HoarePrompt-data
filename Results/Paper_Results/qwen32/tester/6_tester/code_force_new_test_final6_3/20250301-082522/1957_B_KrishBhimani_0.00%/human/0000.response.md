```
1023 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Explanation**: The number 1023 alone sums to 1023, and adding 0s does not change the bitwise OR, which is 1023 (1111111111 in binary), having 10 ones.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1024
```
**Output**: 
```
1024 0
```
**Explanation**: The number 1024 alone sums to 1024, and adding 0 does not change the bitwise OR, which is 1024 (10000000000 in binary), having 1 one.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1023
```
**Output**: 
```
511 512
```
**Explanation**: The numbers 511 and 512 sum to 1023, and their bitwise OR (511 | 512 = 1023) has 10 ones in its binary representation, which is optimal.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 1 ... 1 1 1 (100000 ones)
```
**Explanation**: One hundred thousand 1s sum to 100000, and their bitwise OR (1 | 1 | ... | 1 = 1) has 1 one in its binary representation, which is optimal.

# Test 15

```
**Explanation**: The number 1000000000 alone sums to 1000000000, and adding 0s does not change the bitwise OR, which is 1000000000 (binary representation with 30 ones).

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 0 0 ... 0 0 0 (99999 zeros)
```
**Explanation**: The number 1 alone sums to 1, and adding 0s does not change the bitwise OR, which is 1 (1 in binary), having 1 one.
