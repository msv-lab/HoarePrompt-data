Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 2 3 4 5 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to set indices 2 to 5 to value 1, which costs 4 burles.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The array is already uniform, so no operation is needed.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
8
8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Set indices 4 to 5 to value 8, which costs 2 burles.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Single element array is already uniform.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Set either index 1 or 2 to the other value, which costs 1 burle.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Set indices 1 to 2 to value 3 or indices 2 to 3 to value 1, which costs 2 burles.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
7
4 3 2 7 1 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: Set indices 1 to 7 to any single value, which costs 7 burles, but optimal is setting indices 1 to 3 and 5 to 7 to the same value, which costs 6 burles.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
9
9 9 2 9 2 5 5 5 3
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
**Explanation**: Set indices 3 to 4 and 5 to 8 to the same value, which costs 7 burles.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
99999
```
**Explanation**: All elements are different, so setting all to the same value costs 99999 burles.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Array is already uniform.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 2 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Set indices 1 to 2 to value 1 or indices 3 to 4 to value 2, which costs 2 burles.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Set index 5 to 1, which costs 1 burle.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
5
2 2 2 2 1
```
