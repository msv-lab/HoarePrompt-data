# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10 0
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

1
1 1000000000
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The single ship is attacked 1 billion times, sinking it.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1000000000
1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The first ship is sunk after the first attack, and the second ship remains with full durability.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... 1 (100000 ones)
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks once, but no ship is sunk as each ship's durability is reduced to 0, but only one attack is made.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 100000
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... 1 (100000 ones)
```
