Sure, let's create a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem. These test cases will cover both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
3 2 7
```
**Output**: 
```
27 41 12
```
**Explanation**: This is a basic test case with three outcomes. The solution provided in the example is correct and meets the criteria.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
```
**Explanation**: This is another basic test case with two outcomes where betting 1 coin on each outcome works.

**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: In this case, all multipliers are the same, and it's impossible to distribute the coins such that the total bet is less than the return for any outcome.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6
7 9 3 17 9 13
```
**Output**: 
```
1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071
```
**Explanation**: This is a more complex test case with six outcomes, and the provided solution meets the criteria.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3
6 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case is similar to Test 3, where it's impossible to distribute the coins such that the total bet is less than the return for any outcome.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5
9 4 6 8 3
```
**Output**: 
```
8 18 12 9 24
```
**Explanation**: This is another complex test case with five outcomes, and the provided solution meets the criteria.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The simplest possible test case with one outcome. Betting 1 coin meets the criteria.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1
20
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Another simple test case with one outcome and the maximum multiplier. Betting 1 coin meets the criteria.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
2 20
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case has two outcomes with different multipliers. Betting 1 coin on each outcome works.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
50
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case has the maximum number of outcomes with the minimum multiplier. It's impossible to distribute the coins such that the total bet is less than the return for any outcome.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
50
20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This test case has the maximum number of outcomes with the maximum multiplier. It's impossible to distribute the coins such that the total bet is less than the return for any outcome.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
50
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: This test case has the maximum number of outcomes with varying multipliers. Betting 1 coin on each outcome works.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
10000
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
