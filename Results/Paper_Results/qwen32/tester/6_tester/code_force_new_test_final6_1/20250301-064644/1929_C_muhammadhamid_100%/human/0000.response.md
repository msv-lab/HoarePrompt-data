Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 7
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Sasha can place bets in such a way that he can guarantee any number of coins. If he wins, he doubles his bet; if he loses, he places the next bet with double the previous bet's amount, ensuring he can recover and continue.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: Sasha can only place a bet of 1 coin initially. If he loses, he cannot place any more bets, so he cannot guarantee any number of coins.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3 15
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Sasha can use a strategy to ensure he can recover from up to 3 consecutive losses and continue placing bets to reach any number of coins.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 6
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: Sasha cannot guarantee reaching any number of coins with the given constraints. The strategy to recover from up to 3 consecutive losses is not sufficient with the initial amount of 6 coins.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: Sasha cannot guarantee reaching any number of coins with the given constraints. The strategy to recover from up to 4 consecutive losses is not sufficient with the initial amount of 5 coins.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5 4 7
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Sasha can use a strategy to ensure he can recover from up to 4 consecutive losses and continue placing bets to reach any number of coins.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4 88 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: Even with a large initial amount, the constraint of not losing more than 88 consecutive times is too strict to guarantee reaching any number of coins.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
25 69 231
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The combination of a high multiplier and a high consecutive loss limit makes it impossible to guarantee reaching any number of coins with the initial amount of 231 coins.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
13 97 18806
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The high consecutive loss limit and the multiplier make it impossible to guarantee reaching any number of coins with the initial amount of 18806 coins.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2 100 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: With a large initial amount and a relatively low multiplier, Sasha can use a strategy to recover from up to 100 consecutive losses and continue placing bets to reach any number of coins.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
30 1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The high multiplier and the strict limit of only one consecutive loss make it impossible to guarantee reaching any number of coins with the initial amount of 1000000000 coins.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Sasha can use a strategy to ensure he can recover from up to 2 consecutive losses and continue placing bets to reach any number of coins.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
2 10 1024
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: With a large initial amount and a relatively low multiplier, Sasha can use a strategy to recover from up to 10 consecutive losses and continue placing bets to reach any number of coins.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
2 10 1023
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The initial amount is just below the threshold required to guarantee reaching any number of coins with the given constraints.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
2 10 1025
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The initial amount is just above the threshold required to guarantee reaching any number of coins with the given constraints.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the robustness, reliability, and scalability of the solution.
