Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem, including both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
24
```
**Output**: 
```
aav
```
**Description**: Basic test case with a common encoding value. The lexicographically smallest word that sums to 24 is "aav".

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
70
```
**Output**: 
```
rzz
```
**Description**: Another basic test case with a higher encoding value. The lexicographically smallest word that sums to 70 is "rzz".

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
aaa
```
**Description**: Edge case with the minimum possible encoding value. The only possible word is "aaa".

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
55
```
**Output**: 
```
czz
```
**Description**: Basic test case with a middle-range encoding value. The lexicographically smallest word that sums to 55 is "czz".

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
48
```
**Output**: 
```
auz
```
**Description**: Basic test case with an encoding value that has multiple possible words, ensuring the lexicographically smallest one is chosen.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
78
```
**Output**: 
```
zzz
```
**Description**: Edge case with the maximum possible encoding value. The only possible word is "zzz".

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
6
```
**Output**: 
```
aaa
```
**Description**: This test case checks the behavior when the encoding value is just above the minimum possible value. The lexicographically smallest word is still "aaa".

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10
```
**Output**: 
```
aaa
```
**Description**: This test case checks the behavior when the encoding value is slightly higher than the minimum possible value. The lexicographically smallest word is still "aaa".

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
26
```
**Output**: 
```
aza
```
**Description**: This test case checks the behavior when the encoding value is exactly the sum of the first and last letters of the alphabet plus 'a'. The lexicographically smallest word is "aza".

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
51
```
**Output**: 
```
bzz
```
**Description**: This test case checks the behavior with an encoding value that can be formed by starting with 'b' and filling the rest with 'z'. The lexicographically smallest word is "bzz".

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
5
3
24
78
55
48
```
**Output**: 
```
aaa
aav
zzz
czz
auz
```
**Description**: This test case includes a mix of basic and edge cases to ensure the function handles multiple test cases correctly.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
18
```
**Output**: 
```
aaa
```
**Description**: This test case checks the behavior when the encoding value is such that the only possible word is "aaa".

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
77
```
**Output**: 
```
yyz
```
**Description**: This test case checks the behavior when the encoding value is just below the maximum possible value. The lexicographically smallest word is "yyz".

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
52
```
**Output**: 
```
bzz
```
**Description**: This test case checks the behavior with an encoding value that can be formed by starting with 'b' and filling the rest with 'z'. The lexicographically smallest word is "bzz".

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
75
```
**Output**: 
```
xzz
```
**Description**: This test case checks the behavior with an encoding value that can be formed by starting with 'x' and filling the rest with 'z'. The lexicographically smallest word is "xzz".

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, ensuring that the function handles both basic and edge cases effectively.
