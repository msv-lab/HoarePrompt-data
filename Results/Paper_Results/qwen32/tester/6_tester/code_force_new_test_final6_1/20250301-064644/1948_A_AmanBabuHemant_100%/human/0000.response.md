# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
MMML
```
**Explanation**: This is a basic case where the number of special characters is 3. The string "MMML" has special characters at positions 2, 3, and 4.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
MMMML
```
**Explanation**: This is a basic case where the number of special characters is 4. The string "MMMML" has special characters at positions 2, 3, 4, and 5.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
50
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB
```
**Explanation**: This is an edge case where the number of special characters is 50, which is the maximum allowed. The string has 50 special characters, all at the end.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
200
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This is an edge case where the number of special characters exceeds the maximum possible length of the string (200).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This is an edge case where the number of special characters is 0, which is not allowed as per the problem statement (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
51
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: This is an edge case where the number of special characters exceeds the maximum allowed value (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).
