# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
3 3 3 3 3
```

```
0
```
**Explanation**: The optimal split is s=[] and t=[3,3,3,3,3]. The penalty is p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 0 = 0.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```

```
0
```
**Explanation**: The optimal split is s=[] and t=[1]. The penalty is p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 0 = 0.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The optimal split is s=[] and t=[2,1]. The penalty is p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 0 = 0.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The optimal split is s=[1] and t=[2]. The penalty is p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 0 = 0, but if we split s=[1,2] and t=[], the penalty is p(s) + p(t) = 1 + 0 = 1.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: The optimal split is s=[2,4,6,8,10] and t=[1,3,5,7,9]. The penalty is p(s) + p(t) = 4 + 4 = 8, but if we split s=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] and t=[], the penalty is p(s) + p(t) = 9 + 0 = 9.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The optimal split is s=[] and t=[10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]. The penalty is p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 0 = 0.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The optimal split is s=[] and t=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. The penalty is p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 0 = 0.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 2 3 4 5 ... 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
99999
```
**Explanation**: The optimal split is s=[2,4,6,...,100000] and t=[1,3,5,...,99999]. The penalty is p(s) + p(t) = 49999 + 49999 = 99998, but if we split s=[1,2,3,...,100000] and t=[], the penalty is p(s) + p(t) = 99999 + 0 = 99999.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
100000 99999 99998 ... 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The optimal split is s=[] and t=[100000,99999,99998,...,1]. The penalty is p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 0 = 0.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 1 1 1 1 ... 1 (100000 times)
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The optimal split is s=[] and t=[1,1,1,1,1,...,1]. The penalty is p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 0 = 0.
