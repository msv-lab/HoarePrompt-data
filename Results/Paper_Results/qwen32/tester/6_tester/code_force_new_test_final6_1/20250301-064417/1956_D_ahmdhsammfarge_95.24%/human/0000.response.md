Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios:

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
2
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4 1
1 2
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of the array [0, 1] is 2. Changing the entire array to 2 results in [2, 2] with a sum of 4.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
3
1 3 9
```
**Output**: 
```
13 0
```
**Explanation**: The initial sum of the array [1, 3, 9] is 13, which is already the maximum possible sum.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
**Explanation**: First, change the third element to 0 (MEX of [2] is 0), resulting in [1, 100, 0, 1]. Then, change the third and fourth elements to 2 (MEX of [0, 1] is 2), resulting in [1, 100, 2, 2] with a sum of 105.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 1
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of the array [0] is 1. Changing the entire array to 1 results in [1] with a sum of 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0 1
1 1
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of the array [1] is 0. Changing the entire array to 0 results in [0] with a sum of 0.
