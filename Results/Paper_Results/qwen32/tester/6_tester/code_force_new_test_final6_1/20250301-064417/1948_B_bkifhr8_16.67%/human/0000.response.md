Sure, let's create a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem. We'll start with Basic Test Cases and then move on to Edge Test Cases.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
NO
YES
```
*Explanation*: The first test case can be sorted by splitting `12` into `1` and `2`. The second test case cannot be sorted by any operation. The third test case is already sorted.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: The array is already sorted.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The array is sorted in descending order and cannot be sorted by splitting any element.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: Splitting each `10` into `1` and `0` results in `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]`, which can be rearranged to `[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]`.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2
99 10
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: Splitting `99` into `9` and `9` and `10` into `1` and `0` results in `[9, 9, 1, 0]`, which can be rearranged to `[0, 1, 9, 9]`.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
10 11
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: Splitting `10` into `1` and `0` and `11` into `1` and `1` results in `[1, 0, 1, 1]`, which can be rearranged to `[0, 1, 1, 1]`.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
10 9
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: Splitting `10` into `1` and `0` results in `[1, 0, 9]`, which cannot be rearranged to a sorted array.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 10
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: Splitting `10` into `1` and `0` results in `[0, 1, 0]`, which can be rearranged to `[0, 0, 1]`.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: Splitting `10` into `1` and `0` results in `[9, 1, 0]`, which can be rearranged to `[0, 1, 9]`.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2
100 9
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The problem specifies that elements are at most `99`, so this case is invalid. However, if we assume the input is valid and `100` were allowed, splitting `100` into `1`, `0`, and `0` results in `[1, 0, 0, 9]`, which cannot be rearranged to a sorted array without additional elements.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
2
12 34
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: Splitting `12` into `1` and `2` and `34` into `3` and `4` results in `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, which is sorted, but the original array cannot be directly sorted by splitting.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2
10 11
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: Splitting `10` into `1` and `0` and `11` into `1` and `1` results in `[1, 0, 1, 1]`, which can be rearranged to `[0, 1, 1, 1]`.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including already sorted arrays, arrays that require splitting to be sorted, and arrays that cannot be sorted by any means.
