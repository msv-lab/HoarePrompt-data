20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: This is an edge case with the maximum number of outcomes and the maximum multiplier. It's impossible to distribute the bets to satisfy the condition.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
2
2 20
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
```
**Explanation**: This is a test case with two outcomes and a large difference in multipliers. Betting 1 coin on each outcome satisfies the condition.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2
20 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
```
**Explanation**: This is a test case with two outcomes and a large difference in multipliers. Betting 1 coin on each outcome satisfies the condition.

```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
1
1
...
1
1
1
1
```
**Explanation**: This is a stress test case with the maximum number of test cases, each having one outcome. Betting 1 coin satisfies the condition for each test case.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
