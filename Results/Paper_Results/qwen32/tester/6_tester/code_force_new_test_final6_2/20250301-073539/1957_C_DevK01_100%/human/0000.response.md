**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
1 1
2 2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: After placing rooks on the diagonal, no further valid moves are possible, resulting in zero configurations.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10 5
1 2
2 1
3 3
4 5
5 4
```
**Output**: 
```
720
```
**Explanation**: With a larger board and more moves, the number of configurations increases significantly.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 0
```
**Output**: 
```
371993326789876767
```
**Explanation**: On a very large board with no moves, the number of configurations is extremely large, demonstrating the function's ability to handle large inputs.
