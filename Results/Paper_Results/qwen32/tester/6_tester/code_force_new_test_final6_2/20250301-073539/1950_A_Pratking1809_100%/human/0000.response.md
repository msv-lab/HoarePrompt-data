0 1 2
2 1 0
1 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
STAIR
NONE

```
**Explanation**: This tests the basic scenarios with smaller numbers, including zero.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
3
9 8 7
7 8 9
8 9 7
```
**Output**: 
```
NONE
STAIR
PEAK
```
**Explanation**: This tests the basic scenarios with larger numbers, including the maximum digit (9).

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
NONE
```
**Explanation**: This tests the scenario where all digits are zero.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
9 9 9
```
**Output**: 
```
NONE
```
**Explanation**: This tests the scenario where all digits are the maximum value (9).

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NONE
```
**Explanation**: This tests the scenario where two digits are the same and the third is larger, which does not form a stair.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NONE
```
**Explanation**: This tests the scenario where two digits are the same and the third is smaller, which does not form a peak.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NONE
```
**Explanation**: This tests the scenario where the middle digit is larger but the first and last digits are the same, which does not form a peak.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NONE
```
**Explanation**: This tests the scenario where all digits are the same.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
NONE
```
**Explanation**: This tests the scenario where the first and last digits are the same and the middle digit is larger, which does not form a stair.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
9 8 9
```
**Output**: 
```
NONE
```
**Explanation**: This tests the scenario where the first and last digits are the same and the middle digit is smaller, which does not form a peak.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NONE
```
**Explanation**: This tests the scenario where the first digit is smaller and the last two digits are the same, which does not form a stair.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NONE
```
**Explanation**: This tests the scenario where the first two digits are the same and the last digit is smaller, which does not form a peak.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
1 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
PEAK
```
**Explanation**: This tests the scenario where the middle digit is the largest, forming a peak.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
2 4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
PEAK
```
**Explanation**: This tests the scenario where the middle digit is the largest, forming a peak.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
3 5 4
```
**Output**: 
```
PEAK
```
**Explanation**: This tests the scenario where the middle digit is the largest, forming a peak.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
4 6 5
```
**Output**: 
```
PEAK
```
**Explanation**: This tests the scenario where the middle digit is the largest, forming a peak.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
5 7 6
```
**Output**: 
```
PEAK
```
**Explanation**: This tests the scenario where the middle digit is the largest, forming a peak.

# Test 19
**Input**: 
```
1
6 8 7
```
**Output**: 
```
PEAK
```
**Explanation**: This tests the scenario where the middle digit is the largest, forming a peak.

# Test 20
**Input**: 
```
1
7 9 8
```
**Output**: 
```
PEAK
```
**Explanation**: This tests the scenario where the middle digit is the largest, forming a peak.

### Large Input Test Case

# Test 21
**Input**: 
```
1000
1 2 3
3 2 1
1 5 3
3 4 1
0 0 0
4 1 7
4 5 7
...
(repeat the above patterns in a random order)
```
**Output**: 
```
STAIR
NONE
PEAK
PEAK
NONE
NONE
STAIR
...
```
**Explanation**: This tests the scalability of the code by running a large number of test cases. The output should match the expected results for each pattern.

These test cases should cover a wide range of scenarios and help ensure the robustness and reliability of the solution.
