```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 1 1
```

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
7 3
1 1 1 2
1 2 1 2
2 1 1 2
```
**Explanation**: For n=2, the maximum sum is 7. This is achieved by setting the first row to [1, 2], the second row to [1, 2], and the first column to [1, 2].

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
18 6
1 1 1 2 3
1 2 1 2 3

2 1 1 2 3
2 2 1 2 3
2 3 1 2 3
```
**Explanation**: For n=3, the maximum sum is 18. This is achieved by setting each row and each column to the permutation [1, 2, 3].

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
4
```
**Output**: 
```
40 8
1 1 1 2 3 4
1 2 1 2 3 4

1 4 1 2 3 4
2 1 1 2 3 4
2 2 1 2 3 4
2 3 1 2 3 4
2 4 1 2 3 4
```
**Explanation**: For n=4, the maximum sum is 40. This is achieved by setting each row and each column to the permutation [1, 2, 3, 4].

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 1 1
7 3
1 1 1 2
1 2 1 2
2 1 1 2
```
**Explanation**: Multiple test cases in a single input. The first test case is for n=1 and the second for n=2. The outputs are the same as Test 1 and Test 2 respectively.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
500
```
**Output**: 
```
125250 1000
1 1 1 2 3 ... 500
1 2 1 2 3 ... 500
...
1 500 1 2 3 ... 500
2 1 1 2 3 ... 500
2 2 1 2 3 ... 500
...
2 500 1 2 3 ... 500
```
**Explanation**: For the maximum n=500, the maximum sum is 125250. This is achieved by setting each row and each column to the permutation [1, 2, ..., 500]. The output is truncated for brevity.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
250
```
**Output**: 
```
31250 500
1 1 1 2 3 ... 250
1 2 1 2 3 ... 250
...
1 250 1 2 3 ... 250
2 1 1 2 3 ... 250
2 2 1 2 3 ... 250
...
2 250 1 2 3 ... 250
```
**Explanation**: For n=250, the maximum sum is 31250. This is achieved by setting each row and each column to the permutation [1, 2, ..., 250]. The output is truncated for brevity.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
7 3
1 1 1 2
1 2 1 2
2 1 1 2
```

1 2 1 2 3
1 3 1 2 3
2 1 1 2 3
2 2 1 2 3
2 3 1 2 3
```
**Explanation**: Another test case for n=3 to ensure consistency and correctness of the implementation.
