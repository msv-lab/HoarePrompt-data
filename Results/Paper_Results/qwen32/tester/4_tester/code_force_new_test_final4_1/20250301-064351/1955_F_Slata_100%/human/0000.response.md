# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
# Explanation: Initial sequence is [1, 2, 3], XOR is 1 ^ 2 ^ 3 = 0, so Bob wins. Removing any number will make XOR non-zero, so Alice wins the rest.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
# Explanation: Initial sequence is [1, 3, 2, 2, 4], XOR is 1 ^ 3 ^ 2 ^ 2 ^ 4 = 0, so Bob wins. Removing 1 and 3 will make XOR non-zero, so Alice wins the rest.

```
**Output**: 
```
3
```

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```

```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
# Explanation: Initial sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4], XOR is 1 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 4 = 4, so Alice wins. Removing any number will make XOR non-zero, so Alice wins the rest.
