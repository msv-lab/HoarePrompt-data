Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3 1
2 3
3 1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: 
- The tree is a simple line with nodes 1, 2, and 3. Starting at node 3, Ron moves the stone to node 2, and Hermione moves it to node 1. Ron cannot move, so Hermione wins. However, since Ron starts and can make the first move, he wins in this scenario.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
5 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: 
- The tree is a line with nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Starting at node 5, Ron moves the stone to node 4, Hermione to node 3, Ron to node 2, and Hermione to node 1. Ron cannot move, so Hermione wins.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
4 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: 
- The tree is a line with nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. Starting at node 1, Ron moves the stone to node 2, Hermione to node 3, and Ron to node 4. Hermione cannot move, so Ron wins. However, since Hermione starts the last move, she wins in this scenario.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
2 1
1 2
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: 
- The tree is a simple line with nodes 1 and 2. Starting at node 1, Ron moves the stone to node 2. Hermione cannot move, so Ron wins.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2 1
1 2
2
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: 
- The tree is a simple line with nodes 1 and 2. Starting at node 2, Ron moves the stone to node 1. Hermione cannot move, so Ron wins.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
10 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
6 7
7 8
8 9
9 10
10
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: 
- The tree is a line with nodes 1 to 10. Starting at node 10, Ron and Hermione alternate moves until Hermione moves the stone to node 1, and Ron cannot move, so Hermione wins.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
10 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
6 7
7 8
8 9
9 10
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: 
- The tree is a line with nodes 1 to 10. Starting at node 1, Ron and Hermione alternate moves until Hermione moves the stone to node 10, and Ron cannot move, so Hermione wins.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
200000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
199999 200000
200000
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: 
- The tree is a line with nodes 1 to 200000. Starting at node 200000, Ron and Hermione alternate moves until Hermione moves the stone to node 1, and Ron cannot move, so Hermione wins.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
200000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
199999 200000
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: 
- The tree is a line with nodes 1 to 200000. Starting at node 1, Ron and Hermione alternate moves until Hermione moves the stone to node 200000, and Ron cannot move, so Hermione wins.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including the smallest possible tree, larger trees, and the maximum possible input size, ensuring the solution is robust and handles edge cases correctly.
