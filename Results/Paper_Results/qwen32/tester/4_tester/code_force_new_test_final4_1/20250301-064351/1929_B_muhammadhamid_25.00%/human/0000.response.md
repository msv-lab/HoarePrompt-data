Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The smallest grid where we need to color 2 cells to ensure 4 diagonals have at least one colored cell.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Similar to Test 1, but ensuring that 3 diagonals have at least one colored cell is still achieved with 2 cells.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 10
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: In a 3x3 grid, there are 4 main diagonals (2 primary and 2 secondary) and 6 off-diagonals. To cover 10 diagonals, 6 cells are needed.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 9
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: To cover 9 diagonals in a 3x3 grid, 5 cells are required.

6
```
**Explanation**: In a 7x7 grid, 11 diagonals can be covered with 6 cells.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: In a 2x2 grid, 3 diagonals can be covered with 2 cells.

# Test 8

```
1
```
**Explanation**: In a 2x2 grid, 2 diagonals can be covered with 1 cell.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 400000000
```

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Even in a very large grid, covering just 1 diagonal requires only 1 cell.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: In a 10x10 grid, 4 diagonals can be covered with 2 cells.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10 36
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: In a 10x10 grid, 36 diagonals can be covered with 10 cells.
