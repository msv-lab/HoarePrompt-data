1
100000 100000
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... 1 (100000 times)
```
**Output**: 
```
100000
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks each ship exactly once, sinking all of them.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 1000000000000000
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... 1 (100000 times)
```
**Output**: 
```
100000
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks each ship multiple times, but all ships are sunk after 100000 attacks.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 1000000000000000
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 ... 1000000000 (100000 times)
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks each ship, but none of them sink due to their high durability.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1000000000000000
1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks the first ship until it sinks, then attacks the second ship but does not sink it.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1000000000000000
1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks the second ship until it sinks, then attacks the first ship but does not sink it.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1000000000000000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: The Kraken attacks the ships until all of them are sunk.
