```
1
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Similar to Test 1, two cells on opposite diagonals can cover 3 diagonals.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 10
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: All 10 diagonals need to be covered. The optimal way is to color cells such that each diagonal has at least one colored cell.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 9
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: Covering 9 diagonals requires coloring 5 cells optimally.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
7 11
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: For a 7x7 grid, 11 diagonals can be covered with 6 cells.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: For a 2x2 grid, all 3 diagonals can be covered with 2 cells.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: For a 2x2 grid, 2 diagonals can be covered with 1 cell.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: For a 2x2 grid, 1 diagonal can be covered with 1 cell.

# Test 10

```
1
100000000 400000000
```
**Output**: 
```
100000000
```
**Explanation**: For a very large grid, covering a large number of diagonals requires coloring cells along the main diagonal.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: For a very large grid, covering just 2 diagonals can be done with a single cell.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 400000001
```
**Output**: 
```
100000000
```
**Explanation**: For a very large grid, covering almost all diagonals requires coloring cells along the main diagonal.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
5 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: For a 5x5 grid, covering just 1 diagonal can be done with a single cell.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
5 25
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: For a 5x5 grid, covering all 25 diagonals requires coloring cells along the main diagonal.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
5 10
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: For a 5x5 grid, covering 10 diagonals requires coloring cells along the main diagonal.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: For a 10x10 grid, covering just 1 diagonal can be done with a single cell.

```
1
10 38
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: For a 10x10 grid, covering 38 diagonals requires coloring cells along the main diagonal.

**Input**: 
```
1
10 40
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: For a 10x10 grid, covering all 40 diagonals requires coloring cells along the main diagonal.

# Test 19
**Input**: 
```
1
10 39
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: For a 10x10 grid, covering 39 diagonals requires coloring cells along the main diagonal.
