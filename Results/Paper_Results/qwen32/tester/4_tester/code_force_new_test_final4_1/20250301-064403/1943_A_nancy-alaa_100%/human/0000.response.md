Certainly! Below are a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem, including both basic and edge scenarios. Each test case is well-documented to explain the scenario it covers.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Alice can maximize the MEX by picking elements optimally, leading to a final array `c` with MEX 2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The array is already sorted, and Bob can minimize the MEX by picking elements optimally, leading to a final array `c` with MEX 1.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice cannot add 0 to `c` as it is not in the array, and Bob can prevent Alice from doing so, leading to a final array `c` with MEX 0.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice picks the only element, and the final array `c` is `[0]`, which has a MEX of 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice picks the only element, and the final array `c` is `[1]`, which has a MEX of 0.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice can only add 0 to `c`, and Bob can prevent any other number from being added, leading to a final array `c` with MEX 1.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Bob can minimize the MEX by picking elements optimally, leading to a final array `c` with MEX 2.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
6
0 1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Bob can minimize the MEX by picking elements optimally, leading to a final array `c` with MEX 3.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
6
5 5 5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice can only add 5 to `c`, and Bob can prevent any other number from being added, leading to a final array `c` with MEX 1.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
2
3
0 0 1
3
2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1
```
**Explanation**: For the first test case, Alice can maximize the MEX to 2. For the second test case, Alice can only add 2 to `c`, and Bob can prevent any other number from being added, leading to a final array `c` with MEX 1.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: Bob can minimize the MEX by picking elements optimally, leading to a final array `c` with MEX 5.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10
9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice can only add 9 to `c`, and Bob can prevent any other number from being added, leading to a final array `c` with MEX 1.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
7
0 1 2 3 4 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Bob can minimize the MEX by picking elements optimally, leading to a final array `c` with MEX 3.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
8
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: Bob can minimize the MEX by picking elements optimally, leading to a final array `c` with MEX 4.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
8
7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice can only add 7 to `c`, and Bob can prevent any other number from being added, leading to a final array `c` with MEX 1.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic cases, edge cases, and large input sizes to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.
