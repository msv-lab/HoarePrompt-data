Sure, let's create a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3
0 0 1
2 0 1
4 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The disks are tangent to each other. We can decrease the radii of all disks by a small amount while maintaining tangency.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
2
0 0 1
0 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The disks are tangent to each other. We can decrease the radii of both disks by a small amount while maintaining tangency.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: There is only one disk. We can decrease its radius by any positive amount.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
2
0 0 2
4 0 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The disks are not tangent and do not overlap. There is no way to decrease the sum of radii while maintaining the conditions.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2
0 0 1000000000
0 2 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The disks are tangent to each other with very large radii. We can decrease the radii by a small amount while maintaining tangency.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
3
-1000000000 -1000000000 1
-1000000000 1000000000 1
1000000000 -1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The disks are tangent to each other and far apart. We can decrease the radii of all disks by a small amount while maintaining tangency.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
2
-1000000000 -1000000000 1000000000
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The disks are not tangent and do not overlap. There is no way to decrease the sum of radii while maintaining the conditions.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
2
0 0 1
0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The disks are not tangent and do not overlap. There is no way to decrease the sum of radii while maintaining the conditions.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
3
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The disks are tangent to each other in a line. We can decrease the radii of all disks by a small amount while maintaining tangency.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
3
0 0 1
1 0 2
3 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The disks are not tangent and do not overlap. There is no way to decrease the sum of radii while maintaining the conditions.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1000
0 0 1
1 0 1

```
**Explanation**: The disks are tangent to each other in a line. We can decrease the radii of all disks by a small amount while maintaining tangency. This tests scalability with the maximum number of disks.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
4
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
3 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The disks are tangent to each other in a line. We can decrease the radii of all disks by a small amount while maintaining tangency.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
4
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
3 0 2
```
**Output**: 
```
