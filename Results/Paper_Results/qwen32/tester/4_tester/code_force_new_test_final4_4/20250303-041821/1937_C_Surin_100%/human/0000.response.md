```
? 0 1 2 3
? 0 2 3 4
? 0 3 4 1
? 0 4 1 2
? 1 2 3 4
? 1 3 4 0
? 1 4 0 2
? 2 3 4 0
? 2 4 0 1
? 3 4 0 1
! 4 0
```
**Explanation**: This is a test case with n=5. The queries are designed to cover all possible pairs and find the maximum XOR.

### Edge Test Cases

? 0 3 6 7
? 0 4 8 9
? 1 2 4 5
? 1 3 6 7
? 1 4 8 9
? 2 3 6 7
? 2 4 8 9
? 3 4 6 7
? 3 5 8 9
? 4 5 6 7
? 4 6 8 9
? 5 6 7 8
? 5 7 8 9
? 6 7 8 9
! 6 9
```
**Explanation**: This is a test case with n=10. The queries are designed to cover all possible pairs and find the maximum XOR efficiently.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
? 0 1 0 1
! 0 1
```
**Explanation**: This is a test case with the minimum possible n=2. The query is designed to directly compare the two elements.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10000
```
**Output**: 
```
? 0 1 2 3
? 0 2 4 5
? 0 3 6 7
...
! 9998 9999
```
**Explanation**: This is a test case with the maximum possible n=10000. The queries are designed to cover all possible pairs and find the maximum XOR within the limit of 3n queries.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4
```
**Output**: 
```
? 0 1 2 3
? 0 2 1 3
? 0 3 1 2
? 1 2 3 0
? 1 3 2 0
? 2 3 0 1
! 0 3
```
**Explanation**: This is a test case with n=4. The queries are designed to cover all possible pairs and find the maximum XOR.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
5000
```
**Output**: 
```
? 0 1 2 3
? 0 2 4 5
? 0 3 6 7
...
! 4998 4999
```
**Explanation**: This is a test case with n=5000. The queries are designed to cover all possible pairs and find the maximum XOR within the limit of 3n queries.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic functionality and edge cases, ensuring the solution is robust, reliable, and scalable.
