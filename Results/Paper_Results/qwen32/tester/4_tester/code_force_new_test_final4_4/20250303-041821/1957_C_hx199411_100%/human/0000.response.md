# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With a 1x1 board and no initial moves, only one configuration is possible, which is placing a rook in the only available cell.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: With a 2x2 board and no initial moves, there are two possible configurations: placing rooks in (1,1) and (2,2) or (1,2) and (2,1).

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3 0
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: With a 3x3 board and no initial moves, there are six possible configurations, as each rook placement leads to a unique configuration.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: With the initial move placing a rook at (1,1), the computer skips its turn. The remaining configurations involve placing rooks in the remaining cells.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
1 2
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With both rooks placed symmetrically, there is only one possible configuration left, which is placing rooks in the remaining diagonal cells (3,3) and (4,4).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2
1 2
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
12
```
**Explanation**: Similar to Test 8, but with a larger board, leading to more possible configurations.

**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
1 1
2 2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: With all cells occupied by rooks, no further moves are possible, resulting in zero configurations.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
1 2
2 1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: With all cells occupied by rooks, no further moves are possible, resulting in zero configurations.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: With all cells occupied by rooks, no further moves are possible, resulting in zero configurations.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
4 3
1 2
2 1
3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: With three rooks placed, there are two possible configurations left for the remaining rook.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
5 4
1 2
2 1
3 4
4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: With four rooks placed, there are six possible configurations left for the remaining rook.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
1000 0
```
**Output**: 
```
998001000
```
**Explanation**: With a large board and no initial moves, the number of configurations is large, and the output is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
300000 0
```
**Output**: 
```
900010000
```
**Explanation**: With the maximum board size and no initial moves, the number of configurations is very large, and the output is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
300000 299999
1 2
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
299998
```
**Explanation**: With almost all cells occupied, there are only a few configurations left, and the output is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

# Test 18
