# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Comments**: The sequence contains only one '4', so the XOR is non-zero, and Alice wins.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Comments**: The sequence contains two '1's, so the XOR is zero, and Bob wins.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
0 2 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Comments**: The sequence contains two '2's, so the XOR is zero, and Bob wins.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Comments**: The sequence contains two '3's, so the XOR is zero, and Bob wins.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 0 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Comments**: The sequence contains two '4's, so the XOR is zero, and Bob wins.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Comments**: The sequence contains one '1' and one '2', so the XOR is non-zero, and Alice wins.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Comments**: The sequence contains one '2' and one '3', so the XOR is non-zero, and Alice wins.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Comments**: The sequence contains one '3' and one '4', so the XOR is non-zero, and Alice wins.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
4 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Comments**: The sequence contains four '1's, so the XOR is zero after removing two '1's, and Bob wins twice.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
0 4 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Comments**: The sequence contains four '2's, so the XOR is zero after removing two '2's, and Bob wins twice.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 4 0
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Comments**: The sequence contains four '3's, so the XOR is zero after removing two '3's, and Bob wins twice.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 0 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Comments**: The sequence contains four '4's, so the XOR is zero after removing two '4's, and Bob wins twice.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Comments**: The sequence contains one of each number, so the XOR is zero, and Bob wins once.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
200 200 200 200
```
**Output**: 
```
300
```
**Comments**: The sequence contains 200 of each number, so the XOR is zero after removing 300 numbers, and Bob wins 300 times.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Comments**: The sequence contains different counts of each number, so the XOR is zero after optimal removals, and Bob wins twice.

# Test 19
**Input**: 
```
1
100 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
50
```
**Comments**: The sequence contains 100 '1's, so the XOR is zero after removing 50 '1's, and Bob wins 50 times.

# Test 20
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 0 100
```
**Output**: 
```
50
```
**Comments**: The sequence contains 100 '4's, so the XOR is zero after removing 50 '4's, and Bob wins 50 times.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases, to ensure the solution is robust and handles all possible inputs correctly.
