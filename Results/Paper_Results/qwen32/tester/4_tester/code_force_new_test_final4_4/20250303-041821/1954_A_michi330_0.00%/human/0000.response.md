# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```

```
1
5 1 1
```

```
NO
```
**Explanation**: With only one color, no matter how Alice paints the ribbon, Bob can repaint any part to make all parts the same color.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: With only two colors, Bob can always repaint two parts to make all parts the same color.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Alice can use all five colors (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), making it impossible for Bob to repaint just three parts to make all parts the same color.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Alice can paint the ribbon with alternating colors (e.g., [1, 2, 1]), making it impossible for Bob to repaint just one part to make all parts the same color.

# Test 7

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Alice can use three colors in a pattern (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 1]), making it impossible for Bob to repaint just two parts to make all parts the same color.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Alice can use all four colors (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4]), making it impossible for Bob to repaint just two parts to make all parts the same color.

# Test 10

```
1
5 5 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Alice can use all five colors (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), making it impossible for Bob to repaint just two parts to make all parts the same color.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
50 50 49
