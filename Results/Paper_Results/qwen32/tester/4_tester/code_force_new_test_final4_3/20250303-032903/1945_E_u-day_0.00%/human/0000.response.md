**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1 3
2 3
```
**Explanation**: Swapping elements at positions 1 and 3, then 2 and 3, results in [1, 2, 3], and binary search will find 2.

# Test 6 (Edge Case: Single Element)
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: With only one element, no swaps are needed.

# Test 7 (Edge Case: x is the smallest element)
**Input**: 
```
1
5 1
5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1 5
2 5
```
**Explanation**: Swapping elements at positions 1 and 5, then 2 and 5, results in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and binary search will find 1.

# Test 8 (Edge Case: x is the largest element)
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The permutation is already sorted, and the element 5 is at the correct position.

# Test 9 (Edge Case: x is not initially in the correct position)
**Input**: 
```
1
5 4
1 2 3 5 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1
4 5
```
**Explanation**: Swapping elements at positions 4 and 5 results in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and binary search will find 4.

# Test 10 (Edge Case: x is in the middle, but needs to be moved)
**Input**: 
```
1
5 3
1 5 2 4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Explanation**: Swapping elements at positions 2 and 3 results in [1, 2, 5, 4, 3], and binary search will find 3.

# Test 11 (Edge Case: Large Input Size)
**Input**: 
```
1
200000 100000
200000 199999 ... 100001 100000 99999 ... 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1 100000
100001 200000
```
**Explanation**: Swapping elements at positions 1 and 100000, then 100001 and 200000, results in a sorted permutation, and binary search will find 100000.

# Test 12 (Edge Case: x is repeated in the permutation)
**Input**: 
```
1
5 3
3 3 3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Although the problem states that the input is a permutation, this test case checks the behavior if the input were not a permutation. However, since the problem guarantees a permutation, this case is not strictly valid but included for completeness.

# Test 13 (Edge Case: x is at the end initially)
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The permutation is already sorted, and the element 5 is at the correct position.

# Test 14 (Edge Case: x is at the beginning initially)
**Input**: 
```
1
5 1
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The permutation is already sorted, and the element 1 is at the correct position.

# Test 15 (Edge Case: x is the second element)
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2
5 2 3 4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1 2
```
**Explanation**: Swapping elements at positions 1 and 2 results in [2, 5, 3, 4, 1], and binary search will find 2.

# Test 16 (Edge Case: x is the second last element)
**Input**: 
```
1
5 4
5 1 2 4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
4 5
```
**Explanation**: Swapping elements at positions 4 and 5 results in [5, 1, 2, 3, 4], and binary search will find 4.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the robustness, reliability, and scalability of the solution.
