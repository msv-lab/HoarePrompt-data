Certainly! Below are the comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3 1
2 3
3 1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a simple triangle. Starting at node 3, Ron can move to node 1 or node 2. If he moves to node 1, Hermione will move to node 2, and Ron will have no move left, making Hermione the winner. If Ron moves to node 2, Hermione will move to node 1, and Ron will have no move left, making Hermione the winner. However, Ron can force a win by moving to node 2 first, leaving Hermione with no optimal move.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
5 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a straight line. Starting at node 5, Ron can only move to node 4. Hermione then moves to node 3, Ron to node 2, and Hermione to node 1, leaving Ron with no move left.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
4 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a straight line. Starting at node 4, Ron can only move to node 3. Hermione then moves to node 2, Ron to node 1, and Hermione has no move left, making Ron the winner. However, starting from node 4, Hermione can force a win by moving to node 3, leaving Ron with no optimal move.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
2 1
1 2
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is the simplest possible, with only two nodes. Starting at node 1, Ron can move to node 2, leaving Hermione with no move left.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2 1
1 2
2
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is the simplest possible, with only two nodes. Starting at node 2, Ron can move to node 1, leaving Hermione with no move left. However, since Ron makes the first move, he wins in this scenario.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
100000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
99999 100000
100000
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a straight line with 100,000 nodes. Starting at node 100,000, Ron will make moves to node 99,999, Hermione to node 99,998, and so on. Since the number of nodes is even, Hermione will make the last move, winning the game.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
100000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
99999 100000
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a straight line with 100,000 nodes. Starting at node 1, Ron will make moves to node 2, Hermione to node 3, and so on. Since the number of nodes is even, Ron will make the last move, winning the game.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
5 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a straight line. Starting at node 1, Ron can only move to node 2. Hermione then moves to node 3, Ron to node 4, and Hermione to node 5, leaving Ron with no move left.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
5 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
2
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a straight line. Starting at node 2, Ron can only move to node 1 or node 3. If he moves to node 1, Hermione will move to node 3, Ron to node 4, and Hermione to node 5, leaving Ron with no move left. If Ron moves to node 3, Hermione will move to node 1, Ron to node 4, and Hermione to node 5, leaving Ron with no move left.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
5 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
4
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a straight line. Starting at node 4, Ron can only move to node 3 or node 5. If he moves to node 3, Hermione will move to node 1, Ron to node 2, and Hermione to node 5, leaving Ron with no move left. If Ron moves to node 5, Hermione will move to node 3, Ron to node 1, and Hermione to node 2, leaving Ron with no move left.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including the smallest possible tree, the largest possible tree, and various starting positions. They ensure that the solution handles both basic and edge cases effectively.
