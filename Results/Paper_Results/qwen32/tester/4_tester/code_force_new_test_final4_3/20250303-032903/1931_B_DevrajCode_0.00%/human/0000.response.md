Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
43
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Only one container, so it's trivially possible to have the same amount of water in all containers.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 4, which can be evenly divided by 2, but the operation constraint (pouring from i to j where i < j) makes it impossible to equalize the water.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
4 5 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 15, which can be evenly divided by 5. It's possible to redistribute the water to make each container have 3 units.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 6, which can be evenly divided by 3. However, the operation constraint prevents equalizing the water.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
7
4 5 5 0 6 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 28, which can be evenly divided by 7. However, the operation constraint prevents equalizing the water.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
7
6 5 5 1 3 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 28, which can be evenly divided by 7. It's possible to redistribute the water to make each container have 4 units.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Both containers are already empty, so they trivially have the same amount of water.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 2,000,000,000, which can be evenly divided by 2. It's trivial to equalize the water.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 1 1 ... 1 (100000 times)
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers already have the same amount of water (1 unit), so no operations are needed.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
0 0 0 ... 0 (100000 times)
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers are empty, so they trivially have the same amount of water.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1000000000 0
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 1,000,000,000, which can be evenly divided by 2, but the operation constraint prevents equalizing the water.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1000000000 1000000000 0
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum is 2,000,000,000, which can be evenly divided by 3, but the operation constraint prevents equalizing the water.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
10000
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
YES
YES
...
YES (10000 times)
```
**Explanation**: Each test case has only one container with 1 unit of water, so it's trivially possible to have the same amount of water in all containers.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
10000
2
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
YES
YES
...
YES (10000 times)
```
**Explanation**: Each test case has two containers, both empty, so they trivially have the same amount of water.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
10000
2
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
YES
YES
...
YES (10000 times)
```
**Explanation**: Each test case has two containers, each with 1,000,000,000 units of water, so it's trivially possible to have the same amount of water in all containers.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases, and scalability considerations.
