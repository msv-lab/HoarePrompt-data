Sure, let's create a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
6 7 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The fireworks from the first installation are visible at times [6, 12, 18, ...] and from the second installation at [7, 14, 21, ...]. The maximum overlap is at time 7 and 12, where one firework from each installation is visible.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 4 10
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
**Explanation**: The fireworks from the first installation are visible at times [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, ...] and from the second installation at [4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, ...]. The maximum overlap is at time 12, where 7 fireworks are visible.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
7 8 56
```
**Output**: 
```
17
```
**Explanation**: The fireworks from the first installation are visible at times [7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112, ...] and from the second installation at [8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112, ...]. The maximum overlap is at time 56 and 112, where 17 fireworks are visible.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 6 78123459896
```
**Output**: 
```
28645268630
```
**Explanation**: Large values for `a`, `b`, and `m` are given. The maximum overlap occurs at the least common multiple of `a` and `b` within the visibility period.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: Both installations launch fireworks every minute, and each firework is visible for 2 minutes. The maximum overlap is at every minute, where 4 fireworks are visible.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
2000000000000000002
```
**Explanation**: Both installations launch fireworks every minute, and each firework is visible for a very long time. The maximum overlap is at every minute, where a very large number of fireworks are visible.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10 15 99
```
**Output**: 
```
14
```
**Explanation**: The least common multiple of 10 and 15 is 30. The fireworks from the first installation are visible at times [10, 20, 30, ...] and from the second installation at [15, 30, 45, ...]. The maximum overlap is at time 30, where 14 fireworks are visible.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000 1000000000000000000 1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Both installations launch fireworks at the same time, and each firework is visible for a very long time. The maximum overlap is at the launch time, where 3 fireworks are visible.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2 1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000000000002
```
**Explanation**: The first installation launches fireworks every minute, and the second installation launches fireworks every 2 minutes. The maximum overlap occurs at every minute, where a very large number of fireworks are visible.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
999999999999999999 1000000000000000000 1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
2000000000000000001
```
**Explanation**: Large values for `a` and `b` are given, and the least common multiple is very large. The maximum overlap occurs at the least common multiple within the visibility period.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases with large numbers, and cases with small numbers to ensure the robustness and reliability of the solution.
