Sure, let's create a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem. We will cover basic scenarios and edge cases to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: As described in the problem statement, after the initial moves, there are three possible configurations.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 0
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: With a 3x3 board and no initial moves, there are 6 possible configurations (3 positions for the first white rook and 2 positions for the black rook).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With a 2x2 board and the first move being (1,1), the only possible configuration is when both rooks are placed at (1,1) and (1,1), but since the computer skips its turn, the only configuration is just the initial move.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With a 1x1 board and no initial moves, the only possible configuration is placing the white rook at (1,1).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: With a 1x1 board and the first move being (1,1), there are no more valid moves, so the number of final configurations is 0.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
1 2
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: With a 3x3 board and the initial moves being (1,2) and (2,3), there are no more valid moves, so the number of final configurations is 0.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1000 0
```
**Output**: 
```
500500
```
**Explanation**: With a 1000x1000 board and no initial moves, the number of configurations is calculated based on the number of ways to place the first white rook and the subsequent black rook.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1000 499
499 500
498 501
...
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With a 1000x1000 board and 499 initial moves, the board is almost full, leaving only one possible configuration.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
1 2
2 3
3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: With a 3x3 board and the initial moves being (1,2), (2,3), and (3,1), there are no more valid moves, so the number of final configurations is 0.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 0
```
**Output**: 
```
4999950000
```
**Explanation**: With a 100000x100000 board and no initial moves, the number of configurations is calculated based on the number of ways to place the first white rook and the subsequent black rook, modulo 10^9+7.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 49999
49999 50000
49998 50001
...
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With a 100000x100000 board and 49999 initial moves, the board is almost full, leaving only one possible configuration.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
100000 50000
1 2
2 3
...
50000 50001
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: With a 100000x100000 board and 50000 initial moves, the board is full, leaving no more valid moves, so the number of final configurations is 0.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases with small and large board sizes, and scenarios with no initial moves, fully filled boards, and almost filled boards.
