Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, including both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2 1
1
1 1
```
**Explanation**: 
- With `n=2` and `k=3`, all pairs of vertices can form an edge since `|1-2| + |2-1| = 2 <= 3`. Thus, the entire graph is a single clique.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2 1
2
1 2
```
**Explanation**: 
- With `n=2` and `k=1`, vertices 1 and 2 cannot form an edge since `|1-2| + |2-1| = 2 > 1`. Thus, each vertex forms its own clique.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3
1
1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: 
- With `n=3` and `k=3`, all pairs of vertices can form an edge since `|i-j| + |a_i-a_j| <= 3` for all pairs. Thus, the entire graph is a single clique.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3
2
1 1 2
```
**Explanation**: 
- With `n=3` and `k=2`, vertices (1,2) and (2,3) form edges but (1,3) does not since `|1-3| + |1-3| = 4 > 2`. Thus, we have two cliques: {1,2} and {3}.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4
1
1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: 
- With `n=4` and `k=4`, all pairs of vertices can form an edge since `|i-j| + |a_i-a_j| <= 4` for all pairs. Thus, the entire graph is a single clique.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4
2
1 1 2 2
```
**Explanation**: 
- With `n=4` and `k=3`, vertices (1,2), (2,3), and (3,4) form edges but (1,3) and (2,4) do not since `|1-3| + |1-3| = 4 > 3` and `|2-4| + |2-4| = 4 > 3`. Thus, we have two cliques: {1,2} and {3,4}.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4 5
1
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: 
- With `n=5` and `k=5`, all pairs of vertices can form an edge since `|i-j| + |a_i-a_j| <= 5` for all pairs. Thus, the entire graph is a single clique.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
5 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4 5
2
1 1 2 2 2
```
**Explanation**: 
- With `n=5` and `k=4`, vertices (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), and (4,5) form edges but (1,3), (2,4), and (3,5) do not since `|1-3| + |1-3| = 4`, `|2-4| + |2-4| = 4`, and `|3-5| + |3-5| = 4`. Thus, we have two cliques: {1,2} and {3,4,5}.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4 5
1
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: 
- With `n=5` and `k=6`, all pairs of vertices can form an edge since `|i-j| + |a_i-a_j| <= 6` for all pairs. Thus, the entire graph is a single clique.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
8 16
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: 
- With `n=8` and `k=16`, all pairs of vertices can form an edge since `|i-j| + |a_i-a_j| <= 16` for all pairs. Thus, the entire graph is a single clique.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
8 15
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
2
1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2
```
**Explanation**: 
- With `n=8` and `k=15`, vertices (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (5,6), (6,7), and (7,8) form edges but (1,5), (2,6), (3,7), and (4,8) do not since `|1-5| + |1-5| = 8`, `|2-6| + |2-6| = 8`, `|3-7| + |3-7| = 8`, and `|4-8| + |4-8| = 8`. Thus, we have two cliques: {1,2,3,4} and {5,6,7,8}.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
8 14
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
3
1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3
```
**Explanation**: 
- With `n=8` and `k=14`, vertices (1,2), (2,3), (4,5), (5,6), and (7,8) form edges but (1,4), (2,5), (3,6), and (4,7) do not since `|1-4| + |1-4| = 6`, `|2-5| + |2-5| = 6`, `|3-6| + |3-6| = 6`, and `|4-7| + |4-7| = 6`. Thus, we have three cliques: {1,2,3}, {4,5,6}, and {7,8}.

```
**Explanation**: 
- With `n=8` and `k=13`, vertices (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), and (7,8) form edges but (1,3), (2,4), (3,5), (4,6), (5,7), and (6,8) do not since `|1-3| + |1-3| = 4`, `|2-4| + |2-4| = 4`, `|3-5| + |3-5| = 4`, `|4-6| + |4-6| = 4`, `|5-7| + |5-7| = 4`, and `|6-8| + |6-8| = 4`. Thus, we have four cliques: {1,2}, {3,4}, {5,6}, and {7,8}.
