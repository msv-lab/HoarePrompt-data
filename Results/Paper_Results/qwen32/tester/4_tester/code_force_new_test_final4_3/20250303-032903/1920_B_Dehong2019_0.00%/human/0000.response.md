```
1
1 3 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: Alice removes the only element, resulting in a sum of 0. However, since Alice can remove up to 3 elements, she removes the only element, and Bob multiplies it by -1, resulting in a sum of -1.

10 1 1
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
45
```
**Explanation**: Alice does not remove any elements. Bob multiplies 1 by -1, resulting in a sum of -1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 45 - 2 = 44 + 1 = 45.
