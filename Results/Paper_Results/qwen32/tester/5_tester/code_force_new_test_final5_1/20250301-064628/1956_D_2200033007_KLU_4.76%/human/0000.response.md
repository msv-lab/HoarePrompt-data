# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
3
1 3 9
```
**Output**: 
```
13 0
```
**Explanation**: The initial array already has a sum of 13, which is the maximum possible sum.

```
2
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
2 1
1 2
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of the array is 1, so setting both elements to 1 results in the maximum sum of 2.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
3
0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
3 1
1 3
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of the array is 1, so setting all elements to 1 results in the maximum sum of 3.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
4
0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
4 1
1 4
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of the array is 1, so setting all elements to 1 results in the maximum sum of 4.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
3
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3 1
1 3
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of the array is 0, so setting all elements to 0 results in the maximum sum of 0, but since the array is already filled with 1s, the MEX of the array is 0, and setting all elements to 0 does not change the sum. However, setting all elements to 1 results in the maximum sum of 3.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
4
2 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
4 1
1 4
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of the array is 0, so setting all elements to 0 results in the maximum sum of 0, but since the array is already filled with 2s, the MEX of the array is 0, and setting all elements to 0 does not change the sum. However, setting all elements to 1 results in the maximum sum of 4.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
4
0 1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
8 0
```
**Explanation**: The initial array already has a sum of 8, which is the maximum possible sum.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
4
0 1 2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
8 1
4 4
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of the array is 3, so setting the fourth element to 3 results in the maximum sum of 8.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
4
0 1 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
8 1
3 3
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of the array is 2, so setting the third element to 2 results in the maximum sum of 8.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
4
0 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
8 1
2 2
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of the array is 1, so setting the second element to 1 results in the maximum sum of 8.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
4
0 2 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
8 2
2 2
3 3
```
**Explanation**: First, set the second element to 1, then set the third element to 3, resulting in the maximum sum of 8.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
4
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
8 1
1 1
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of the array is 0, so setting the first element to 0 results in the maximum sum of 8, but since the array is already filled with 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s, the MEX of the array is 0, and setting the first element to 0 does not change the sum. However, setting the first element to 1 results in the maximum sum of 8.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
4
0 0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4 2
1 2
3 4
```
**Explanation**: First, set the first and second elements to 2, then set the third and fourth elements to 2, resulting in the maximum sum of 4.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
18
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
18 1
1 18
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of the array is 1, so setting all elements to 1 results in the maximum sum of 18.

# Test 19
**Input**: 
```
18
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
18 1
1 18
```
**Explanation**: The MEX of the array is 0, so setting all elements to 0 results in the maximum sum of 0, but since the array is already filled with 1s, the MEX of the array is 0, and setting all elements to 0 does not change the sum. However, setting all elements to 1 results in the maximum sum of 18.

# Test 20
**Input**: 
```
18
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17
```
**Output**: 
```
153 0
```
**Explanation**: The initial array already has a sum of 153, which is the maximum possible sum.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic operations, edge cases with all elements being the same, and cases where the array is already optimal.
