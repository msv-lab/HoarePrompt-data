Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
**Explanation**: We need a subsequence that adds up to 1 but not 2. The sequence [1] satisfies this.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
6 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
2 3 4 5 6
```
**Explanation**: All elements are greater than k=1, so no subsequence adds up to 1. Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

```
1
8 8
```
**Output**: 
```
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1 3
```
**Explanation**: We need subsequences to sum up to 1 and 3 but not 2. The sequence [1, 3] satisfies this.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10 5
```
**Output**: 
```
5
1 2 4 8 9
```
**Explanation**: We need subsequences to sum up to all numbers from 1 to 10 except 5. The sequence [1, 2, 4, 8, 9] can form sums 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 except 5.
