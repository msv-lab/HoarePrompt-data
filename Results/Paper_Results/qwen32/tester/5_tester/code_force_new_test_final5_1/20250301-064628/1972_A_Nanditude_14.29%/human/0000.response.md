Sure, let's create a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem. These test cases will cover both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

### Basic Test Cases

**Test 1**: Simple case where no new problems are needed.
```
# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The difficulties of the proposed problems are already within the expected limits.

**Test 2**: Simple case where one new problem is needed.
```
# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 5
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Adding a problem with difficulty 3 will make the array [1, 2, 3].

**Test 3**: Simple case where all problems need to be replaced.
```
# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
4 5 6
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: All problems need to be replaced with problems of difficulty 1, 2, and 3.

### Edge Test Cases

**Test 4**: Maximum number of test cases with minimum number of problems.
```
# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
100
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
0
0
...
0
```
**Explanation**: Each test case has only one problem, and it is already within the expected limit.

**Test 5**: Maximum number of test cases with maximum number of problems.
```
# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
100
100
1 1 1 ... 1 (100 times)
1 1 1 ... 1 (100 times)
```
**Output**: 
```
0
0
0
...
0
```
**Explanation**: Each test case has 100 problems, all of which are already within the expected limit.

**Test 6**: All problems in `a` are greater than all problems in `b`.
```
# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3
4 5 6
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: All problems in `a` need to be replaced with problems of difficulty 1, 2, and 3.

**Test 7**: All problems in `a` are equal and less than all problems in `b`.
```
# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 1
2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: No new problems are needed as all problems in `a` are already within the expected limit.

**Test 8**: All problems in `a` are equal and greater than all problems in `b`.
```
# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3
3 3 3
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: All problems in `a` need to be replaced with problems of difficulty 1, 1, and 1.

**Test 9**: Mixed case with varying difficulties.
```
# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1000 1400 2000 2000 2200 2700
800 1200 1500 1800 2200 3000
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Adding problems with difficulty 800 and 1800 will make the array [800, 1000, 1400, 1800, 2000, 2000].

**Test 10**: Large numbers and large number of problems.
```
# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100
1 2 3 ... 100 (100 times)
100 101 102 ... 199 (100 times)
```
**Output**: 
```
99
```
**Explanation**: All problems in `a` need to be replaced with problems of difficulty 100, 101, ..., 198.

**Test 11**: All problems in `a` are equal and exactly equal to all problems in `b`.
```
# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 2 2
2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: No new problems are needed as all problems in `a` are already within the expected limit.

**Test 12**: All problems in `a` are equal and just below all problems in `b`.
```
# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 1
2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: No new problems are needed as all problems in `a` are already within the expected limit.

**Test 13**: All problems in `a` are equal and just above all problems in `b`.
```
# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
3
3 3 3
2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: All problems in `a` need to be replaced with problems of difficulty 2, 2, and 2.

These test cases should help ensure that the solution is robust and handles a wide range of scenarios.
