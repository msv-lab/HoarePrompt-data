```
3
0 1 2
```
# Explanation: The array [0, 1, 2] has exactly 8 increasing subsequences, but this test case is intentionally set to test the edge case of the number of subsequences being slightly off to ensure the function handles such cases gracefully.

```
1
1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
# Explanation: The number of increasing subsequences requested is extremely large and exceeds the capability of any reasonable array length constraint, hence it is impossible to construct such an array.

```
1
100000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```

```
1
1048576
```
**Output**:

# Explanation: The number of increasing subsequences requested exceeds the maximum possible with an array of length 20, hence it is impossible to construct such an array.

# Test 19
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
# Explanation: According to the problem statement, the minimum number of increasing subsequences is 2, so 1 is an invalid input.
