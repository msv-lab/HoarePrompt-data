Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: There is only one sign with a periodicity of 3 years, so it will occur in the 3rd year.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
*Explanation*: The first sign occurs in year 2, and the second sign occurs in year 4 (but we start waiting after year 2, so the next occurrence is in year 4, then year 6).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
5 10 15
```
**Output**: 
```
30
```
*Explanation*: The first sign occurs in year 5, the second in year 10, and the third in year 15 (but we start waiting after year 10, so the next occurrence is in year 15, then year 30).

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The only sign occurs every year, so it will occur in the 1st year.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
*Explanation*: All signs occur every year, so they will occur in years 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
20
```
*Explanation*: All signs occur every 2 years, so they will occur in years 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20 respectively.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
5000000
```
*Explanation*: All signs occur every 1,000,000 years, so they will occur in years 1,000,000, 2,000,000, 3,000,000, 4,000,000, and 5,000,000 respectively.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
*Explanation*: The first sign occurs in year 1, the second in year 2, and the third in year 9 (since we start waiting after year 2, the next occurrence is in year 3, then year 6, then year 9).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
4
2 3 5 7
```
**Output**: 
```
70
```
*Explanation*: The first sign occurs in year 2, the second in year 3, the third in year 5, and the fourth in year 70 (since we start waiting after year 5, the next occurrence is in year 7, then year 14, then year 21, then year 28, then year 35, then year 42, then year 49, then year 56, then year 63, then year 70).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1000001
```
*Explanation*: The first sign occurs in year 1,000,000, and the second sign occurs in year 1,000,001 (since we start waiting after year 1,000,000, the next occurrence is in year 1,000,001).

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1000000 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
2000001
```
*Explanation*: The first sign occurs in year 1, the second in year 1,000,001, and the third in year 2,000,001 (since we start waiting after year 1,000,001, the next occurrence is in year 2,000,001).

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1000000 2000000
```
**Output**: 
```
3000000
```
*Explanation*: The first sign occurs in year 1,000,000, and the second sign occurs in year 2,000,000 (since we start waiting after year 1,000,000, the next occurrence is in year 2,000,000), and the third sign occurs in year 3,000,000 (since we start waiting after year 2,000,000, the next occurrence is in year 3,000,000).

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including the smallest and largest possible inputs, as well as cases with signs occurring at different intervals.
