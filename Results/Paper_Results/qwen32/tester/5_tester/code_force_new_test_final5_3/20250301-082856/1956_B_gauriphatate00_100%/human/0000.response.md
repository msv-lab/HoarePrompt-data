**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: This is the fifth example from the problem statement. With only one card, no points can be scored.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Both players have the same card. The player plays first, places the card, and gets 0 points since the second card is placed by Nene.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Each player has a different card. No pairs can be formed, so the player gets 0 points.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 2 3 ... 100000 1 2 3 ... 100000
```
**Output**: 
```
50000
```
**Explanation**: The player has 50000 pairs. Assuming optimal play, the player can score 50000 points.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 1 2 2 ... 50000 50000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The player has all pairs, but Nene plays optimally to prevent the player from scoring any points.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
0
```
**Explanation**: Two test cases with different distributions. In both, no pairs can be formed, so both players get 0 points.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The player has one pair and one unique card. Nene can prevent the player from scoring by playing optimally.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 1 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The player has two pairs. Nene can play optimally to ensure the player scores 0 points.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1 2 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The player has two pairs and one unique card. Nene can prevent the player from scoring by playing optimally.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
6
