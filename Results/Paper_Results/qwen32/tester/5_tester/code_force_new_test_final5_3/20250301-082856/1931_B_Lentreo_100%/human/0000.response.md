Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
43
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Only one container, so it's trivially possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water (1 + 3 = 4) is divisible by 2, but we cannot redistribute the water to make both containers have 2 units each because the operation requires pouring from a lower-indexed container to a higher-indexed one.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
4 5 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: We can redistribute the water to make all containers have 3 units each as shown in the example.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water (1 + 2 + 3 = 6) is divisible by 3, but we cannot redistribute the water to make all containers have 2 units each because the operation constraints prevent it.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
7
4 5 5 0 6 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water (4 + 5 + 5 + 0 + 6 + 4 + 4 = 28) is divisible by 7, but we cannot redistribute the water to make all containers have 4 units each due to the constraints.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
7
6 5 5 1 3 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: We can redistribute the water to make all containers have 4 units each.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Both containers are already empty, so they trivially have the same amount of water.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2
10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Both containers already have the same amount of water.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water (1 + 1 + 2 = 4) is divisible by 3, but we cannot redistribute the water to make all containers have 1 unit each due to the constraints.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water (55) is not divisible by 10, but since the problem guarantees divisibility, this test case is invalid for the problem statement. However, it's useful to test the edge case where the sum is not divisible by n.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 1 1 ... 1 1 (100000 ones)
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers already have the same amount of water, so it's trivially possible.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
0 0 0 ... 0 1000000000 (one 1000000000 at the end)
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water (1000000000) is divisible by 100000, but we cannot redistribute the water to make all containers have 10 units each due to the constraints.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1000000000 0 0 ... 0 0 (one 1000000000 at the start)
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water (1000000000) is divisible by 100000, but we cannot redistribute the water to make all containers have 10 units each due to the constraints.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Both containers already have the same amount of water, so it's trivially possible.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1000000000 0 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water (2000000000) is divisible by 3, but we cannot redistribute the water to make all containers have 666666666.67 units each due to the constraints.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the solution is robust, reliable, and scalable.
