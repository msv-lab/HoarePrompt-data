Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios:

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
43
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Only one container, so it is trivially possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water is 4, which is divisible by 2, but it is impossible to equalize the water in two containers with 1 and 3 units of water using the given operation.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
4 5 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water is 15, which is divisible by 5. It is possible to equalize the water to 3 units in each container.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water is 6, which is divisible by 3, but it is impossible to equalize the water in three containers with 1, 2, and 3 units of water using the given operation.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
7
4 5 5 0 6 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water is 28, which is divisible by 7. However, it is impossible to equalize the water in seven containers with the given units.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
7
6 5 5 1 3 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water is 28, which is divisible by 7. It is possible to equalize the water to 4 units in each container.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: Both containers are empty, so they already have the same amount of water.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers already have the same amount of water.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water is 55, which is not divisible by 10, but the problem guarantees the sum is divisible by n, so this case is invalid for the problem statement.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers already have the same amount of water.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water is 2,000,000,000, which is divisible by 2. It is possible to equalize the water to 1,000,000,000 units in each container.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water is 3, which is divisible by 3, but it is impossible to equalize the water in three containers with 0, 0, and 3 units of water using the given operation.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
2
500000000 500000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water is 1,000,000,000, which is divisible by 2. It is possible to equalize the water to 500,000,000 units in each container.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1000000000 0
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water is 1,000,000,000, which is divisible by 2, but it is impossible to equalize the water in two containers with 1,000,000,000 and 0 units of water using the given operation.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
1 1 1 ... 1 1 1  # 100000 ones
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The sum of water is 100,000, which is divisible by 100,000. All containers already have the same amount of water.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
100000
0 0 0 ... 0 0 0  # 100000 zeros
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers are empty, so they already have the same amount of water.

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including edge cases with large inputs and minimal inputs, ensuring the robustness of the solution.
