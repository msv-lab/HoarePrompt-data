Sure, let's create comprehensive test cases for the given problem. We'll cover both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the robustness and reliability of the solution.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
**Explanation**: The only number less than 2 is 1, which can be formed by the sequence [1]. No subsequence sums to 2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
6 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
2 3 4 5 6
```
**Explanation**: All numbers from 2 to 6 can be formed by subsequences of [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. No subsequence sums to 1.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
8 8
```
**Output**: 
```
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: All numbers from 1 to 7 can be formed by subsequences of [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. No subsequence sums to 8.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
9 3
```
**Output**: 
```
4
7 1 4 1
```
**Explanation**: All numbers from 1 to 9 except 3 can be formed by subsequences of [7, 1, 4, 1]. No subsequence sums to 3.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10 7
```
**Output**: 
```
4
1 2 8 3
```
**Explanation**: All numbers from 1 to 10 except 7 can be formed by subsequences of [1, 2, 8, 3]. No subsequence sums to 7.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
2
```
**Explanation**: The only number less than 1 is not present, and no subsequence sums to 1. The number 2 can be formed by the sequence [2].

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1000000
```
**Explanation**: All numbers from 2 to 1000000 can be formed by subsequences of [1000000]. No subsequence sums to 1.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
999999
1 1 1 ... 1 1
```
**Explanation**: All numbers from 1 to 999999 can be formed by subsequences of [1, 1, 1, ..., 1, 1] (999999 ones). No subsequence sums to 1000000.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
500000 250000
```
**Output**: 
```
25
1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: This sequence covers all sums from 1 to 499999 except 250000 using the powers of 2 and additional 1s to cover the gaps.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 500000
```
**Output**: 
```
25
1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: This sequence covers all sums from 1 to 999999 except 500000 using the powers of 2 and additional 1s to cover the gaps.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1000
2 2
2 2
2 2
...
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
1
1
...
1
```
**Explanation**: Repeated test cases of the simplest scenario where the sequence [1] suffices for all test cases.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1000
1000000 1
1000000 1
1000000 1
...
1000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1000000
1
1000000
1
1000000
...
1
1000000
```
**Explanation**: Repeated test cases of the scenario where the sequence [1000000] suffices for all test cases.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring that the solution is robust and handles both basic and edge cases effectively.
