Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the given problem. Here's a brief explanation of why:

1. **Input Parsing**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are used to parse the input correctly, which is necessary for the problem's requirements.
2. **Main Logic**:
   - The function `func_5` reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the favorite number `x`.
   - It then reads the array `a`.
   - The main logic iterates over the bits from 29 down to 0 (since `x` is less than \(2^{30}\)).
     - It checks if the current bit of `x` and the sum of the corresponding bits in the array `a` match.
     - Depending on the conditions, it either splits the array into segments or updates the answer.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum suitable number `k` or `-1` if no such `k` exists.

The logic seems to handle all the constraints and requirements of the problem accurately. Therefore, the given program is correct.
