Output State: `t` is an empty list, `ans` is 14.

Explanation: The loop iterates over `i` from 29 to 0. The key operations within the loop involve manipulating the bits of the elements in list `a` and updating the variable `ans`. Given the conditions and operations, the maximum count `cnt` that satisfies the criteria is found to be 14, which is stored in `ans`. The list `t` remains empty as no elements are appended to it during the loop's execution.
