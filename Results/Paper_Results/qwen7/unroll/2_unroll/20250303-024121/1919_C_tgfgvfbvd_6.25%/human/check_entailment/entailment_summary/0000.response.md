Reasoning:
1. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the penalties for the subsequences `s` and `t`.
2. The program attempts to identify elements in the array that are either greater than both `a` and `b` or less than both `a` and `b`, but this approach does not align with the problem's requirements.
3. The problem requires splitting the array into two subsequences such that the penalty (number of indices where elements are in increasing order) is minimized. The given program does not attempt to split the array into these subsequences or calculate the penalties for them.
4. The program only counts a specific condition (elements that are either greater than both `a` and `b` or less than both `a` and `b`) and prints this count, which does not reflect the actual penalty calculation needed.

Given the above points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
