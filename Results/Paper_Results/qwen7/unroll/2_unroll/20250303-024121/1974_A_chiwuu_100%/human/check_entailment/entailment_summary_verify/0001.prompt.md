You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b
        if t % 2 == 0:
            t = t // 2
        else:
            t = t // 2 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it calculates a value \(t\) based on certain conditions and prints the final value of \(t\). Initially, \(t\) is set to \(b\), and it is adjusted based on whether \(t \times 15 - b \times 4\) is greater than or equal to \(a\). If not, \(t\) is incremented further depending on the remainder when \(a - t \times 15 + b \times 4\) is divided by 15. The function ultimately outputs the final value of \(t\) for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculation of Required Space for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The variable `t` is initialized to `b` (number of 2x2 icons).
   - If `t` is even, `t` is divided by 2.
   - If `t` is odd, `t` is divided by 2 and incremented by 1. This calculation determines the number of 2x2 icons that can fit into the grid without overlapping.

3. **Space Calculation for Remaining 1x1 Icons:**
   - The remaining space after placing `t` 2x2 icons is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. Here, `15` is the total number of cells per screen, and `4` is the number of cells occupied by each 2x2 icon.
   - If the remaining space (`t1`) is greater than or equal to `a` (number of 1x1 icons), it means all 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space, so `t` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, the remaining 1x1 icons need additional screens. The number of additional screens required is calculated as `a - t1` divided by 15, rounded up to the nearest integer using the formula `t2 // 15 + 1`.

4. **Output:**
   - The total number of screens required is printed for each test case.

### Verification with Examples:

Let's verify the logic with some examples from the problem statement:

- **Example 1:** `1 1`
  - `t = 1` (since `b = 1` and `1 % 2 != 0`)
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`
  - Since `11 >= 1`, `t` remains `1`.
  - Output: `1`

- **Example 2:** `7 2`
  - `t = 2` (since `b = 2` and `2 % 2 == 0`)
  - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 22`
  - Since `22 >= 7`, `t` remains `2`.
  - Output: `2`

- **Example 3:** `12 4`
  - `t = 2` (since `b = 4` and `4 % 2 == 0`)
  - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 22`
  - Since `22 >= 12`, `t` remains `2`.
  - Output: `2`

- **Example 4:** `0 3`
  - `t = 1` (since `b = 3` and `3 % 2 != 0`)
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 3 * 4 = 9`
  - Since `9 < 0`, we need additional screens.
  - `t2 = 0 - 9 = -9` (which is not possible, so we consider `t2 = 0` and add 1 screen).
  - Output: `1`

- **Example 5:** `8 1`
  - `t = 1` (since `b = 1` and `1 % 2 != 0`)
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`
  - Since `11 >= 8`, `t` remains `1`.
  - Output: `1`

- **Example 6:** `0 9`
  - `t = 2` (since `b = 9` and `9 % 2 != 0`)
  - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 9 * 4 = 6`
  - Since `6 < 0`, we need additional screens.
  - `t2 = 0 - 6 = -6` (which is not possible, so we consider `t2 = 0` and add 1 screen).
  - Output: `5`

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required to place the given icons according to the problem constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
