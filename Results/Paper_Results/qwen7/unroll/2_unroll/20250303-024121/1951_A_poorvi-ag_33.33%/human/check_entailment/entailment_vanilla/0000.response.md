Reasoning:
The provided Python program and the problem description do not seem to match. The given program `func` is designed to process a series of binary strings and determine certain conditions about them, while the problem description asks for a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` that generates specific files based on directory names containing numbers within a specified range.

Since the given program `func` does not implement the functionality described in the problem (generating files for HTML files in specified directories), it cannot be considered correct for the given task.

Correctness: **False**
