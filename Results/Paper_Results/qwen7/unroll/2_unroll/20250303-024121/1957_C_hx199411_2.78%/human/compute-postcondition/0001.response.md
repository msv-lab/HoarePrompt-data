The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Since `t` is a non-negative integer within this range, it already satisfies the condition `t` being non-zero.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
