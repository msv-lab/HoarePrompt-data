Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is the third element of `r` plus `a`, `y1` is the second element of `r`, `x2` is the fifth element of `r` minus `a`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r` plus `a`, `y1` is equal to `m`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `x1` is less than or equal to `x2`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The code `y2 += a` increments the value of `y2` by `a`. Since `y2` was originally the sixth element of `r`, the new value of `y2` is now the sixth element of `r` plus `a`. All other conditions and relationships between the variables remain unchanged.
