Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is the third element of `r` plus `a`, `y1` is 1, `x2` is the fifth element of `r` minus `a`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r` minus `a`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `x1` is less than or equal to `x2`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, and `y1` is less than or equal to `y2`**.

Explanation: The code `y2 -= a` subtracts `a` from `y2`. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions involving these variables are updated accordingly. Specifically, `y2` is now `y2 - a`, but the relationships between `y1` and `y2` (i.e., `y1` is not equal to `y2`) and other conditions like `t` being the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` remain valid.
