Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is the third element of `r` plus `a`, `y1` is the fourth element of `r`, `x2` is the fifth element of `r`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r`, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`**.

Explanation: The value of `x1` is incremented by `a`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still `abs(y2 - y1)`, and the value of `b` remains `x2 - x1`.
