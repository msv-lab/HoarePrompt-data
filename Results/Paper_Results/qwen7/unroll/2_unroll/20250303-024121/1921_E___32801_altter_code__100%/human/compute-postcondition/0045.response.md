Output State: **`r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is two more than its original value, `y1` is one less than its original value plus `a`, `y2` is now equal to `m`, `x2` is always greater than `x1`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `x2` is decreased by `a`, and `(x2 > x1 and x1 >= 1 and x2 <= n) and (y2 > y1); c is m - y1**.

This means that the value of `c` is calculated as `m - y1`. All other conditions and relationships among the variables remain unchanged.
