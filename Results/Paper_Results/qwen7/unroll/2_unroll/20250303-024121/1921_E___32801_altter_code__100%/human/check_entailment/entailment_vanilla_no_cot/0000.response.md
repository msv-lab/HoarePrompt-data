Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly determining the outcome of the game:

1. **Function `func_1` is incomplete**: The function `func_1` is defined but never called properly within the loop that processes each test case. The correct implementation should call `func_1()` inside the loop.

2. **Incorrect handling of Alice's and Bob's moves**: The logic for determining the winner based on the relative positions of Alice and Bob's chips is flawed. Specifically, the conditions for Alice and Bob winning are not correctly implemented.

3. **Edge cases are not handled properly**: The program does not handle all edge cases, such as when Alice or Bob reaches the boundary of the board, which would result in a draw.

4. **Incorrect use of variables and conditions**: The program uses variables and conditions in a way that does not accurately reflect the rules of the game. For example, the logic for checking if a player can win is overly complex and not aligned with the game's rules.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
tt = int(input())

def func_1():
    r = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (n, m, x1, y1, x2, y2) = (r[0], r[1], r[2], r[3], r[4], r[5])

    # Alice starts and can only move down, down-right, or down-left
    # Bob moves up, up-right, or up-left
    # If Alice can reach Bob's position before Bob can reach Alice's position, Alice wins
    # Otherwise, if Bob can always avoid being captured, Bob wins

    # If Alice is in the last row, she cannot move down anymore, so it's a draw
    if x1 == n:
        print("Draw")
        return

    # If Bob is in the first row, he cannot move up anymore, so it's a draw
    if x2 == 1:
        print("Draw")
        return

    # Calculate the minimum distance Alice needs to move to capture Bob
    alice_moves = min(abs(x2 - x1), abs(y2 - y1))
    bob_moves = min(abs(x2 - 1), abs(y2 - 1))

    # If Alice can capture Bob in fewer moves than Bob can avoid being captured, Alice wins
    if alice_moves <= bob_moves:
        print("Alice")
    else:
        print("Bob")

for _ in range(tt):
    func_1()
```

This corrected program handles the game logic more accurately and ensures that the outcomes are determined correctly based on the optimal moves of both players.
