The function accepts three parameters: `n`, representing the number of integers in the list `nums`; `m`, determining when Sasha wins; and `nums`, a list of integers each between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. It calculates the sum of the lengths of the string representations of each integer in `nums` and subtracts the values at even indices of the sorted zero counts of each integer in `nums`. If this result is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, it returns 'Sasha', otherwise it returns 'Anna'.
