### Reasoning:

1. **Function `zerocnts` Analysis:**
   - This function correctly calculates the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of an integer `num` (where \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\)).
   - It iterates through the string representation of `num` from the end to the beginning and counts the number of trailing zeros until it encounters a non-zero digit.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - This function aims to determine the winner based on the sum of the lengths of the string representations of each integer in `nums` minus the values at even indices of the sorted zero counts of each integer in `nums`.
   - The logic inside `func_1`:
     - Converts each integer in `nums` to its string representation and sums their lengths.
     - Computes the zero counts for each integer using `zerocnts` and sorts these counts in descending order.
     - Iterates over the sorted zero counts, subtracting every second value (starting from the highest).
     - Checks if the resulting sum is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\). If true, it returns 'Sasha'; otherwise, it returns 'Anna'.

3. **Game Rules and Winning Condition:**
   - The game involves alternating moves between Anna and Sasha.
   - Anna can reverse the digits of any number, and Sasha can concatenate two numbers.
   - The game ends when Sasha cannot make a move, meaning only one number remains, and Sasha wins if this number is at least \(10^m\).

4. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` seems to capture a key aspect of the game: the sum of the lengths of the numbers minus the zero counts (which affects the number's magnitude) determines the outcome.
   - The approach considers the strategic advantage of having larger numbers remaining in the list, which aligns with the winning condition.

5. **Edge Cases and Validity:**
   - The code handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, such as the range of integers and the sum of lengths.
   - The logic ensures that the game state is correctly evaluated based on the given rules.

Given the analysis, the provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
