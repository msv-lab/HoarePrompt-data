Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the program, we need to verify if the logic implemented in `func_1` aligns with the rules of the game and the problem statement. Let's break down the key aspects:

1. **Game Rules**:
   - Anna reverses the digits of an integer.
   - Sasha concatenates two integers.
   - The game ends when Sasha can no longer make a move, and the remaining number must be checked against \(10^m\).

2. **Function `zerocnts`**:
   - This function correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of an integer. This is used to calculate the total number of trailing zeros across all numbers in the list.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function calculates the total length of the numbers in the list (`tot`).
   - It sorts the zero counts of each number in descending order (`cntvals`).
   - It then iteratively subtracts the zero counts at even indices from `tot`.
   - Finally, it checks if `tot` is greater than or equal to `m + 1` and returns 'Sasha' or 'Anna' accordingly.

Let's analyze the logic:
- The total length of the numbers (`tot`) represents the combined length of the numbers after Anna's moves.
- Subtracting the zero counts at even indices (`cntvals[i]` for even `i`) accounts for the effect of Anna's moves on the total length.
- If the resulting `tot` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, it implies that Sasha can still form a number large enough to win.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the logic seems sound. The function correctly implements the strategy to determine the winner based on the remaining length of the numbers and the threshold `m`.

Therefore, the implementation appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution summaries.

Correctness: **True**
