Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes multiple lists and integers across several test cases. For each test case, it takes integers t, n, m, k, a (a list of n integers), and b (a list of m integers) as inputs. It returns a result based on the given conditions and constraints.**

- Each test case is defined by an integer `t` where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`.
- For each test case, integers `n`, `m`, and `k` are provided such that `1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5`.
- A list `a` containing `n` integers, each satisfying `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6`.
- A list `b` containing `m` integers, each satisfying `1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6`.
- The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed `2⋅10^5`, and the sum of `m` across all test cases does not exceed `2⋅10^5`.

The function processes these inputs according to specified conditions and returns a result for each test case.
