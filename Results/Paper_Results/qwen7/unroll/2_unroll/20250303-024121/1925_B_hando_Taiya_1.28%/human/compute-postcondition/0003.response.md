Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `ans` is the maximum value between any divisor `i` of `x` and the corresponding cofactor `x // i` where either `i` or `x // i` is less than or equal to `n`.
