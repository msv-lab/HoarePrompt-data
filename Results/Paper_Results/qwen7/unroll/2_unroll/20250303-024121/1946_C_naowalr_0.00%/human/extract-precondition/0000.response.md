Precondition: **a is an integer representing the current vertex being processed, p is an integer representing the parent vertex of the current vertex, adj is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, x is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component, and numCuts is an integer counter initialized to 0 that keeps track of the number of cuts made during the DFS traversal.**
