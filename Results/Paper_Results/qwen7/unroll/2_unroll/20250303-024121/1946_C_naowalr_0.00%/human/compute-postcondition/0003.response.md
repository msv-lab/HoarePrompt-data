Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `sys.stdin.readline()` is called to read the next line which will contain the value of `t`, for each of the `t` cases, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `k` < `n` ≤ 10^5, `adj` is the adjacency list constructed based on the input edges, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` keeps track of the number of edges removed during the DFS traversal, and `leftover` represents the number of vertices in the largest connected component found during the DFS traversal, after executing the binary search to find the maximum size of the largest connected component that can remain after removing `k` edges, the result `L` is printed for each case.
