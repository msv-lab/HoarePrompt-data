The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case includes the number of vertices (n), the number of edges to remove (k), and the adjacency list (adj) representing the graph. It then performs a binary search to find the maximum size of the largest connected component that can remain after removing k edges. Finally, it prints the result for each test case, which is the maximum possible size of the largest remaining connected component.
