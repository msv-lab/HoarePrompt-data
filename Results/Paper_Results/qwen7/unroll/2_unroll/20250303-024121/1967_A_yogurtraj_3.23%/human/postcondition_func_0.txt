The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t`, followed by two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it redistributes the values in list `a` based on the value of `k`. It calculates the maximum value `r` that can be achieved after redistribution and any remaining redistribution points `rem`. Additionally, it counts the number of cards `y` that receive the final increment. Finally, it prints the result based on the calculated values.
