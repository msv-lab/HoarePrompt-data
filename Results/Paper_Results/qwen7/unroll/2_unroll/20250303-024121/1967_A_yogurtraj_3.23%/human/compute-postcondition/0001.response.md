Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}. The list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{12}, representing the number of cards of each type after the loop has executed all the iterations. The variable r is an integer representing the maximum value in the sorted list a after adjustments. The variable rem is an integer representing the remaining value of k after the loop. The variable y is an integer representing the count of elements from the last element of the list a that were adjusted during the loop.
