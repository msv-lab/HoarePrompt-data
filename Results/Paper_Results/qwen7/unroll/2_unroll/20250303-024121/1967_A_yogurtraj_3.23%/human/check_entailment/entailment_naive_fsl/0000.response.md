Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the logic for determining the maximum score is flawed. The program attempts to find a way to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]` by redistributing the cards. However, the current implementation does not properly account for all possible ways to redistribute the cards to achieve the maximum score.

For instance, consider the following test case:

- Input:
```
3 4
6 1 8
```

- Expected Output:
```
22
```

- Program Output:
```
15
```

The program fails to handle the scenario where the cards can be redistributed in a way that maximizes the number of valid subarrays. A correct approach would involve more sophisticated logic to ensure that the redistribution strategy maximizes the score. The current implementation does not guarantee that the maximum score is achieved in all cases.
