Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the hour is exactly 12 correctly. According to the problem description, when the hour is 12 in the 24-hour format, it should be represented as "12:xx PM" in the 12-hour format. However, the program incorrectly sets `day` to 'AM' when the hour is 12, regardless of whether it is the first half of the day or the second half. This can be seen in the test case "12:14", which should output "12:14 PM" but instead outputs "12:14 AM".

To fix this, the condition for setting `day` to 'PM' should be changed to check if the hour is greater than or equal to 12. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
            if h == 12:
                day = 'PM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')


func()
```

However, the above code still has an issue because it sets `day` to 'PM' when `h` is 12, which is incorrect. The correct logic should be:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h -= 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
            if h == 12:
                day = 'PM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')


func()
```

But the simplest and most correct way to handle this is:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
        elif h > 12:
            h -= 12
        day = 'AM' if h < 12 else 'PM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')


func()
```

This ensures that the hour is correctly converted to the 12-hour format and the correct AM/PM indicator is used.
