State: **`day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the variables in the loop head: The loop uses `_` as the iterator variable and `range(n)` to determine the number of iterations. The only variable from the loop head that affects the loop's execution is `n`.

2. Determine the condition for loop execution: The loop will execute if `n` is a positive integer (greater than 0). 

3. Adjust the state: Since the initial state of `day` is 'AM' and it does not affect the loop's execution, it remains unchanged. However, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` must be greater than 0.
