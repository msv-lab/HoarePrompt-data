Functionality: **The function processes a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, along with two integers n and k. It sorts the first half and the second half of the list separately. Based on the value of k, it constructs two lists, ans1 and ans2, by selecting elements from the sorted halves, ensuring no element is repeated more than necessary. Finally, it prints these two lists for each test case.**
