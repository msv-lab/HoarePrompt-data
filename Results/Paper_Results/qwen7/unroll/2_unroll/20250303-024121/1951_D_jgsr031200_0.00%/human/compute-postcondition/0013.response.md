Output State: `h` is the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`, `n` is 0.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the `costs` list. Initially, `costs[0]` is `n - k + 1` and `costs[1]` is `1`. In each iteration, `curr` is set to `n` divided by the current element in `costs`, then `h` is incremented by `curr`, and `n` is decreased by `i * curr`. Since `n` starts at a positive value and is reduced by its integer division with both `n - k + 1` and `1`, eventually `n` will become `0`. The final value of `h` is the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`.
