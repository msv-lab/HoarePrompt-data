Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Prices**: The function `func_1` tries to use a binary search approach which is not appropriate for this problem. The problem requires setting up stalls with specific prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

2. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The code attempts to use binary search (`bs`) but never calls it.
   - The logic to determine the number of stalls and their prices is flawed. It does not correctly distribute the prices among the stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**:
   - For example, when `n == k`, the solution prints `1` stall with price `1`, which is correct but the implementation is overly simplistic and does not generalize well.
   - When `n < k`, the solution incorrectly prints `NO` without trying to find a valid configuration of stalls.

4. **Incomplete Implementation**:
   - The commented-out code for binary search is not used, and the actual implementation does not cover all necessary cases.

### Correct Solution Outline:

To solve this problem correctly, you should:
- Determine the number of stalls needed.
- Distribute the prices among the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
- Ensure the prices are within the constraints (1 to \(10^{18}\)).

Here is a more detailed outline of how you might implement the correct solution:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    # If n is less than k, it's impossible to buy k jewels
    if n < k:
        print("NO")
        return
    
    # Initialize the number of stalls
    num_stalls = 0
    current_price = 1
    jewels_bought = 0
    
    while jewels_bought < k:
        # Calculate how many jewels can be bought at the current price
        jewels_can_buy = n // current_price
        if jewels_can_buy > 0:
            jewels_bought += jewels_can_buy
            n -= current_price * jewels_can_buy
            num_stalls += 1
        # Increase the price for the next stall
        current_price += 1
    
    # Check if we have bought exactly k jewels
    if jewels_bought == k:
        print("YES")
        print(num_stalls)
        print(' '.join(map(str, [current_price - 1] * num_stalls)))
    else:
        print("NO")

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(n, k)
```

This solution iteratively sets up stalls with increasing prices until Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
