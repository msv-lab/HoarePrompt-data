### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Base Case Handling**: For the base case where `n == k`, the program correctly prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with a price of 1 coin, ensuring Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

3. **Case Where `n < k`**: If `n < k`, the program correctly prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy even one jewel.

4. **General Case (`n >= k`)**:
   - The program calculates the necessary number of stalls and their prices.
   - It initializes `costs` with two values: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - It then iterates over these costs, calculating how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall and updating `n` accordingly.
   - After the loop, it checks if the total number of stalls (`h`) is at least `k`. If not, it prints "NO".
   - If `h` is at least `k`, it prints "YES" and the number of stalls, followed by the prices of the stalls.

5. **Output Validation**:
   - The output format matches the requirements specified in the problem statement.
   - The logic for setting up the stalls and their prices ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly handles all the given test cases and follows the problem's specifications accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
