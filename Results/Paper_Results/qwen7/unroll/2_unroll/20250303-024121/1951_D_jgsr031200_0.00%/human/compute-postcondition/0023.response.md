Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n and k, both of which are positive integers within the range of 1 to 10^18. If n equals k, it prints 'YES' followed by 1 twice and returns the value of n. If n is less than k, it prints 'NO' and returns None. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of divisions of n by each element in the list [n - k + 1, 1], prints 'NO' if this sum is less than k, and prints 'YES', 2, and the list [n - k + 1, 1] if the sum is greater than or equal to k.**
