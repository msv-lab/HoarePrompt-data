Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18**.

This means that the initial value of `t` remains unchanged, while `n` and `k` are now assigned the values obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
