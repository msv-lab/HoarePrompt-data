### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
- Alice has `n` coins.
- Bob wants Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.
- Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel from 1 to \(10^{18}\).
- Alice buys jewels greedily, starting from the first stall and moving to the next until she runs out of coins.

#### Provided Program:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
    elif n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(n)
    elif k - 1 < n - k + 1:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(n - k + 1, 1)
    else:
        print('NO')
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes a series of test cases.
- It checks the relationship between `n` and `k` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions.
- If `n < k`, it prints 'NO'.
- If `n == k`, it prints 'YES', 1, and `n`.
- If `n > k` and `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, it prints 'YES', 2, `n - k + 1`, and 1.
- Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment stated that the program is incorrect because it fails to handle scenarios where more than two stalls are needed.

#### Evaluation:
1. **Case 1: \( n < k \)**
   - The program correctly prints 'NO' when Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels she needs to buy.
   
2. **Case 2: \( n == k \)**
   - The program correctly prints 'YES' and 1 stall with the price equal to `n`.

3. **Case 3: \( n > k \) and \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \)**
   - The program correctly prints 'YES' and 2 stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and 1.
   - This handles the scenario where Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels using two stalls.

4. **Case 4: \( n > k \) and \( k - 1 \geq n - k + 1 \)**
   - The program incorrectly prints 'NO' in this case.
   - However, this is not always true. We need to check if we can distribute the remaining coins across more than two stalls to achieve exactly `k` jewels.

#### Correct Solution:
To handle all cases correctly, we need to ensure that we can distribute the remaining coins across multiple stalls to achieve exactly `k` jewels. Here's a revised version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        stalls = []
        current_n = n
        for i in range(1, 61):
            if current_n >= k:
                stalls.append(k)
                break
            stalls.append(min(current_n, k))
            current_n -= min(current_n, k)
            k -= min(current_n // (i + 1), k)
        print(len(stalls))
        print(' '.join(map(str, stalls)))
```

This revised program:
- Checks if `n < k` and prints 'NO' if true.
- Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and calculates the number of stalls and their respective prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

### Final Evaluation:
The original program does not handle all cases correctly, as it fails to distribute the remaining coins across multiple stalls when necessary. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
