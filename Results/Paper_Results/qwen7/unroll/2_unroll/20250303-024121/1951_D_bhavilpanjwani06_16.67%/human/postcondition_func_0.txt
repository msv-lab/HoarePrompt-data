The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers: t, n, and k. It checks the relationship between n and k and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions. If n is less than k, it prints 'NO'. If n equals k, it prints 'YES', 1, and n. If n is greater than k and k - 1 is less than or equal to n - k + 1, it prints 'YES', 2, n - k + 1, and 1. In all cases, it does not return any value but modifies and prints the values of n and k as per the conditions.
