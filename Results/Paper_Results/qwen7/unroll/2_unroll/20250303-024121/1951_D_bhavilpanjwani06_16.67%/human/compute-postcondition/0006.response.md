Output: **1**

Explanation: According to the initial state, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\), and `k` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\). It is also given that `n` is equal to `k`. The print statement simply outputs the integer `1`, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`.
