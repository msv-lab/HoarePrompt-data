Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
2. The provided code attempts to solve this problem using a different approach. Instead of directly checking the condition for each pair (a, b), it uses a mathematical transformation to calculate the number of valid pairs.
3. The key part of the code is the calculation of `suma` using the formula:
   \[
   \text{suma} = \sum_{i=1}^{b} \left( \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} + 1 \right)
   \]
4. This formula is derived from a more complex mathematical analysis and is intended to count the valid pairs efficiently.
5. The final result is printed as `suma - 1`, which seems to be a correction factor applied to the sum.
6. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided code appears to be a valid and efficient solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of valid pairs (a, b) according to the given conditions and constraints.
