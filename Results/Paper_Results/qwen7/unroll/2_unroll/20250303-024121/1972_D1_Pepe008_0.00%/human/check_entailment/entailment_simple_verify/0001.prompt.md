You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Test Cases and Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
   - It splits the input string to get `a` and `b` from the input.

2. **Iterating Over Possible Pairs:**
   - The original code had nested loops iterating over possible values of `i` and `j`. However, this part was commented out.
   - Instead, the program uses a different approach where it iterates over `i` from 1 to `b`.

3. **Calculating `x`:**
   - The expression `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` seems to be an attempt to calculate something related to the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).
   - The term `x` is added to `suma`, which accumulates the count of valid pairs.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program checks if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` before adding `x` to `suma`. This ensures that the division operation does not result in a negative value, which could happen if `a < i * (i - 1)`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The final output is `suma - 1`, which subtracts one from the accumulated count. This might be a mistake or an optimization, but we need to verify if it aligns with the problem statement.

### Verification Against Example

Let's verify the logic using the example provided:

- For the input `2 3`:
  - Valid pairs: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1)
  - The program should output `3`.
  - Let's check the calculation:
    - For `i = 1`: \( x = (2 - 1 \cdot 0) // 1^2 + 1 = 3 \)
    - For `i = 2`: \( x = (2 - 2 \cdot 1) // 2^2 + 1 = 0 \)
    - Sum: `3 + 0 = 3`
    - Final output: `3 - 1 = 2` (which is incorrect)

- For the input `3 5`:
  - Valid pairs: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (3,1)
  - The program should output `5`.
  - Let's check the calculation:
    - For `i = 1`: \( x = (3 - 1 \cdot 0) // 1^2 + 1 = 4 \)
    - For `i = 2`: \( x = (3 - 2 \cdot 1) // 2^2 + 1 = 1 \)
    - For `i = 3`: \( x = (3 - 3 \cdot 2) // 3^2 + 1 = 0 \)
    - Sum: `4 + 1 + 0 = 5`
    - Final output: `5 - 1 = 4` (which is incorrect)

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\). The calculations and logic do not match the expected results based on the problem statement.
