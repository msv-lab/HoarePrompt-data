Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program uses a formula that does not accurately count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. 

To illustrate, let's consider a few test cases:

1. For the input \( (n, m) = (10, 8) \):
   - The expected output is 14.
   - However, the program calculates the result using a formula that does not correctly account for all valid pairs. The formula used in the program is:
     ```python
     x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
     ```
   - This formula does not correctly handle the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. For the input \( (n, m) = (1000000, 1145141) \):
   - The expected output is 1643498.
   - The program's approach fails to accurately count the valid pairs due to the incorrect formula.

A correct solution would involve iterating through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The provided program does not do this, leading to incorrect results for many inputs.
