You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        'for i in range(1,a+1):\n        for j in range(4,b+1):\n            if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0:\n                print(i,j)'
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)

    #State: Output State: T is an input integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, and for each iteration t in the range of T, the variable `suma` is calculated based on the given formula and printed, then the process repeats until all iterations are completed. The final output state will have executed all the iterations and printed the value of `suma - 1` for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two positive integers. For each test case, it calculates a value based on a specific formula and prints the result minus one. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program uses a formula that does not accurately count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. 

To illustrate, let's consider a few test cases:

1. For the input \( (n, m) = (10, 8) \):
   - The expected output is 14.
   - However, the program calculates the result using a formula that does not correctly account for all valid pairs. The formula used in the program is:
     ```python
     x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
     ```
   - This formula does not correctly handle the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. For the input \( (n, m) = (1000000, 1145141) \):
   - The expected output is 1643498.
   - The program's approach fails to accurately count the valid pairs due to the incorrect formula.

A correct solution would involve iterating through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The provided program does not do this, leading to incorrect results for many inputs.
