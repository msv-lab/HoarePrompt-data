Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9], `a` is the minimum value from the list `l`, `li` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `li`. The values of `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial state. The variable `a` also remains unchanged.
