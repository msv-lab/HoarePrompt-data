### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to verify if the given array `l` can form a progressive square with the given parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`. A progressive square is defined such that each element can be calculated using the formula \(a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d\).

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `c`, and `d` and the array `l`.
   - It then calls `func_1(n, c, d, l)` to check if the array `l` can form a progressive square.
   - In `func_1`, the minimum value in `l` is identified as `a_{1,1}`.
   - A list `li` is generated containing all possible values of the progressive square using the formula \(a + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d\) for all positions in the \(n \times n\) matrix.
   - Both `l` and `li` are sorted and compared. If they match, it means the array `l` can form a progressive square, and "yes" is returned; otherwise, "no" is returned.

3. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the starting value (`a_{1,1}`) and generates all possible values of the progressive square.
   - However, the approach to generating the list `li` has a flaw. The formula used to generate the elements of the progressive square should start from `a_{1,1}` and incrementally add `c` and `d` for each subsequent element in the sequence, but the current implementation does not account for the correct order of elements in the progressive square.
   - The current implementation generates all possible values without considering the correct order of elements in the progressive square. This can lead to incorrect results, especially when the array `l` contains duplicate values or when the values are not in the correct order.

To illustrate, consider the example provided in the problem description:
- For \( n = 3 \), \( c = 2 \), and \( d = 3 \), the expected progressive square is:
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 3 & 5 \\
  4 & 6 & 8 \\
  7 & 9 & 11 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
- If the array `l` is `[3, 9, 6, 5, 7, 1, 10, 4, 8]`, sorting this array gives `[1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, which matches the expected sorted order of the progressive square.

However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly generate the sequence of elements in the progressive square. It simply adds the minimum value to a linear combination of indices, which does not guarantee the correct order of elements.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is inaccurate because the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly generate the sequence of elements in the progressive square. Therefore, the program may produce incorrect results for certain inputs.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
