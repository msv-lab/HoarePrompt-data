You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, c and d are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, and l is a list of n^2 integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9].
def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):
        for h in range(0, n):
            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9], `a` is the minimum value from the list `l`, `li` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for each combination of `k` and `h` in the range of 0 to n-1.
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if (l == li) :
        return 'yes'
        #The program returns 'yes'
    #State: Postcondition: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9], `a` is the minimum value from the list `l`, `li` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for each combination of `k` and `h` in the range of 0 to n-1, `li` is not sorted, `l` is sorted.
    return 'no'
    #The program returns 'no'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 500), two integers `c` and `d` (where 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6), and a list `l` of n^2 integers (each integer in the range [1, 10^9]). It returns 'yes' in Case_1 and 'no' in Case_2.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'yes'

Case_2: The program returns 'no'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
