Functionality: **The function accepts an integer \( n \) (where \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \)), two integers \( c \) and \( d \) (where \( 1 \leq c, d \leq 10^6 \)), and a list \( l \) of \( n^2 \) integers (each integer in the range [1, \( 10^9 \)]). It calculates a new list \( li \) where each element is formed by adding the minimum value of \( l \) to a linear combination of indices \( k \) and \( h \) scaled by \( c \) and \( d \). Both \( l \) and \( li \) are then sorted. If the sorted lists \( l \) and \( li \) are identical, the function returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'.**
