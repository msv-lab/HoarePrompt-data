Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the minimum value `a` from the list `l`.
2. It then generates a new list `li` where each element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for each combination of `k` and `h` in the range of 0 to `n-1`. This is done to ensure that the elements in `li` match the expected progressive square pattern.
3. After generating `li`, both `l` and `li` are sorted.
4. The function checks if the sorted list `l` is equal to the sorted list `li`. If they are equal, it means the elements in `l` can form a progressive square with the given `c` and `d`, and thus returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.
5. The logic in the function matches the problem description and the expected behavior for determining if the elements in `l` can form a progressive square.

Given the above analysis, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
