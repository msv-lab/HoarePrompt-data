### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly verifies if the given array `l` can form a progressive square.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly parses the input values for `n`, `c`, `d`, and the list `l`.

2. **Generating Expected Values:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the expected values for a progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h`.
   - Here, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`.
   - The nested loops iterate over all possible positions `(k, h)` in the n x n grid to generate the expected values.

3. **Sorting:**
   - Both the generated list `li` and the input list `l` are sorted.

4. **Comparison:**
   - The program checks if the sorted lists `l` and `li` are equal.
   - If they are equal, it returns 'yes', indicating that the input array can form a progressive square.
   - Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

#### Key Points to Consider:

- **Duplicate Values:** The program does not explicitly handle duplicate values. However, since the problem guarantees that there is exactly one progressive square for given `n`, `c`, and `d`, the input array `l` must contain exactly the expected values without duplicates. Therefore, sorting and comparing the lists should work correctly.

- **Correctness of the Approach:**
  - The approach of generating the expected values and comparing them with the sorted input array is logically sound. Given the constraints and guarantees of the problem, this method ensures that the input array contains exactly the expected values.

- **Test Cases:**
  - The annotated code and the provided examples confirm that the program behaves as expected for the given test cases. The program correctly identifies when the input array can form a progressive square and when it cannot.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to verify if the given array `l` can form a progressive square. The original assessment was overly critical and did not fully consider the problem constraints and guarantees.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
