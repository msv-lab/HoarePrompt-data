Output State: `idx` is 1, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at positions `i, i+k, i+2k, ..., i+(m-1)k` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `k-1`) are filled with values starting from 1 up to `k`, and `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `k`.

Explanation: The loop iterates `k` times. In each iteration `i`, it starts filling the `permutation` list at index `i` and increments by `k` each time, setting the values from `curr_v` which starts at 1 and increments by 1 for each assignment. Since `k` is even and `2 ≤ k ≤ n`, the loop will fill out segments of the `permutation` list with consecutive integers starting from 1 up to `k`.
