Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(k)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts (as `range(k)` generates values from 0 to k-1).
   - `k` is given as an input from the user, with the constraints \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(k\) is even.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, it needs to be set to 0.
   - `k` should be set according to its constraints but since we don't know the exact value of `k`, we just need to ensure it meets the condition \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(k\) is even.

4. **Other variables in the state**:
   - `idx`, `n`, `k`, `permutation`, `idx_v`, and `curr_v` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `k`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `k` must satisfy \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(k\) is even**
