Output State: **`idx` is 0, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, k is even, and n - k + 1 ≥ 1; `permutation` is a list of n zeros.**

Explanation: The line `idx = 0` initializes the variable `idx` to 0. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `permutation`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
