Output State: **`idx` is 1, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at positions `i`, `i+k`, `i+2*k`, ..., `i+(m-1)*k` are set to values from `1` to `k` in ascending order, and the rest of the elements are `0`, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `k`, `result` is a string representing the permutation list with elements separated by spaces.**

Explanation: The code snippet `result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])` creates a new string `result` by joining the string representations of each element in the `permutation` list with a space in between. This operation does not change the values of the existing variables (`idx`, `n`, `k`, `permutation`, `idx_v`, `curr_v`). Therefore, the output state retains the values of these variables as they were in the initial state, and adds the new variable `result` with its computed value.
