Output State: **`idx` is 1, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, k is even, and n - k + 1 ≥ 1; `permutation` is a list of n zeros, `idx_v` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `idx_v = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `idx_v`. The values of `idx`, `n`, `k`, and the `permutation` list remain unchanged from their initial state.
