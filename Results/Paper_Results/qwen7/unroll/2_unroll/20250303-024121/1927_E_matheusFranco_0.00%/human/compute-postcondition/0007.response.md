Output State: `idx` is 1, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at positions `i`, `i+k`, `i+2*k`, ..., `i+(m-1)*k` (where `m` is the largest integer such that `i+(m-1)*k < n`) are set to values from `1` to `k` in ascending order, and the rest of the elements are `0`, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `k`.
