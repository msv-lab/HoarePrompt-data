The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from user input, ensuring that `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5`, `k` is even, and `n - k + 1 ≥ 1`. It then constructs a list `permutation` of length `n`, setting elements at positions `i`, `i+k`, `i+2*k`, ..., `i+(m-1)*k` (where `m` is the largest integer such that `i+(m-1)*k < n`) to values from `1` to `k` in ascending order, with the rest of the elements remaining `0`. Finally, it prints the space-separated string representation of the `permutation` list.
