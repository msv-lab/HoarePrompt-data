Reasoning:
The provided function does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The current implementation simply counts the occurrences of the median value in the sorted array, which does not necessarily minimize the number of operations needed to increase the median.

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Median**: The code calculates the median index `p` using `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. This is almost correct but should be adjusted to `n // 2` when `n` is even to get the lower median value.

2. **Counting Occurrences of Median**: The code counts how many times the median value appears in the sorted array. This count does not reflect the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median. For instance, if the median is already the maximum value, no operations are needed, but counting occurrences would still return a non-zero value.

3. **No Strategy for Minimizing Operations**: The code does not have any logic to determine the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median. It only checks the frequency of the current median value.

Given these issues, the provided function does not solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
