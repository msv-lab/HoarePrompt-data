Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and we have read the next input which is an integer representing the number of test cases (`t`).**

This means that the variable `t` has been updated to the value of the first input, which is an integer within the specified range. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 remains valid, and now we know that `t` specifically holds the value of the test case count.
