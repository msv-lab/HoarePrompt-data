### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   
2. **Non-Decreasing Check**: It first checks if the array `a` is already non-decreasing by using `all([a[i-1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`. If this condition is true, it prints 'YES' because no operation is needed.

3. **Finding the Split Point**: If the array is not non-decreasing, it looks for the first position `i` where `a[i-1] > a[i]`. This indicates a potential split point.

4. **Split and Check**: After finding such a split point, it splits the array into two parts: `x` (the prefix from index 0 to `i-1`) and `y` (the suffix from index `i` to the end). It then checks two conditions:
   - `check_all_new`: Ensures that the first element of the original array (`a[0]`) is greater than or equal to the first element of the suffix (`new[0]`).
   - `new_all`: Ensures that the suffix `new` is non-decreasing.

5. **Decision Making**: If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES' because the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping the two parts. If either condition fails, it prints 'NO'.

### Analysis:

- **Initial Check**: The initial check correctly determines if the array is already non-decreasing.
  
- **Finding the Split Point**: The logic for finding the first split point where `a[i-1] > a[i]` is correct. However, the implementation assumes that the array can only be split at one point, which is not necessarily true. The problem allows for multiple possible splits.

- **Split and Check**: The logic for checking if the suffix can be non-decreasing and if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to the first element of the suffix is correct. However, the current implementation only checks the first split point and does not consider other possible splits.

### Example Counter-Case:

Consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`.

- The initial check will fail since the array is not non-decreasing.
- The first split point found is at index 3 (where `a[2] = 3` and `a[3] = 2`).
- The suffix is `[2, 1]`.
- `check_all_new` will be `False` because `a[0] = 1` is not greater than or equal to `new[0] = 2`.
- The function will print 'NO'.

However, the array can actually be made non-decreasing by splitting at index 2 (where `a[1] = 2` and `a[2] = 3`) and swapping the parts. The new array would be `[3, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, which is still not non-decreasing, but it shows that the current implementation might miss valid splits.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly handle all possible splits and thus may incorrectly determine that an array cannot be made non-decreasing when it can.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
**False**
