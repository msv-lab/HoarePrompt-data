You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

    #State: Output State: The output state depends on the input values of `t`, `n`, and `a` for each iteration of the loop. For each `t` iterations, the program checks if the list `a` is non-decreasing. If it is, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it checks if there exists a subsequence starting from any index that is non-decreasing and its first element is greater than or equal to the rest of the elements in the subsequence. If such a subsequence exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
    #
    #Since the exact input values are not provided, the output state cannot be precisely determined without knowing the specific values of `t`, `n`, and `a` for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the possibility of splitting the array in such a way that the resulting array becomes non-decreasing. Let's analyze the given example from the problem statement:

For the input:
```
6
1 1 4 5 1 4
```

The program checks if the array is already non-decreasing:
```
check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])
```
This condition returns `False` because `1 1 4 5 1 4` is not non-decreasing.

Next, the program attempts to split the array and check if the resulting array is non-decreasing:
```
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all_new and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break
```

However, this logic is flawed. The condition `check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])` checks if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to each element in the new part of the array, which is not what we need. Instead, we need to check if the new array formed by swapping the parts is non-decreasing.

A correct approach would be to check if the array can be split such that the first part is non-increasing and the second part is non-decreasing. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the array is already non-decreasing
        if all(a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)):
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        # Try to find a valid split
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                left_part = a[:i]
                right_part = a[i:]
                
                # Check if left_part is non-increasing and right_part is non-decreasing
                if all(left_part[j] >= left_part[j + 1] for j in range(len(left_part) - 1)) and \
                   all(right_part[j] <= right_part[j + 1] for j in range(len(right_part) - 1)):
                    print('YES')
                    break
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version properly checks if the array can be split into two parts such that the first part is non-increasing and the second part is non-decreasing, which aligns with the problem description.
