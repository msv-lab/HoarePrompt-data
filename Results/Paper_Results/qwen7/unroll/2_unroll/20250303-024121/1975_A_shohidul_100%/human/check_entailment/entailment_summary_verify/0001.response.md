### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check**: The function correctly checks if the entire array is already non-decreasing using `all([a[i-1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`. If this condition is true, it prints 'YES', which is correct.

2. **Finding the Split Point**: The function correctly identifies the first position `i` where `a[i-1] > a[i]`. However, this approach might miss some valid cases where the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting at a different point.

3. **Split and Check**: After finding the split point, the function checks if the suffix `new` is non-decreasing and if the first element of the original array (`a[0]`) is greater than or equal to the first element of the suffix (`new[0]`). This is a necessary but not sufficient condition to ensure the array can be made non-decreasing.

4. **Decision Making**: The function prints 'NO' if either of the conditions fails. However, this decision might be too strict. There could be cases where the array can still be made non-decreasing even if the first element of the original array is not greater than or equal to the first element of the suffix.

To illustrate, consider the array `[1, 3, 2, 4]`. The function would identify the split point at index 2 (where `a[1] > a[2]`). The suffix `[2, 4]` is non-decreasing, but the first element of the original array (`1`) is not greater than or equal to the first element of the suffix (`2`). Therefore, the function would print 'NO'. However, the array can actually be made non-decreasing by splitting at index 1 (where `a[0] < a[1]`), resulting in `[3, 2, 1, 4]`.

### Analysis:
- The logic correctly identifies when the array is already non-decreasing.
- It correctly finds the first split point where the array is not non-decreasing.
- The check for the suffix being non-decreasing and the first element of the original array being greater than or equal to the first element of the suffix is necessary but not sufficient.
- The function might incorrectly print 'NO' in some cases where the array can still be made non-decreasing.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts. It might incorrectly print 'NO' in some valid cases.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
