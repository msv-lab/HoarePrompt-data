### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Non-Decreasing Check**: It first checks if the array `a` is already non-decreasing by using `all([a[i-1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`. If this condition is true, it prints 'YES' because no operation is needed.

3. **Finding the Split Point**: If the array is not non-decreasing, it looks for the first position `i` where `a[i-1] > a[i]`. This indicates a potential split point.

4. **Split and Check**: After finding such a split point, it splits the array into two parts: `x` (the prefix from index 0 to `i-1`) and `y` (the suffix from index `i` to the end). It then checks two conditions:
   - `check_all_new`: Ensures that the first element of the original array (`a[0]`) is greater than or equal to the first element of the suffix (`new[0]`).
   - `new_all`: Ensures that the suffix `new` is non-decreasing.

5. **Decision Making**: If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES' because the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping the two parts. If either condition fails, it prints 'NO'.

### Analysis:

- **Initial Check**: The initial check correctly determines if the array is already non-decreasing.
  
- **Finding the Split Point**: The logic correctly identifies the first position `i` where the array is not non-decreasing.

- **Split and Check**:
  - The condition `check_all_new` should ensure that the first element of the original array (`a[0]`) is greater than or equal to the first element of the suffix (`new[0]`). However, the current implementation incorrectly uses `a[0] >= new[i]` instead of `a[0] >= new[0]`.
  - The condition `new_all` correctly checks if the suffix `new` is non-decreasing.

### Example to Illustrate the Error:

Consider the array `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`:
- The initial check fails since the array is not non-decreasing.
- The split point is found at index 2 (where `7 > 2`).
- The suffix `new` is `[2, 2, 3]`.
- `check_all_new` checks `a[0] >= new[2]`, which is `7 >= 3`, which is true.
- `new_all` checks if `[2, 2, 3]` is non-decreasing, which is true.
- Therefore, the program incorrectly prints 'YES'.

### Corrected Implementation:

To fix the error, the condition `check_all_new` should be corrected to:
```python
check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])
```

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])
        
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])
                    new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])
                    if check_all_new and new_all:
                        print('YES')
                        break
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                        break
```

### Conclusion:

The original assessment was **inaccurate** due to the incorrect condition in `check_all_new`. The corrected implementation ensures that the program correctly determines if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
