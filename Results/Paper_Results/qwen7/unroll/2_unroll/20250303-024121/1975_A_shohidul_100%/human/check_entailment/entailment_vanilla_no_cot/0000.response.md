Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that prevent it from correctly determining whether the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts:

1. **Incorrect Check for Non-Decreasing Order**: The initial check `check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])` is used to see if the array is already non-decreasing. However, this check is not sufficient because it does not account for the possibility of rearranging parts of the array.

2. **Logic for Splitting and Swapping**: The logic for checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping is flawed. Specifically, the inner loop where the array is split and checked does not correctly simulate the required operation. It only checks if the prefix (the part after the split) is non-decreasing and if the entire array starting from the first element is greater than or equal to the new prefix. This is not a complete check for the required condition.

3. **Break Statements**: The use of `break` statements inside the loops means that once a condition is met, the function immediately prints 'YES' or 'NO' without considering further possibilities.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the array is already non-decreasing
        if all(a[i-1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)):
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        # Try splitting the array at different positions and check if it can be made non-decreasing
        for i in range(1, n):
            left_part = a[:i]
            right_part = a[i:]
            
            # Check if the right part is non-decreasing
            if all(right_part[j-1] <= right_part[j] for j in range(1, len(right_part))):
                # Check if the left part is greater than or equal to the first element of the right part
                if all(left_part[k] >= right_part[0] for k in range(len(left_part))):
                    print('YES')
                    break
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the array is checked for being non-decreasing and attempts to split and swap parts of the array to see if it can achieve a non-decreasing order.
