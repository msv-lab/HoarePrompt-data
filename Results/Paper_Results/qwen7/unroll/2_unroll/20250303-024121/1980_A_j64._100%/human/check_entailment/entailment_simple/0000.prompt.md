Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    print(func_1(n, m, a))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, and a is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.
def func_1(n, m, a):
    count = [0] * 7
    for char in a:
        count[ord(char) - ord('A')] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `count` is a list of 7 integers representing the frequency of each character ('A' to 'G') in the string `a`. The values in `count` correspond to the number of times each character appears in `a`. `n` is the length of the string `a`, and `m` remains unchanged.
    needed_problems = 0
    for i in range(7):
        if count[i] < m:
            needed_problems += m - count[i]
        
    #State: Output State: count is a list of 7 integers where each integer is at least m, needed_problems is the total number of additional problems needed to make each character count at least m.
    return needed_problems
    #The program returns needed_problems which is the total number of additional problems needed to make each character count in the list 'count' at least m.
