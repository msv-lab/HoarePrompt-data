Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'A' and 'B' printed based on the input strings provided within the range specified by the user. For each string input, if the number of 'A's is greater than the number of 'B's, 'A' is printed; otherwise, 'B' is printed. The total number of 'A' and 'B' printed will depend on the user's input during the execution of the loop.
