Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a positive integer `t` (the number of test cases), and for each test case, two integers `n` and `k`. It calculates and outputs a list `ans` containing specific values derived from `k`. The list includes `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and powers of 2 up to 2^19. Here, `i` is determined such that `1 << i + 1` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. For each test case, it prints the length of the list `ans` followed by its elements.**
