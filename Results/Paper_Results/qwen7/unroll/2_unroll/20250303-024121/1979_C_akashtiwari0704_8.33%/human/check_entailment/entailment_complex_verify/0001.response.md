### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute coins among \(n\) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome \(i\), if it wins, we get \(k_i \times \text{bet}_i\) coins back.
   - The goal is to find a distribution of bets \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) such that \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \times x_i\) for all \(i\).

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution calculates the product of all multipliers \(a_i\) and then divides this product by each individual multiplier to get the corresponding bet value.
   - It then sums up these bet values and checks if the sum is greater than or equal to the product. If it is, it prints `-1`, indicating no valid distribution exists.
   - If the sum is less than the product, it prints the calculated bet values.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - Let's consider the logic:
     - If the product of all multipliers is \(P = a_1 \times a_2 \times \cdots \times a_n\).
     - The bet for the \(i\)-th outcome is \(b_i = \frac{P}{a_i}\).
     - The total bet is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_i = P \left( \frac{1}{a_1} + \frac{1}{a_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{a_n} \right)\).
     - For the solution to work, we need \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_i < P\).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all multipliers are the same, say \(k\), then \(P = k^n\) and \(b_i = \frac{k^n}{k} = k^{n-1}\). The sum of bets would be \(n \times k^{n-1}\), which is always less than \(k^n\) for \(k > 1\).
   - If the multipliers are different, the sum of the reciprocals of the multipliers should be checked against 1. If the sum is greater than or equal to 1, then the total bet would not be less than the product.

5. **Validation:**
   - The solution correctly handles the edge case where the sum of the reciprocals is greater than or equal to 1, ensuring that the total bet is not less than the product.
   - The solution also correctly prints `-1` when no valid distribution exists and prints the bets otherwise.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic. The solution assumes that the sum of the reciprocals of the multipliers is the only factor to check. This is not sufficient because the sum of the bets \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} b_i \) must be strictly less than \(P\), not just less than or equal to \(P\). 

Consider the following example:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  2 3 4
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  -1
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  12 8 6 
  ```

In this case, the sum of the bets is \(12 + 8 + 6 = 26\), which is less than the product \(2 \times 3 \times 4 = 24\), but the solution incorrectly prints the bets instead of `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The given solution is incorrect because it does not ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the product. It only checks if the sum is less than or equal to the product, which is insufficient.

**Correctness: **False**

### Final:
Final: **False**
