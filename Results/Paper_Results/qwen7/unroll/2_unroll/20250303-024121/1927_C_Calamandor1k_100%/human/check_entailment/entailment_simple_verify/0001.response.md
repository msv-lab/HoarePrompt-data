### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires checking if it's possible to select exactly \( \frac{k}{2} \) elements from each of two arrays such that all integers from 1 to \( k \) are included among the selected elements.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one individually.
   - For each test case, it extracts the necessary parameters and elements from the arrays.
   - It then creates sets of unique elements from both arrays that are less than or equal to \( k \).
   - It calculates the number of elements that are unique to each array and the number of common elements between the two arrays.
   - It checks several conditions:
     - If the number of unique elements in either array exceeds \( \frac{k}{2} \), it returns 'NO'.
     - If the total number of distinct elements (unique to each array plus common elements) is less than \( k \), it returns 'NO'.
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it returns 'YES'.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints ensure that the solution approach is feasible within the given limits.
   - The logic correctly handles the requirement of selecting exactly \( \frac{k}{2} \) elements from each array while ensuring all numbers from 1 to \( k \) are included.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - Let's analyze the conditions more closely:
     - **Condition 1**: `if len(only_a) > k // 2:` This condition checks if the number of unique elements in `a` that are not in `b` exceeds \( \frac{k}{2} \). If so, it means there are too many unique elements in `a` to satisfy the requirement.
     - **Condition 2**: `if len(only_b) > k // 2:` This condition checks if the number of unique elements in `b` that are not in `a` exceeds \( \frac{k}{2} \). If so, it means there are too many unique elements in `b` to satisfy the requirement.
     - **Condition 3**: `if total_distinct < k:` This condition checks if the total number of distinct elements (unique to `a`, unique to `b`, and common to both) is less than \( k \). If so, it means there are not enough distinct elements to satisfy the requirement.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program at key points.
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound and aligns with the problem statement.

6. **Test Case Evaluation**:
   - The provided examples in the annotated code and the original assessment are correctly handled by the program.
   - The program correctly identifies when it is possible to select the required elements and when it is not.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description. The conditions and logic in the program are sound and handle all edge cases appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct.
