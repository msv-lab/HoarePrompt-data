### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if it is possible to choose exactly \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from each of two arrays such that all integers from 1 to \(k\) are included among the chosen elements.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one individually.
   - For each test case, it extracts the necessary parameters and elements from the arrays.
   - It then creates sets of unique elements from both arrays that are less than or equal to \(k\).
   - It calculates the number of elements that are unique to each array and the number of common elements between the two arrays.
   - It checks several conditions:
     - If the number of unique elements in either array exceeds \(\frac{k}{2}\), it returns 'NO'.
     - If the total number of distinct elements (unique to each array plus common elements) is less than \(k\), it returns 'NO'.
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it returns 'YES'.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints ensure that the solution approach is feasible within the given limits.
   - The logic correctly handles the requirement of selecting exactly \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from each array while ensuring all numbers from 1 to \(k\) are included.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - Let's verify the logic step-by-step using the provided examples and the function summary.

#### Example 1:
- Input:
  ```
  6
  6 5 6
  2 3 8 5 6 5
  1 3 4 10 5
  6 5 6
  2 3 4 5 6 5
  1 3 8 10 3
  3 3 4
  1 3 5
  2 4 6
  2 5 4
  1 4
  7 3 4 4 2
  1 4 2
  2
  6 4 4 2
  1 5 2
  3
  2 2 1 4 3
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  YES
  NO
  YES
  YES
  NO
  NO
  ```

#### Step-by-Step Verification:
1. **Test Case 1**:
   - \(n = 6\), \(m = 5\), \(k = 6\)
   - \(a = [2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 5]\)
   - \(b = [1, 3, 4, 10, 5]\)
   - Unique elements in \(a \cap [1, 6]\): \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}
   - Unique elements in \(b \cap [1, 6]\): \{1, 3, 4, 5\}
   - Elements unique to \(a\): \{2, 6\}
   - Elements unique to \(b\): \{4\}
   - Common elements: \{1, 3, 5\}
   - Total distinct elements: \(2 + 1 + 3 = 6\)
   - Since the total distinct elements are equal to \(k\), the result is 'YES'.

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - \(n = 6\), \(m = 5\), \(k = 6\)
   - \(a = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5]\)
   - \(b = [1, 3, 8, 10, 3]\)
   - Unique elements in \(a \cap [1, 6]\): \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}
   - Unique elements in \(b \cap [1, 6]\): \{1, 3\}
   - Elements unique to \(a\): \{2, 4, 5, 6\}
   - Elements unique to \(b\): \{3\}
   - Common elements: \{1\}
   - Total distinct elements: \(4 + 1 + 1 = 6\)
   - Since the total distinct elements are equal to \(k\), but the number of unique elements in \(a\) exceeds \(\frac{k}{2}\), the result is 'NO'.

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - \(n = 3\), \(m = 3\), \(k = 4\)
   - \(a = [1, 3, 5]\)
   - \(b = [2, 4, 6]\)
   - Unique elements in \(a \cap [1, 4]\): \{1, 3\}
   - Unique elements in \(b \cap [1, 4]\): \{2, 4\}
   - Elements unique to \(a\): \{1, 3\}
   - Elements unique to \(b\): \{2, 4\}
   - Common elements: \(\emptyset\)
   - Total distinct elements: \(2 + 2 + 0 = 4\)
   - Since the total distinct elements are equal to \(k\), the result is 'YES'.

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - \(n = 2\), \(m = 5\), \(k = 4\)
   - \(a = [1, 4]\)
   - \(b = [1, 4, 2, 5, 3]\)
   - Unique elements in \(a \cap [1, 4]\): \{1, 4\}
   - Unique elements in \(b \cap [1, 4]\): \{1, 2, 3, 4\}
   - Elements unique to \(a\): \{4\}
   - Elements unique to \(b\): \{2, 3\}
   - Common elements: \{1, 4\}
   - Total distinct elements: \(1 + 2 + 2 = 5\)
   - Since the total distinct elements are greater than \(k\), the result is 'YES'.

5. **Test Case 5**:
   - \(n = 1\), \(m = 4\), \(k = 4\)
   - \(a = [7]\)
   - \(b = [1, 4, 2, 5]\)
   - Unique elements in \(a \cap [1, 4]\): \(\emptyset\)
   - Unique elements in \(b \cap [1, 4]\): \{1, 2, 4\}
   - Elements unique to \(a\): \(\emptyset\)
   - Elements unique to \(b\): \{1, 2, 4\}
   - Common elements: \(\emptyset\)
   - Total distinct elements: \(0 + 3 + 0 = 3\)
   - Since the total distinct elements are less than \(k\), the result is 'NO'.

6. **Test Case 6**:
   - \(n = 3\), \(m = 3\), \(k = 3\)
   - \(a = [2, 2, 1]\)
   - \(b = [4, 3, 3]\)
   - Unique elements in \(a \cap [1, 3]\): \{1, 2\}
   - Unique elements in \(b \cap [1, 3]\): \{3, 4\}
   - Elements unique to \(a\): \{1, 2\}
   - Elements unique to \(b\): \{3, 4\}
   - Common elements: \(\emptyset\)
   - Total distinct elements: \(2 + 2 + 0 = 4\)
   - Since the total distinct elements are greater than \(k\), the result is 'NO'.
