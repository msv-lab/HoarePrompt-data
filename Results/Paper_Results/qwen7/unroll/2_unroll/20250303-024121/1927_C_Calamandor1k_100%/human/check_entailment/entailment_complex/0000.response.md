Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to choose exactly \( \frac{k}{2} \) elements from both arrays such that every integer from 1 to \( k \) is included among the chosen elements. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Processing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and for each test case, it reads the lengths of arrays `a` and `b` (`n` and `m`), and the value of `k`.

2. **Set Operations**: For each test case, it creates sets of unique elements from arrays `a` and `b` that are within the range up to `k`. This ensures that only relevant elements are considered.

3. **Exclusive and Common Elements**: It then calculates the elements that are exclusive to `a` (`only_a`), exclusive to `b` (`only_b`), and common to both (`both`). These sets help in determining if the required condition can be satisfied.

4. **Condition Checking**: 
   - If the number of elements in `only_a` or `only_b` exceeds \( \frac{k}{2} \), it means it's impossible to choose exactly \( \frac{k}{2} \) elements from each array without exceeding the limit, so 'NO' is appended.
   - If the total number of distinct elements in `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` is less than \( k \), it also means the condition cannot be satisfied, so 'NO' is appended.
   - Otherwise, 'YES' is appended.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions checked.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program correctly checks the conditions specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
