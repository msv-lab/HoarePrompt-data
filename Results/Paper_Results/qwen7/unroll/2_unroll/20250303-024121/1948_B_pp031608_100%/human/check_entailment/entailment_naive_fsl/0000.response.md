Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program checks if the current element is less than the previous element and splits the previous element accordingly. However, it does not ensure that after splitting, the resulting array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Consider the following test case:
```
4
12 3 45 67
```
- The initial array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`.
- The program checks if `67` is less than `45`, which is false, so it moves to the next pair.
- It then checks if `45` is less than `3`. Since `45 > 3`, it splits `45` into `[4, 5]` and inserts them in place, resulting in `[12, 3, 4, 5, 67]`.

However, the program does not check if the resulting array is sorted. After splitting `45` into `[4, 5]`, the array becomes `[12, 3, 4, 5, 67]`, which is not sorted. Therefore, the program incorrectly prints "YES" for this case.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that after each split, the array remains sorted. This requires additional logic to verify the sorted order after each modification.
