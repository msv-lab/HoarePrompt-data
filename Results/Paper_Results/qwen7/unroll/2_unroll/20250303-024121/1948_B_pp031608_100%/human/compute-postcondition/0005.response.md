Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) (2 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 50) followed by \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) (0 ≤ \( a_i \) ≤ 99). For each test case, it checks if rearranging any adjacent pair of elements can make the sequence non-decreasing. If such a rearrangement is possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function implicitly uses the value of \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^3) from the input structure but does not return it.**
