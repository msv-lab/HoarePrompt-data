Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array itself.
   
2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates over the array from the end to the beginning.
   - For each pair of adjacent elements, it checks if the current element (`arr[i]`) is less than the previous element (`arr[i-1]`).
   - If `arr[i] < arr[i-1]`, it splits `arr[i-1]` into its individual digits and appends `arr[i]` to the list of digits.
   - It then checks if the resulting list of digits is sorted.
   - If the list of digits is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it updates `arr[i-1]` with the first digit of the sorted list.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements, it prints "NO" if `ans` is `False`, otherwise it prints "YES".

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting and Sorting:**
   - The logic for checking if the digits of `arr[i-1]` plus `arr[i]` can be sorted is flawed.
   - The program assumes that splitting `arr[i-1]` and appending `arr[i]` will always result in a sorted sequence, which is not necessarily true.
   - For example, consider the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. The program would split `45` into `[4, 5]` and append `67`, but this does not guarantee that the resulting sequence will be sorted.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Digits:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the splitting and reinsertion of digits.
   - It only checks if the combined list of digits is sorted, but it does not ensure that the original array can be transformed into a sorted array through the allowed operations.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
