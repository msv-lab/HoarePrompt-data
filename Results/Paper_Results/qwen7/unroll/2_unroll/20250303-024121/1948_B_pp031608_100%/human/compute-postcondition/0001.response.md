Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(n):`. The only variable involved here is `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `n`**: The problem states that `n` is an input integer such that `2 <= n <= 50`.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. Given the constraint `2 <= n <= 50`, `n` will always be greater than or equal to 1.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since `n` must be within the specified range for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is set to a value within this range.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `n` being within the range `2 <= n <= 50`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` must be an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50**
