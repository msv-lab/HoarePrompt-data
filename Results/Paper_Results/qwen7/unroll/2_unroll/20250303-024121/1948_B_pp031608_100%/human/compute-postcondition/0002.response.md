Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and for each iteration of the outer loop, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, and `ans` is a boolean value indicating whether a certain condition is met after processing the list `arr`. After all iterations of the loop, the final value of `ans` is printed for each input, determining if the condition was met or not.
