Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but reads from standard input a number of test cases (t), and for each test case, it reads the number of coins (n) and a string (s) consisting of "U" and "D". It then returns a list named 'cases' containing tuples, where each tuple includes the values of 'n' and 's' for each test case.**
