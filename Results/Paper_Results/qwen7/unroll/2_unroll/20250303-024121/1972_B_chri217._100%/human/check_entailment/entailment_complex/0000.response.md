Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the initial configuration of coins. The game rules dictate that players remove a facing-up coin and flip its adjacent coins. The game ends when no more facing-up coins are available, and the player unable to make a move loses.
- `func_1()` correctly reads the input and constructs a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the number of coins (`n`) and the initial state of the coins (`s`).
- `func_2()` calculates the number of coins facing up and determines the winner based on whether this count is even or odd. According to the game rules, if the number of coins facing up is even, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
- Given the example provided, `func_2()` produces the correct results for the sample inputs:
  - For "UUDUD", the count of "U" is 3 (odd), so Bob wins ("NO").
  - For "UDDUD", the count of "U" is 2 (even), so Alice wins ("YES").
  - For "UU", the count of "U" is 2 (even), so Alice wins ("NO").

Since both functions correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner based on the initial configuration of the coins, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
