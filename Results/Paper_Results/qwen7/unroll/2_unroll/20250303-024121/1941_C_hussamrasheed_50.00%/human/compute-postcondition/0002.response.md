Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers, each representing the sum of the counts of the substrings "map" and "pie" for each input string `s` across all iterations of the loop. Specifically, for each input integer `t`, the loop will process `t` strings, counting occurrences of "map" and "pie" in each string, then printing the sum of these counts for that string.
