Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the input string `s`. It then removes all occurrences of "map" from the string and calculates the count of "pie" again. Finally, it prints the sum of these two counts, which should represent the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

However, this approach is flawed because:

1. **Counting Substrings**: The count of "pie" after removing "map" does not necessarily give the minimum deletions required to make the string beautiful. For example, consider the string "mappie". After removing "map", we get "pie", but the original "pie" still needs to be removed, requiring 3 deletions instead of just 2.

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic fails to account for overlapping substrings and the correct way to minimize deletions. For instance, in the string "ppiee", the program would incorrectly calculate the deletions needed.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
