Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and then prints their sum. However, this approach is flawed because:

1. **Substrings Overlap**: The program does not account for overlapping substrings. For example, in the string "mappie", both "map" and "pie" are present, but the program would count them separately even though they overlap.

2. **Minimum Deletions**: The goal is to find the minimum number of deletions required to remove all instances of "map" and "pie". Simply counting the occurrences does not provide the minimum deletions needed.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate through the string and remove characters to eliminate the substrings "map" and "pie" in an optimal way. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        i = 0
        deletions = 0
        
        while i < len(s):
            if i + 2 < len(s) and s[i:i+3] == 'map':
                deletions += 1
                i += 3  # Skip the next 3 characters
            elif i + 2 < len(s) and s[i:i+3] == 'pie':
                deletions += 1
                i += 3  # Skip the next 3 characters
            else:
                i += 1
        
        print(deletions)

func()
```

This corrected program iterates through the string and removes the minimum number of characters to eliminate all occurrences of "map" and "pie".
