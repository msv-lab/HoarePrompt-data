Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `num2` and a list of integers `a`. For each test case, if `num2` is greater than 10000, it prints 1 and 16668 then breaks. Otherwise, it calculates the median of the sorted list `a` and performs an operation to increment elements until a new median is found, counting the number of operations needed. The function outputs the total number of operations for each valid test case.**
