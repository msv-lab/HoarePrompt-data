### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the provided code is correct. However, upon closer inspection, we need to verify if the dynamic programming approach in `func_1` accurately counts the number of valid sequences that can produce the given sorted prefix sums.

#### Detailed Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**: The DP array `dp` is initialized to zero, and `dp[n]` is set to 1, indicating one way to start with an empty prefix sum at the midpoint.
   - **Dynamic Programming Transition**: The transitions `dp[j + 1]` and `dp[j - 1]` are updated based on the current value of `dp[j]`. This simulates adding either `1` or `-1` to the current prefix sum.
   - **Final Sum Calculation**: The final sum is calculated as `p[-1] + n`, which corresponds to the last element in the sorted prefix sum array plus the midpoint.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input Reading**: Reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits the input into tokens.
   - **Processing Test Cases**: Iterates over each test case, extracts `n` and the prefix sum array `p`, and calls `func_1` to get the result for each test case.
   - **Output**: Prints the results for each test case.

### Verification Against Problem Description

1. **Problem Constraints**:
   - The constraints are handled correctly, including the modulo operation (`998244353`).

2. **Correctness of DP Transition**:
   - The DP transition logic in `func_1` is designed to count the number of valid sequences that can produce the given sorted prefix sums.
   - However, the transitions `dp[j + 1]` and `dp[j - 1]` do not correctly simulate the prefix sum generation process. Specifically, the transitions should only add `1` or `-1` to the current prefix sum, but the implementation does not ensure that the resulting prefix sums are valid (i.e., they must be between `-n` and `n`).

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and outputs the results.

### Example Counterexample

Consider the following example:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  -1 0 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  0
  ```

Explanation:
- The valid sequences that can produce the prefix sums `[-1, 0, 1]` are `[1, -1, 1]` and `[-1, 1, 1]`.
- However, the provided code incorrectly returns `0` because it does not correctly handle the transitions and constraints of the prefix sums.

### Conclusion

The original assessment was inaccurate because the dynamic programming approach in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the prefix sum generation process, leading to incorrect results.

**Final: False**
