Output State: `index` is 2 + 2t, `t` is t, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[0]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]` for each iteration, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using the split() method, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, no change in the value of `res` since it's only read in the loop and not modified.

In this scenario, the loop simply iterates over the `results` list and prints each element. The variables `index`, `t`, `n`, `p`, `data`, and `results` remain unchanged after the loop completes its execution. The `res` variable is only used within the loop to hold the current element of the `results` list during each iteration but does not affect the overall state outside the loop.
