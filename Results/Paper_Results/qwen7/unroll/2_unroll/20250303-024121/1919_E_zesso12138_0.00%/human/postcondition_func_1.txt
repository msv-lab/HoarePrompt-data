The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the size of the hidden array `n` and a sorted list of integers `p`. It then calls another function `func_1(n, p)` to compute some result based on `n` and `p`. Finally, it prints the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all test cases.
