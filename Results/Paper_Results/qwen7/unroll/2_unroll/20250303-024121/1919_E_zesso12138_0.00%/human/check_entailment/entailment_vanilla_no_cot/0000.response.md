Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect DP Transition:**
   - The `func_1` function uses a dynamic programming approach to count the number of ways to construct the array `a`. However, the transitions in the DP table do not accurately reflect the constraints and properties of the problem.
   - Specifically, the transitions `dp[j + 1]` and `dp[j - 1]` should consider the values of `p` and how they map back to the original array `a`.

2. **Misunderstanding of Prefix Sums and Sorting:**
   - The problem involves constructing an array `a` from the sorted prefix sums `p`. The provided code does not correctly handle the mapping between `p` and `a`.
   - The transitions in the DP table should account for the fact that the prefix sums `p` are sorted, and the original array `a` consists of only `1` and `-1`.

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The code correctly applies the modulo operation (`% MOD`) to handle large numbers, but the logic inside the DP loop is flawed.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to use combinatorial methods and dynamic programming to count the number of valid arrays `a` that can produce the given sorted prefix sums `p`.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
MOD = 998244353

def count_initial_arrays(n, p):
    # Initialize DP table
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1  # Base case: one way to have a prefix sum of 0 with an empty array
    
    # Iterate over each prefix sum in p
    for val in p:
        new_dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if dp[i] > 0:
                # If the current value in p is positive, we can add 1 to the prefix sum
                if val - i >= 0:
                    new_dp[val - i] = (new_dp[val - i] + dp[i]) % MOD
                # If the current value in p is negative, we can subtract 1 from the prefix sum
                if i - val >= 0:
                    new_dp[i - val] = (new_dp[i - val] + dp[i]) % MOD
        dp = new_dp
    
    # The result is the number of ways to get a prefix sum of p[-1]
    return dp[p[-1]]

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = count_initial_arrays(n, p)
        results.append(result)
    for res in results:
        print(res)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

This corrected version uses a more accurate DP approach to count the number of valid initial arrays `a` that can produce the given sorted prefix sums `p`.
