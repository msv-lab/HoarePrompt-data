Output State: `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `check` is 2147483647.

Explanation: The loop processes a series of inputs, updating a dictionary `dic` and calculating `ans`. However, the values of `t` and `check` are not affected by the operations inside the loop. Therefore, their states remain unchanged after all iterations of the loop.
