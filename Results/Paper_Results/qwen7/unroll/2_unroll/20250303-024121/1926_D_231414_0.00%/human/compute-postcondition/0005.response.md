Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of sub-cases, followed by n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) positive integers a_1, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_j < 2^31) where the sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. It returns different outputs based on the values of a_1, ..., a_n for each sub-case.**

This means the function handles a series of test cases, each with its own t and n, and for each sub-case within those test cases, it processes n non-negative integers. However, since the function definition itself does not specify any parameters, the description focuses on the implicit structure of the input and expected behavior.
