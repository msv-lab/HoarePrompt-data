Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires dividing integers into groups such that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit value in any of the 31 least significant bits.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `times`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the list of integers.
   - It uses a dictionary `dic` to keep track of the counts of integers after applying a bitwise XOR operation with `check`, which is \(2^{31} - 1\) (i.e., 31 ones in binary).
   - The key idea is to use the result of the XOR operation to group numbers. If two numbers have different bits in the 31 least significant positions, their XOR will have at least one bit set to 1. By counting these results, the program can determine the minimum number of groups needed.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The program correctly initializes `check` to \(2^{31} - 1\).
   - It iterates through each number, applies the XOR operation, and updates the dictionary accordingly.
   - It prints the current count of groups required (`ans`) after processing each number.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the minimum number of groups required for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like multiple zeros and identical numbers correctly by adjusting the group count.

Given the analysis, the program logic appears to be correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
