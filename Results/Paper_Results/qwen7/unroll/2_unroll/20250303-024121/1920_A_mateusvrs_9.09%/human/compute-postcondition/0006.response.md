Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers that satisfy a set of constraints defined within the function's body. Each constraint is described by two integers (a, x) where a is either 1, 2, or 3, and x is between 1 and 10^9. The function ensures that the returned integers meet all given constraints and that no two constraints are the same.**

Note: The actual implementation details and logic for finding the integers that satisfy the constraints are not included in this description as per the instruction.
