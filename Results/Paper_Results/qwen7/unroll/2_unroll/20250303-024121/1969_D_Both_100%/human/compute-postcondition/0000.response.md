Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `func_1()` has been called.**

Explanation: The code `test_cases = func_1()` assigns the return value of `func_1()` to the variable `test_cases`. Since the function `func_1()` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact return value. However, we know that `test_cases` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The precondition that `test_cases` is a positive integer remains valid, and the function call `func_1()` has been executed.
