### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Handling:**
   - `func_1()` correctly reads and returns the number of test cases (`t`).
   - `func_2()` correctly reads and returns the values of `n` and `k`, and the lists of prices `prices` and bonuses `bonuses`.

2. **Heap and List Initialization:**
   - A min-heap (`heap`) is initialized to keep track of the items Bob will take for free.
   - `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, which helps in sorting the items based on their difference `(b_i - a_i)`.

3. **Sorting and Initial Heap Population:**
   - The combined list of tuples `(neg_prices, bonuses)` is sorted based on the bonus value `b_i`.
   - The first `k` items with the highest bonuses are added to the heap. This ensures that Bob will take the most valuable items for free.

4. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The function `func_3()` calculates the profit for a given list of items and a heap of items Bob will take for free. It sums up the values of items for which `a_i + b_i >= 0`.
   - The main loop iteratively processes the remaining items, adjusting the current profit and updating the heap as necessary.

5. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The algorithm ensures that Bob takes the most valuable items for free, and Alice maximizes her profit by selling the remaining items at their full price.
   - The logic correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, such as when `k` is zero or when there are no items left to process.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate Alice's profit under optimal conditions for both Alice and Bob.

### Correctness:
**True**
