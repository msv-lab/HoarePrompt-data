Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, a list `prices` of `n` positive integers representing the prices for Alice (a_i), and a list `bonuses` of `n` positive integers representing the prices for Bob (b_i). The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given constraints.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each involving specific parameters and lists, but no explicit return value is described in the provided information.
