### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game with `n` items.
   - Each item has two prices: `a_i` for Alice and `b_i` for Bob.
   - Alice wants to maximize her profit, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - If Alice buys fewer than `k` items, Bob can take all of them for free.
   - Otherwise, Bob can take `k` items for free, and Alice must pay for the rest.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - To maximize her profit, Alice should aim to minimize the cost of the items she buys and maximize the revenue from selling to Bob.
   - Bob will try to minimize Alice's profit by choosing the most expensive items for Alice to buy and the least expensive ones for him to take for free.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The provided code uses a min-heap (`heapq`) to manage the items.
   - It sorts the items based on their `b_i - a_i` values (bonuses).
   - For the first `k` items, it pushes them into the heap.
   - Then, it processes the remaining items, adjusting the profit based on whether the item's bonus is positive or negative.

4. **Code Review:**
   - **Function `func_1()`**: Reads the number of test cases.
   - **Function `func_2()`**: Reads multiple space-separated integers.
   - **Function `func_3()`**: Calculates the total profit based on the primary items and the secondary heap.
   - **Function `func_4()`**: Main function that handles the logic for each test case.
     - It reads the number of items `n` and the threshold `k`.
     - It reads the prices `a_i` and `b_i`.
     - It calculates the bonuses `b_i - a_i` and sorts them.
     - It processes the first `k` items and pushes them into the heap.
     - It then processes the remaining items, adjusting the profit accordingly.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic seems to correctly handle the sorting and processing of items.
   - The use of a heap ensures efficient management of the items.
   - The algorithm correctly calculates the maximum profit for Alice by considering the optimal strategy for both players.

### Conclusion:
The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
