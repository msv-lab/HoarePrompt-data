Output State: **The maximum profit obtained from executing the loop for each test case.**

This means that for each test case specified by `test_cases`, the loop calculates the maximum profit based on the operations defined within the loop, and then prints the result. The final output state will be a series of maximum profits corresponding to each test case.
