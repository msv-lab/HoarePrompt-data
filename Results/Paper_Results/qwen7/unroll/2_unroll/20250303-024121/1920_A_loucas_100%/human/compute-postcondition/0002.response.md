Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed as the loop iterates. For each iteration of the outer loop, the program processes `innerLoop` inputs, categorizes them into `big`, `less`, and `no` lists based on the value of `x`, calculates `num` as `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, adjusts `num` based on the presence of elements in `no` that fall within the range `[max(big), min(less)]`, and prints the final value of `num`. This process repeats for each value of `loop` from 1 to the specified `loop` value.
