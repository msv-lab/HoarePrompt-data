Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Removals and Negations**: The logic for handling Alice's removals and Bob's negations is flawed. Specifically, the code does not correctly account for the optimal strategy where Alice removes the smallest elements and Bob negates the smallest remaining elements.

2. **Redundant Calculations**: The code calculates `sum1` and `ans` in a way that doesn't reflect the optimal strategy. It incorrectly assumes that removing elements and negating them can be done in a linear fashion without considering the best possible combination of actions.

3. **Logic for Maximum Sum Calculation**: The logic inside the loop for calculating `sums` is incorrect. It doesn't properly handle the scenario where Alice removes elements and Bob negates others in an optimal manner.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the following:

1. **Alice's Strategy**: Alice should remove the smallest `k` elements to minimize the negative impact on the sum.
2. **Bob's Strategy**: Bob should negate the smallest `x` elements of the remaining array to minimize the sum further.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        # Alice removes the smallest k elements
        a = a[k:]
        
        # Bob negates the smallest x elements
        a[:x] = [-i for i in a[:x]]
        
        # Calculate the final sum
        print(sum(a))

func()
```

This approach ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally according to their respective strategies.
