The function accepts a list of integers `cts`, which represents certain subarray sums of a palindrome array. It processes this list by iterating through its elements and constructs a new list `odds`. This new list contains all elements from the original list `cts`, excluding any duplicate occurrences of the last element present in the `odds` list during the iteration. The function ultimately returns this processed list `odds`.
