Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers representing all but one of the subarray sums of a palindrome array `a` of size `n`, `a` is a list of `n` zeros, `prev` is 0, `idx` is `(n - 1) // 2`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `(n - 1) // 2` to the variable `idx`. This does not affect the values of `odds`, `a`, or `prev`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The new state of `idx` is calculated and included in the output state.
