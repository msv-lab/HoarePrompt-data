Reasoning:
The given program consists of two separate functions and a main block. The first function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` is designed to process directories and files within a specified range, while the second function `func_1` is unrelated to this task and seems to be a separate piece of code that handles a different problem involving binary strings.

The execution summary describes the behavior of `func_1`, which is not the function being tested in the provided code snippet. Therefore, we need to focus only on the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function for correctness evaluation.

The `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function correctly performs the following steps:
1. It gets the current working directory.
2. It lists all subdirectories in the current directory.
3. It filters these subdirectories to find those whose names are numeric and fall within the specified range.
4. For each such subdirectory, it lists all `.html` files.
5. It generates corresponding `.py` files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) for each `.html` file found.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the provided code snippet appears to be correct and performs the intended operations without any errors based on the information provided.

Correctness: **True**
