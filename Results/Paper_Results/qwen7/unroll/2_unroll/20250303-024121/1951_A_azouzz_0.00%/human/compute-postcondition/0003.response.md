Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions specified within the loop body. For each iteration, the value of `n` (read from input) and string `s` (read from input) will determine whether 'YES' or 'NO' is printed. The initial values of `start`, `end`, and `t` will remain unchanged, and the output will reflect the results of the loop's conditions applied to the inputs provided during each iteration.
