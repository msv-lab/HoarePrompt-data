Output State: The number of elements in the list `nums` after processing each test case, followed by the elements themselves. The list `nums` will contain up to 23 unique integers for each test case, which are derived from the value of `k` and some powers of 2. Specifically, the list will include the following elements: \(2^{0}\) to \(2^{20}\), the value of `k`, `k-2^idx`, `k+1`, and `k+2^idx+1`, where `idx` is the index just before the first power of 2 greater than `k`. The exact elements and their count depend on the specific values of `n` and `k` for each test case.
