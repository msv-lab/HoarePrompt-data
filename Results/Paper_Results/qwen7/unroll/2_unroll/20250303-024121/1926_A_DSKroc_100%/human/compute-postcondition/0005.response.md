Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) and a string of length 5 containing 'A' and 'B'. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string. If the count of 'A' is greater than the count of 'B', it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
