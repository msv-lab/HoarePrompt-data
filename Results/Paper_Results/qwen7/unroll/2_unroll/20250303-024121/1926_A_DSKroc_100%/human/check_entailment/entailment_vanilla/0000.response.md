### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Character Counting**: For each string in the test cases, the program counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'.
3. **Comparison Logic**: After counting the occurrences, the program compares the counts of 'A' and 'B'. If 'A' appears more frequently, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'.
4. **Edge Cases**: Since the problem specifies that each string is of length 5 and consists only of 'A' and 'B', the logic should handle all possible combinations correctly.
5. **Output Format**: The program outputs the character that appears most frequently for each test case, which matches the problem requirements.

Given these points, the program appears to be logically sound and should work correctly for the given constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
