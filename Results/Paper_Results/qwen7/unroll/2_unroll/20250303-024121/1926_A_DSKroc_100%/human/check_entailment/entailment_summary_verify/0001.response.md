### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is handled correctly.
2. **Character Counting**: For each string in the test cases, the program counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'. This part is also handled correctly.
3. **Comparison Logic**: After counting the occurrences, the program compares the counts of 'A' and 'B'. If 'A' appears more frequently, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. This logic is correct as well.
4. **Edge Cases**: The problem specifies that each string is of length 5 and consists only of 'A' and 'B'. The program should handle all possible combinations correctly. However, we need to ensure that the logic works for edge cases where the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal. In such cases, the program should print one of the characters (either 'A' or 'B'), but it does not explicitly handle this scenario. The function summary mentions that the function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case, which aligns with the observed behavior.

Given these points, the program appears to be logically sound and should work correctly for the given constraints. The original assessment correctly identifies the logical soundness of the program.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
