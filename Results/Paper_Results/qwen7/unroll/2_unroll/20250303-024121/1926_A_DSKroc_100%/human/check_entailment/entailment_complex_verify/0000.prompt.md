You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    ABABB

    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each test case, the input string is a string of length 5 consisting of the letters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings across all test cases are distinct.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive. For each input string `s` provided in the range of `t`, the output is either 'A' or 'B' based on whether the number of 'A's is greater than the number of 'B's in the string. If the number of 'A's is greater, 'A' is printed; otherwise, 'B' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) and a string of length 5 containing 'A' and 'B'. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string. If the count of 'A' is greater than the count of 'B', it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string and prints the character that appears most frequently. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the program handles all possible cases correctly. Since the string length is fixed at 5 and can only contain 'A' or 'B', the logic to count and compare the frequencies works without any issues. The program processes each test case independently and outputs the correct result for each, meeting the requirements of the problem description.
