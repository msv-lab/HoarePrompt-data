You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

    #State: Output State: `T` is an integer read from stdin and stripped of whitespace, and 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4; `MOD` is 1000000007; For each input pair `(n, k)` and list `a`, the variable `ans` is calculated based on the given operations and summed up modulo `MOD`; After all iterations, `ans` contains the final result for each input, summed up and taken modulo `MOD`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer \( T \) (1 ≤ \( T \) ≤ 10^4), two positive integers \( n \) and \( k \) (1 ≤ \( n \), \( k \) ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the sum of \( n \) and \( k \) for all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers (each integer \( a_i \) satisfies -10^9 ≤ \( a_i \) ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it calculates a value \( ans \) based on the sum of \( a \), the maximum subarray sum starting from any point, and the value of \( k \), then prints the result modulo \( MOD \) (1000000007). The function reads inputs from standard input and outputs results to standard output.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Maximize the sum of the array after performing `k` operations.
2. **Operations**: Each operation allows selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.
3. **Constraints**: 
   - Number of test cases `T` is between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - Array size `n` and number of operations `k` are between 1 and \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - Array elements are between \(-10^9\) and \(10^9\).
4. **Output**: Maximum possible sum modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Provided Solution Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `MOD = 1000000007`: Correctly defined modulo value.
   - `T = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())`: Reads the number of test cases.
   
2. **Loop over Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, reads `n` and `k`.
   - Reads the array `a`.

3. **Calculate Initial Sum and Maximum Prefix Sum**:
   - `s = sum(a)`: Calculates the initial sum of the array.
   - `t, tmp = 0, 0`: Initializes variables for tracking the maximum prefix sum (`t`) and a temporary sum (`tmp`).
   - Iterates through the array to calculate the maximum prefix sum:
     ```python
     for x in a:
         tmp += x
         if tmp < 0:
             tmp = 0
         t = max(tmp, t)
     ```
     This calculates the maximum sum of any prefix of the array (essentially the maximum subarray sum).

4. **Calculate Final Answer**:
   - `ans = ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`: Adds the initial sum and the maximum prefix sum, then takes modulo.
   - For each operation (`k-1` times), doubles the maximum prefix sum and adds it to the answer, taking modulo after each addition:
     ```python
     for i in range(k - 1):
         t *= 2
         t %= MOD
         ans += t
         ans %= MOD
     ```
     This step aims to maximize the sum by repeatedly adding the maximum prefix sum multiple times.

5. **Output the Result**:
   - Prints the result.

### Reasoning:
- The approach correctly identifies the maximum prefix sum of the array.
- Doubling the maximum prefix sum in each operation is a valid strategy to maximize the sum since the sum of the array can be increased by adding the same positive value multiple times.
- Handling the modulo operation correctly ensures the result fits within the required constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations. Therefore, the solution is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
