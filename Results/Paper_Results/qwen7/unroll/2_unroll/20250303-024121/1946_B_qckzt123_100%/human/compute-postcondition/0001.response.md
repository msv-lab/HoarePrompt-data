Output State: **`T` is an integer read from stdin and stripped of whitespace, and 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4; `MOD` is 1000000007.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `T`. The initial state of `T` being a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 is preserved, and `MOD` remains unchanged at 1000000007.
