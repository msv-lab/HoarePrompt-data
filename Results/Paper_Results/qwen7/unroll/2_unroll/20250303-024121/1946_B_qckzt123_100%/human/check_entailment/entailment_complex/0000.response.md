Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations. Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting the sum of that subarray into the array. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after these operations.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The initial sum of the array is `s`.
   - The maximum prefix sum (`t`) is computed, which represents the maximum sum of any subarray starting from the beginning of the array.
   - After the first operation, we can add the maximum prefix sum `t` multiple times, effectively doubling it each time, up to `k-1` times.

3. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - Calculate the initial sum `s` of the array.
   - Compute the maximum prefix sum `t` using Kadane's algorithm.
   - The final answer is derived by adding the initial sum `s` plus the maximum prefix sum `t` multiplied by the number of times it can be doubled within `k` operations, modulo `10^9 + 7`.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.
   - It computes the initial sum `s` and the maximum prefix sum `t`.
   - It then iteratively doubles `t` up to `k-1` times and adds it to the result, ensuring the result is taken modulo `10^9 + 7`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is 0, no operations are performed, so the result should be the initial sum `s` modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   - If the array contains only negative numbers, the maximum prefix sum `t` will be 0, and the result will be the initial sum `s` modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
