Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Array Sum Calculation**: It calculates the initial sum `s` of the array `a`, which is necessary for the final sum calculation.
3. **Subarray Sum Calculation**: It computes the maximum prefix sum `t` of the array `a`. This is done by iterating through the array and maintaining a running sum `tmp` that resets to zero when it becomes negative. This step ensures that we capture the largest contiguous subarray sum.
4. **Final Sum Calculation**: The formula used to calculate the final sum is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`. This accounts for the initial sum of the array plus the maximum prefix sum, adjusted for modulo arithmetic.
5. **K Operations**: The program correctly handles the additional `k-1` operations by doubling the maximum prefix sum `t` for each operation and adding it to the result. This is done modulo `MOD` to handle large numbers.
6. **Output**: The result is printed for each test case, ensuring the output is formatted correctly.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic appears to be sound and correctly implements the required operations to achieve the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations.

Correctness: **True**
