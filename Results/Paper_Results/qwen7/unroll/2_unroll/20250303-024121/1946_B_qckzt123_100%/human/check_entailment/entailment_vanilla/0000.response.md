Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Maximize the sum of the array after performing `k` operations.
2. **Operations**: Each operation allows selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.
3. **Constraints**: 
   - Number of test cases `T` is between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - Array size `n` and number of operations `k` are between 1 and \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - Array elements are between \(-10^9\) and \(10^9\).
4. **Output**: Maximum possible sum modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Provided Solution Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `MOD = 1000000007`: Correctly defined modulo value.
   - `T = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())`: Reads the number of test cases.
   
2. **Loop over Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, reads `n` and `k`.
   - Reads the array `a`.

3. **Calculate Initial Sum and Maximum Prefix Sum**:
   - `s = sum(a)`: Calculates the initial sum of the array.
   - `t, tmp = 0, 0`: Initializes variables for tracking the maximum prefix sum (`t`) and a temporary sum (`tmp`).
   - Iterates through the array to calculate the maximum prefix sum:
     ```python
     for x in a:
         tmp += x
         if tmp < 0:
             tmp = 0
         t = max(tmp, t)
     ```
     This calculates the maximum sum of any prefix of the array (essentially the maximum subarray sum).

4. **Calculate Final Answer**:
   - `ans = ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`: Adds the initial sum and the maximum prefix sum, then takes modulo.
   - For each operation (`k-1` times), doubles the maximum prefix sum and adds it to the answer, taking modulo after each addition:
     ```python
     for i in range(k - 1):
         t *= 2
         t %= MOD
         ans += t
         ans %= MOD
     ```
     This step aims to maximize the sum by repeatedly adding the maximum prefix sum multiple times.

5. **Output the Result**:
   - Prints the result.

### Reasoning:
- The approach correctly identifies the maximum prefix sum of the array.
- Doubling the maximum prefix sum in each operation is a valid strategy to maximize the sum since the sum of the array can be increased by adding the same positive value multiple times.
- Handling the modulo operation correctly ensures the result fits within the required constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations. Therefore, the solution is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
