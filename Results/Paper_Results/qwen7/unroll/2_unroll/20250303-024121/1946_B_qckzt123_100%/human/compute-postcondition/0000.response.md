Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `MOD` is 1000000007.**

Explanation: The code snippet defines a constant `MOD` with the value `1000000007`. This assignment does not affect the value of `t` or any other variables. Therefore, the only changes are to the value of `MOD`, which is now explicitly set to `1000000007`. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged.
