Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes a list of test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the sum of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5), and a list a of n integers (each integer a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, the function returns a result based on the values of t, n, k, and the list a.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters and a list of integers. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case, though the exact nature of the result is not specified in the given information.
