Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop uses `_` as a placeholder, which is typically used when the loop variable is not needed within the loop body.
   - The loop also makes use of `int(input())`, which reads an integer from the input.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, the number of iterations is determined by the user input.
   - The variable `n` (which represents the length of the permutation) is fixed but unknown, and the permutation itself is also fixed but unknown.
   - The loop will run for a number of times equal to the integer input by the user.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the input provided.
   - The state before the loop should reflect that the user will provide an integer input, and this input will determine the number of iterations.

Given these points, the state before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that the user will provide an integer input, and this input will control the number of iterations of the loop.

**State:**
**`n` is an unknown fixed integer, and the user will provide an integer input that determines the number of iterations of the loop.** 

To be more precise in the format requested:

**State: **`n` is an unknown fixed integer, and the user will provide an integer input that determines the number of iterations of the loop.**
