Precondition: **None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the function signature. However, the problem requires the function to interact with an external entity to perform queries and receive responses. The variable n is an integer representing the length of the permutation, and the permutation itself is fixed but unknown. The function must make at most 3n queries to find a pair of indices i and j such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.**
