Reasoning:
- The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases and then processing each test case individually.
- For each test case, the program iterates through the string to count the number of pieces needed. It increments the count whenever there is a change in the character (from '0' to '1' or vice versa).
- If the substring "01" is found in the string, the program adjusts the count by subtracting 1 because this indicates that the string can be split into two parts that can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string.
- The logic for counting pieces and adjusting the count when "01" is found seems to align with the problem's requirements.
- The program prints the result for each test case as required.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
