You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, s is a binary string such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 1
        
        flag = False
        
        j = 0
        
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        
        print(count)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, and for each `i` in the range of `t`, `count` is the number of consecutive characters in the string `s` (input at the `i`-th iteration), minus one if the substring "01" appears anywhere in `s`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `count` is initialized to 1, representing the initial assumption that at least one piece is needed.
   - `flag` is a boolean variable used to track whether a transition from '0' to '1' has been observed.
   - `j` is an index variable starting from 0.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop iterates through the string `s` until the second last character (`len(s) - 1`).
   - If the current character `s[j]` is different from the next character `s[j + 1]`, it increments `count` by 1.
   - If the current character is '0' and the next character is '1', it sets `flag` to `True` and increments `j` by 1 to skip the next character (since we've already counted this transition).

4. **Adjustment Based on Flag:**
   - After the loop, if `flag` is `True`, it decrements `count` by 1 because the transition from '0' to '1' was already counted in the loop.

5. **Output:**
   - The final value of `count` is printed, which represents the minimum number of pieces needed.

### Correctness Check

To verify the correctness, let's consider some test cases:

1. **Test Case: "11010"**
   - The string needs to be split into "11", "0", "10".
   - The program correctly identifies the transitions and outputs 3.

2. **Test Case: "00000000"**
   - The string is already sorted, so no cuts are needed.
   - The program correctly outputs 1.

3. **Test Case: "1"**
   - The string is already sorted, so no cuts are needed.
   - The program correctly outputs 1.

4. **Test Case: "10"**
   - The string needs to be split into "1" and "0".
   - The program correctly identifies the transition and outputs 2.

5. **Test Case: "0001111"**
   - The string is already sorted, so no cuts are needed.
   - The program correctly outputs 1.

6. **Test Case: "0110"**
   - The string needs to be split into "01" and "10".
   - The program correctly identifies the transitions and outputs 2.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of pieces needed to sort the binary string. It handles all edge cases and transitions appropriately.
