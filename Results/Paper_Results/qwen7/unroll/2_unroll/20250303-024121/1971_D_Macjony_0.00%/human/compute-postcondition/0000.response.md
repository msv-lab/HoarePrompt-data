Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, and it is assigned the value of `int(input())`.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, after executing the code, `t` will be assigned the value of the integer input provided by the user, which must still fall within the range of 1 to 500. All other conditions and constraints on `t` remain valid.
