### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`. This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases, especially when the number of test cases (`t`) is small (up to 100).

2. **Loop Over Test Cases**: The program iterates over each test case, extracting `n` (the number of coins) and `s` (the string representing the initial state of the coins). This is done correctly.

3. **Function Call**: The function `func_1(s)` is called with the string `s` for each test case. This function is responsible for determining the winner based on the number of facing-up coins.

4. **Function Logic**:
   - The function counts the number of facing-up coins (`num_up`) using `s.count('U')`.
   - If the count of facing-up coins is odd, the function returns `'YES'`, indicating that Alice wins.
   - If the count of facing-up coins is even, the function returns `'NO'`, indicating that Bob wins.

5. **Game Rules Compliance**:
   - The logic in `func_1` aligns with the game rules provided. Specifically, the game ends when there are no more facing-up coins, and the player who faces this situation loses.
   - The function correctly identifies whether the number of facing-up coins is odd or even, which determines the winner based on optimal play.

6. **Output Format**: The program outputs "YES" or "NO" for each test case, which matches the required output format.

Given that the function logic correctly implements the game rules and the input handling is appropriate, the program should produce the correct output for the given examples and any valid input within the constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
