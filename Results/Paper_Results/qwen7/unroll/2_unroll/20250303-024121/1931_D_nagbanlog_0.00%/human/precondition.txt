t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; each test case is a list containing three integers n, x, and y, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
