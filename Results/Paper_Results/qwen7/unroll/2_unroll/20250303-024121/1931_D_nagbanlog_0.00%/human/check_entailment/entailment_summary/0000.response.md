Reasoning:
1. The program aims to find the number of "beautiful pairs" in an array based on the given conditions.
2. The program iterates through each test case, and for each element in the array, it calculates the modular values (`mod_x` and `mod_y`) and checks if there are any previously seen elements that satisfy the conditions for forming a "beautiful pair".
3. The program uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of these modular values.
4. The logic for determining "beautiful pairs" seems correct:
   - It correctly calculates the required modular values for each element.
   - It updates the count of "beautiful pairs" based on the frequency of these required modular values.
5. The program prints intermediate steps which are useful for debugging but do not affect the correctness of the logic.
6. The final count of "beautiful pairs" is appended to the results list for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding "beautiful pairs" based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
