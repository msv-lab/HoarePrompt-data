### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires counting the number of pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) such that \(1 \le i < j \le n\) and both conditions \(a_i + a_j \mod x = 0\) and \(a_i - a_j \mod y = 0\) are satisfied.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - For a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be beautiful, the following must hold:
     \[
     (a_i + a_j) \mod x = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad (a_i - a_j) \mod y = 0
     \]
   - This can be simplified to finding pairs where:
     \[
     a_i \equiv b \pmod{x} \quad \text{and} \quad a_j \equiv c \pmod{y}
     \]
     where \(b\) and \(c\) are specific values derived from the conditions.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided function `func_1` iterates through each element in the array and calculates its modulus with respect to `x` and `y`.
   - It then checks if the required modulus values exist in a frequency dictionary (`freq`). If they do, it increments the count of beautiful pairs.
   - The logic seems to be attempting to find pairs that satisfy the conditions by checking the frequency of the required modulus values.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The code prints intermediate steps which are not necessary for the final result but do not affect correctness.
   - The main issue is in the logic of calculating `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y`. Specifically, the calculation of `required_mod_x` should be:
     \[
     \text{required\_mod\_x} = ((-a_i) \mod x) \mod x
     \]
     This ensures that the value is within the range \([0, x-1]\).

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The corrected logic should ensure that the required modulus values are correctly calculated and checked against the frequency dictionary.

### Re-evaluation Based on Function Summary:

- The function summary accurately describes the purpose and behavior of the function. It processes each test case, calculates the required modulus values, and uses a frequency dictionary to count the number of beautiful pairs.
- The logic of using a frequency dictionary to count pairs that satisfy the conditions is sound.
- The issue identified in the original assessment is correct. The calculation of `required_mod_x` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is within the range \([0, x-1]\).

### Conclusion:

The provided code has a logical error in the calculation of `required_mod_x`. The current implementation might not correctly identify all beautiful pairs. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate. The program needs to be fixed to correctly calculate `required_mod_x` as described.
