State: **`results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `case` and `test_cases`.
2. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one element because the loop iterates over each element in `test_cases`.
3. The variable `case` will take on the value of each element in `test_cases` during each iteration, but its initial state before the loop does not need to be specified since it changes within the loop body.
4. The state of `results` is not relevant to the loop's execution condition, so it remains as an empty list.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `test_cases` must be a non-empty list.
