### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires counting the number of pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) such that \(1 \le i < j \le n\) and both conditions \(a_i + a_j \mod x = 0\) and \(a_i - a_j \mod y = 0\) are satisfied.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - For a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be beautiful, the following must hold:
     \[
     (a_i + a_j) \mod x = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad (a_i - a_j) \mod y = 0
     \]
   - This can be simplified to finding pairs where:
     \[
     a_i \equiv b \pmod{x} \quad \text{and} \quad a_j \equiv c \pmod{y}
     \]
     where \(b\) and \(c\) are specific values derived from the conditions.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided function `func_1` iterates through each element in the array and calculates its modulus with respect to `x` and `y`.
   - It then checks if the required modulus values exist in a frequency dictionary (`freq`). If they do, it increments the count of beautiful pairs.
   - The logic seems to be attempting to find pairs that satisfy the conditions by checking the frequency of the required modulus values.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The code prints intermediate steps which are not necessary for the final result but do not affect correctness.
   - The main issue is in the logic of calculating `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y`. Specifically, the calculation of `required_mod_x` should be:
     \[
     \text{required\_mod\_x} = ((-a_i) \mod x) \mod x
     \]
     This ensures that the value is within the range \([0, x-1]\).

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The corrected logic should ensure that the required modulus values are correctly calculated and checked against the frequency dictionary.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotated Code:

- **Initialization**:
  - The function initializes an empty list `results` to store the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.
  - It iterates over each test case, extracting `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `a`.

- **Modulo Calculations**:
  - For each number `num` in the array `a`, it calculates `mod_x = num % x` and `mod_y = num % y`.
  - It then calculates `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x` and `required_mod_y` as `mod_y`.
  - These calculations are correct and ensure that the values are within the required ranges.

- **Frequency Dictionary**:
  - A dictionary `freq` is used to keep track of the frequency of each pair of `(mod_x, mod_y)`.
  - If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in `freq`, it increments the `beautiful_count` by the frequency of this pair.
  - Otherwise, it adds the pair to `freq` with a count of 0 and increments it.

- **Output**:
  - After processing all numbers in the array, it prints the count of beautiful pairs and appends it to the `results` list.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to find beautiful pairs. The logic of calculating `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` is correct and ensures that the pairs are counted accurately. The intermediate prints are unnecessary but do not affect the correctness of the program.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
