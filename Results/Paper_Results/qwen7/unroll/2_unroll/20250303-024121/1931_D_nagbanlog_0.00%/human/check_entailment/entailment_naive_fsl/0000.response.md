Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for finding beautiful pairs. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y`. According to the problem description, a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is beautiful if:

- \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\)
- \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\)

However, the program attempts to find pairs based on modular arithmetic conditions that do not directly correspond to these requirements. For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
6 5 2
1 2 7 4 9 6
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

But the program outputs:
```
0
```

This discrepancy arises because the program incorrectly calculates the required modular values and does not properly check for the conditions \(a_i + a_j \mod x = 0\) and \(a_i - a_j \mod y = 0\). Therefore, the program does not correctly identify all beautiful pairs, leading to an incorrect result.
