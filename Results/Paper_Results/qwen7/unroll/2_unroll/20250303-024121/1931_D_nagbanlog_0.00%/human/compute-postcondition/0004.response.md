Output State: **The program returns a list called 'results' which contains the count of beautiful pairs for each test case processed. Each element in the list corresponds to the output of the 'beautiful_count' variable for each iteration of the outer loop. The 'beautiful_count' is calculated based on the conditions specified within the nested loop, considering the frequency of numbers with specific modular values relative to 'x' and 'y'.**

This means that the program processes multiple test cases, and for each test case, it calculates the number of "beautiful pairs" based on certain conditions involving the modular values of numbers relative to `x` and `y`. The result for each test case is stored in the `results` list, and finally, the entire list is returned.
