### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
A pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The program aims to count such pairs in the given array.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The program iterates through each element in the array and uses modular arithmetic to find pairs that satisfy the conditions for being beautiful. However, the way it calculates `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` is incorrect.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the problematic parts:

1. **Modular Calculations:**
   - `required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x`: This calculation is incorrect. It should be `required_mod_x = (x - (num % x)) % x`, but this still doesn't align with the problem's requirement.
   - `required_mod_y = mod_y`: This is also incorrect. It should be `required_mod_y = (y - (num % y)) % y`.

2. **Pair Counting Logic:**
   - The program checks if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the frequency dictionary `freq`. If it does, it increments the `beautiful_count`.
   - However, the way `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` are calculated does not correctly reflect the conditions \(a_i + a_j \mod x = 0\) and \(a_i - a_j \mod y = 0\).

To correctly implement the logic, we need to:
- Calculate the required modular values for each element based on the conditions.
- Use these values to count the pairs that satisfy the conditions.

#### Correct Approach:
1. **Calculate Required Mod Values:**
   - For each element `num` in the array, calculate `mod_x = num % x` and `mod_y = num % y`.
   - To find the required `mod_x` and `mod_y` for a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\), we need:
     - `required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x`
     - `required_mod_y = (y - mod_y) % y`

2. **Count Pairs:**
   - Use a frequency dictionary to keep track of how many times each `(mod_x, mod_y)` combination appears.
   - For each element, check if the required `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the frequency dictionary and increment the count accordingly.

#### Correct Implementation:
```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        (n, x, y) = case['params']
        a = case['array']
        freq = {}
        beautiful_count = 0
        print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
        
        # Calculate frequencies
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
            required_mod_y = (y - mod_y) % y
            
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
            
            if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
                freq[(mod_x, mod_y)] = 0
            freq[(mod_x, mod_y)] += 1
        
        print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
        results.append(beautiful_count)
    
    return results
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for finding beautiful pairs. The corrected implementation above addresses the issues and should now correctly count the beautiful pairs.

**Final: False**
