The function accepts a string `expression` consisting of "+" and "-" characters and an integer `length` representing the length of `expression`. It counts the number of "+" characters in `expression`, calculates the difference between `length` and this count, and returns the absolute value of the difference between this calculated difference and the count of "+" characters.
