Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty according to the problem description. The function `func_1` calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' in the string, which does not necessarily lead to the optimal splitting of the array `a`. For example, consider the input:

```
5
-----
```

The expected output is 5, as explained in Example 2. However, the program outputs 0, which is incorrect. The program fails to handle the optimal splitting of the array to minimize the penalty. A correct approach would involve dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to find the optimal splits.
