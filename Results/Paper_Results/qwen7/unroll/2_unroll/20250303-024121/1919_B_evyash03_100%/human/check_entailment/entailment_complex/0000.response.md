Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's analyze the steps and the provided code:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case by reading the length of the string (`length`) and the string itself (`expression`).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `expression` (a string of "+" and "-") and `length` (an integer).
   - It counts the number of "+" characters in `expression` and stores this count in `count`.
   - It calculates `sub` as the difference between the length of the string and the count of "+" characters.
   - It returns the absolute value of the difference between `sub` and `count`.

However, the logic implemented in `func_1` is incorrect for calculating the minimum possible penalty. Hereâ€™s why:

- The goal is to split the array `a` (represented by `expression`) into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
- The current implementation simply calculates the difference between the number of "+" and "-" characters and returns the absolute value of this difference, which does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to consider all possible ways to split the array and choose the one with the minimum penalty. This involves dynamic programming or a more sophisticated approach to find the optimal partitioning.

Given the provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
