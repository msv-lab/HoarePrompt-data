Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The optimal strategy involves splitting the array into segments where the sum of elements in each segment is zero, thereby minimizing the penalty.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `length` and the string `expression`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(expression, length)` and prints the result.
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of '+' characters in the string `expression` and calculates the difference between the total length and this count, returning the absolute value of this difference.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the penalty. It simply returns the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which does not necessarily lead to the minimum penalty.
   - To achieve the minimum penalty, we should aim to create subarrays with sums of zero whenever possible. This means grouping consecutive '+' and '-' characters together until the sum becomes zero, and then splitting at those points.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `-----`, the function incorrectly returns `5` instead of `0` because it just counts the difference between the number of '+' and '-'.
   - For the input `+-+-+-`, the function returns `0` but the correct answer should be `2` because we can split it into `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])`.

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
