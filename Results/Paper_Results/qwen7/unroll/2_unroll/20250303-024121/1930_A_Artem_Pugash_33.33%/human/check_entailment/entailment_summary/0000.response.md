Reasoning:
The provided program aims to calculate the maximum score by selecting pairs of integers and adding the minimum value of each pair to the score. However, the logic in the program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for achieving the maximum score.

Here's the breakdown of the issues:
1. **Sorting**: The integers are sorted in ascending order, which is correct.
2. **Pair Selection**: The program pops the first two elements from the sorted list and adds the smaller one to the score. This approach does not necessarily yield the maximum score. For example, consider the input `1 2 3 4`. Sorting gives `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The program would pick `(1, 2)` and add `1` to the score, then `(3, 4)` and add `3` to the score, resulting in a total score of `4`. However, the optimal solution would be to pick `(1, 4)` and `(2, 3)` which results in a score of `5`.

To achieve the maximum score, we should always pick the smallest available number and the largest available number to form pairs. This ensures that the minimum of each pair is maximized.

Given this analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy.

Correctness: **False**
