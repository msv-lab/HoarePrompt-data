State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `i` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `numCases`.
2. For the loop to execute, `numCases` must be at least 1 because the `range(numCases)` function generates numbers from 0 to `numCases-1`.
3. The variable `t` is not directly involved in the loop condition but is mentioned in the initial state. It is constrained to be between 1 and 5000.
4. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts, as per the `range(numCases)` syntax.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `numCases` (must be greater than 0) and `i` (initialized to 0).
