Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`numCases`) and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the value of `numInteger` which is `2n`, and then reads the list of integers.
3. The integers are sorted in ascending order.
4. A while loop is used to repeatedly take the smallest pair of integers from the list, add their minimum value to the total score (`suma`), and remove them from the list until the list is empty.
5. The final score (`suma`) is printed for each test case.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the program matches the requirements. The sorting ensures that the smallest elements are always paired together, which is optimal for maximizing the score because the minimum of any pair contributes to the score.

Correctness: **True**
