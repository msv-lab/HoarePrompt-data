Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has an issue with how it processes the input and calculates the score. Specifically, the logic for popping elements from the sorted list does not correctly simulate the process of choosing the minimum of two elements and adding it to the score. Instead of popping two elements at a time, the current implementation incorrectly assumes that the smallest elements are always at the beginning of the list and pops them one by one, which doesn't guarantee the optimal score.

To fix this, we should pair the smallest available elements in each iteration, ensuring that we always add the minimum of the two chosen elements to the score. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
        numbers.sort()
        suma = 0
        while len(numbers) > 1:
            # Take the two smallest elements
            a = numbers.pop(0)
            b = numbers.pop(0)
            # Add the minimum of the two to the score
            suma += min(a, b)
        print(suma)
```

This corrected version ensures that we always choose the two smallest available elements in each iteration, which is the optimal strategy for maximizing the score.
