Output State: **`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5⋅10^4. Other variables are not affected.**

This means that the variable `t` now holds the integer value entered by the user, and it is constrained to be within the specified range. The other variables remain in their initial state, meaning they are not yet assigned any values.
