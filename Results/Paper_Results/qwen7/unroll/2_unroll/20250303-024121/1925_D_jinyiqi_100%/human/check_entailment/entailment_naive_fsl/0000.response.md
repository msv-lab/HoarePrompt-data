Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the program calculates the sum of friendship values without considering the probability of choosing each pair and the effect of increasing friendship values for friends after the first choice.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

```
3
2 1 1
1 2 10
```

In this case, there are 2 children, 1 pair of friends, and 1 excursion. The friendship value of the pair is 10. According to the problem description, the expected value of the friendship value for the excursion is simply the initial friendship value, which is 10. However, the program calculates `p * pow(q, -1, M) % M` without correctly reflecting the expected value calculation.

The correct approach involves calculating the expected value based on the probability of choosing each pair and the effect of increasing friendship values for friends. The given program does not account for these factors, leading to incorrect results.
