Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases defined by integers t, n, m, k, and a list of friend pairs (a_i, b_i, f_i). For each test case, it checks if the given conditions are met and processes the friend pairs accordingly.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases where each case includes a number of test instances (t), along with other integers (n, m, k) and a series of friend pairs (a_i, b_i, f_i). The function ensures that all conditions specified for these parameters are satisfied and processes the friend pairs as required.
