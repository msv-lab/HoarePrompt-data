Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves integers \( t \), \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), along with a list of friend pairs \((a_i, b_i, f_i)\). For each test case, it calculates a specific mathematical expression involving these inputs, simplifies the result using the greatest common divisor (gcd), and then computes the modular inverse and final result modulo \( M \). The function outputs a series of integers, each corresponding to the calculated result for each test case.**
