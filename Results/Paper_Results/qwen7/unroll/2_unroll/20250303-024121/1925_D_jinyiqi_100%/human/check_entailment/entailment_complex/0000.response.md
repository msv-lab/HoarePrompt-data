Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for \( k \) excursions. The key points are:
   - Each excursion randomly selects a pair of children.
   - If the selected pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The goal is to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values at the time of selection, expressed as \( \frac{p}{q} \) where \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime, and then compute \( p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).
   - It sums up the friendship values \( f_i \) for all pairs of friends.
   - It calculates \( \text{cn2} = \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} \), which represents the total number of unique pairs of children.
   - The formula \( p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \text{cn2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1) \) and \( q = 2 \cdot \text{cn2}^2 \) are used to derive the numerator and denominator of the expected value.
   - The greatest common divisor (gcd) is computed to simplify the fraction.
   - Finally, it calculates \( p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \) and prints the result.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic for calculating the expected value is correct based on the problem statement.
   - The use of modular arithmetic and the modular inverse ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.
   - The code handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

Based on the above analysis, the given program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
