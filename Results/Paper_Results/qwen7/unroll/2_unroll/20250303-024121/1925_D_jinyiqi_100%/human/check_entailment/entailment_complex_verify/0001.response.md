### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Calculating the Sum of Friendship Values:**
   - The program correctly accumulates the sum of all friendship values (`sum_f`).

3. **Calculating the Total Number of Unique Pairs:**
   - The program correctly calculates the total number of unique pairs (`cn2`), which is \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2} \).

4. **Expected Friendship Value Calculation:**
   - The program uses the formula:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = \frac{2 \times k \times \text{cn2} \times \text{sum\_f} + m \times k \times (k - 1)}{2 \times \text{cn2}^2}
     \]
   - Simplifying the numerator:
     \[
     2 \times k \times \text{cn2} \times \text{sum\_f} + m \times k \times (k - 1)
     \]
   - Simplifying the denominator:
     \[
     2 \times \text{cn2}^2
     \]

5. **Simplifying the Formula:**
   - The formula simplifies to:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = \frac{k \times \text{sum\_f}}{\text{cn2}}
     \]
   - This is because:
     \[
     \frac{2 \times k \times \text{cn2} \times \text{sum\_f} + m \times k \times (k - 1)}{2 \times \text{cn2}^2} = \frac{k \times \text{sum\_f} + \frac{m \times k \times (k - 1)}{2 \times \text{cn2}}}{\text{cn2}}
     \]
   - Since \( m \times k \times (k - 1) \) is much smaller compared to \( k \times \text{sum\_f} \) for large `k`, the term \( \frac{m \times k \times (k - 1)}{2 \times \text{cn2}^2} \) is negligible.

6. **GCD and Modulo Operation:**
   - The program uses the greatest common divisor (GCD) to simplify the fraction.
   - It then calculates the modular inverse of the denominator using `pow(q, -1, M)` and applies the modulo operation.

### Detailed Verification:

- **Sum of Friendship Values:**
  - The program correctly sums up all friendship values for each test case.

- **Total Number of Unique Pairs:**
  - The calculation of `cn2` is correct and represents the total number of unique pairs.

- **Expected Value Calculation:**
  - The formula used in the program is correct and simplifies to \( \frac{k \times \text{sum\_f}}{\text{cn2}} \).

- **GCD and Modular Inverse:**
  - The use of GCD ensures the fraction is in its simplest form.
  - The modular inverse calculation is correct and ensures the result is in the form \( \frac{p}{q} \) where \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime.

- **Modulo Operation:**
  - The final result is computed correctly using modular arithmetic.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the expected value and handles the required mathematical operations accurately.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
