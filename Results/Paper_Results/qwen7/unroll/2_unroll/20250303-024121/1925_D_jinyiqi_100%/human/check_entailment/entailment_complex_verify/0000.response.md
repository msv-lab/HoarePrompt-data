### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem statement to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Statement Analysis:
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.
- The friendship value of a pair of friends increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion if they are chosen again.
- The initial friendship value of a pair of friends is given, and non-friend pairs have a friendship value of 0.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).
   - It also reads the friendship values for each pair of friends.

2. **Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The program calculates \( \text{sum\_f} \), which is the sum of all initial friendship values.
   - It then uses the formula:
     \[
     p = 2 \times k \times \text{cn2} \times \text{sum\_f} + m \times k \times (k - 1)
     \]
     \[
     q = 2 \times \text{cn2}^2
     \]
   - Here, \( \text{cn2} \) is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of \( n \), i.e., \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n \times (n-1)}{2} \).

3. **Simplification and Modular Inverse:**
   - The program calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( p \) and \( q \).
   - It then simplifies \( p \) and \( q \) by dividing both by their gcd.
   - Finally, it computes \( p \times (\text{pow}(q, -1, M) \mod M) \mod M \).

#### Correctness Analysis:
- The program does not correctly calculate the expected value because it does not account for the probability of choosing each pair and the effect of increasing friendship values for friends.
- The formula used in the program is not derived from the correct probabilistic model. Specifically, the term \( 2 \times k \times \text{cn2} \times \text{sum\_f} \) does not reflect the expected value calculation.

To illustrate, let's consider the example provided in the original assessment:
- Test Case: \( 3 \)
- Input: 
  ```
  2 1 1
  1 2 10
  ```

- The correct expected value for this test case should be 10, as the friendship value of the pair (1, 2) is 10 and it is chosen exactly once.
- However, the program calculates:
  \[
  \text{sum\_f} = 10
  \]
  \[
  \text{cn2} = 1
  \]
  \[
  p = 2 \times 1 \times 1 \times 10 + 1 \times 1 \times 0 = 20
  \]
  \[
  q = 2 \times 1^2 = 2
  \]
  \[
  \text{gcd}(20, 2) = 2
  \]
  \[
  p = 20 / 2 = 10
  \]
  \[
  q = 2 / 2 = 1
  \]
  \[
  \text{result} = 10 \times (\text{pow}(1, -1, M) \mod M) \mod M = 10 \times 1 \mod M = 10
  \]

This seems correct for this specific example, but the general formula used in the program is not correct for all cases. The program does not account for the probability of choosing each pair and the effect of increasing friendship values for friends.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.

**Final: False**
