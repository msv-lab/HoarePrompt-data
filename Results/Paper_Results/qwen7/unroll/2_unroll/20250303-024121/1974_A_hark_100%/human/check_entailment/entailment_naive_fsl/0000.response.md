Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place the icons. Let's analyze a few cases to demonstrate this:

1. **Case 1**: `x = 1`, `y = 1`
   - According to the problem, we need to place 1 icon of size 1x1 and 1 icon of size 2x2.
   - The grid size is 5x3, which means we can fit up to 15 icons of size 1x1 or 4 icons of size 2x2.
   - The program calculates the number of screens needed but does not handle the placement logic correctly. It should consider the best way to place the 2x2 icon first, then fill the remaining space with 1x1 icons.
   - The correct answer should be 1 screen, but the program might incorrectly calculate it as 2 screens due to the logic used.

2. **Case 2**: `x = 7`, `y = 2`
   - We need to place 7 icons of size 1x1 and 2 icons of size 2x2.
   - The program might incorrectly calculate the number of screens needed without considering the optimal placement of the 2x2 icons first.

Given these examples, the program does not correctly handle the placement logic and may produce incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
