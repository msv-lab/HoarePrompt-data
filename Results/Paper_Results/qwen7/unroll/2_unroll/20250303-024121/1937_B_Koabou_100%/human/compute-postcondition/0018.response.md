Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and two binary strings `a_1` and `a_2`. For each test case, it constructs a new string `s` based on certain conditions involving characters from `a_1` and `a_2`. It then determines the length of the longest matching substring between `s` and a portion of `a_2`, starting from index `y` to `x`. Finally, it prints the constructed string `s` and the length of the matching substring (which could be 1 or the length of the matching substring if one is found).**
