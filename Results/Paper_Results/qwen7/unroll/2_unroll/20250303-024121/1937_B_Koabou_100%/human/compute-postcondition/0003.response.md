Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list containing two elements which are the inputs provided during the loop executions, and `a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n}` and `a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n}` are the original binary strings; list `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer.

Explanation: The loop runs twice and appends the input values to the list `a`. Since the loop runs exactly 2 times, the list `a` will contain two elements, which are the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and the binary strings) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
