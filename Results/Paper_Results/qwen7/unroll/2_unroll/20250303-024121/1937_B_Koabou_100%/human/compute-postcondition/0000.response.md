Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and two binary strings `a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n}` and `a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n}` are given, where each `a_{ij}` is either 0 or 1; list `a` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `a`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from the initial state, and the binary strings are also unaffected. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and the binary strings, while adding that `a` is now an empty list.
