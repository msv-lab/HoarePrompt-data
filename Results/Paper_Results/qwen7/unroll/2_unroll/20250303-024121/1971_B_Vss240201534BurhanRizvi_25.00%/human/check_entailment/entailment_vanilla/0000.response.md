### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to rearrange the characters of a given string `s` to form a new string `r` that is different from `s`. If no such rearrangement is possible, we should output "NO".

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program takes an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.
   - It then uses `random.sample(s, len(s))` to create a new string `s2` by randomly shuffling the characters of `s`.
   - If `s` is not equal to `s2`, it prints "Yes" followed by `s2`.
   - If `s` is equal to `s2`, it prints "No".

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Step 1**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop that iterates `t` times.
   - **Step 2**: The use of `random.sample(s, len(s))` ensures that `s2` is a random permutation of `s`.
   - **Step 3**: The condition `if s != s2:` checks if the new string `s2` is different from the original string `s`.
   - **Step 4**: If `s` and `s2` are different, the program prints "Yes" followed by `s2`, which satisfies the requirement.
   - **Step 5**: If `s` and `s2` are the same, the program prints "No", which also satisfies the requirement.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Case 1**: If the string `s` consists of all unique characters, `random.sample(s, len(s))` will always produce a different string since all permutations are distinct.
   - **Case 2**: If the string `s` has repeated characters, there might be a chance that `s2` could be the same as `s`. However, the program correctly identifies this scenario and outputs "No".
   - **Case 3**: The program handles strings of length up to 10, which is within the specified limit.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to check if a rearranged string `s2` is different from the original string `s` and handles all edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
