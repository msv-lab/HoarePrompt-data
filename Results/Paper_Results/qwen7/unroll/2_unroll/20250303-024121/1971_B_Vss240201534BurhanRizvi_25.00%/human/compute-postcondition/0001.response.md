Output State: **For each test case, the output will either print 'Yes' followed by a randomly permuted version of the input string, or 'No' if the string does not change after permutation. The number of test cases and their respective outputs depend on the input provided during the loop's execution.**

This means that for each test case, if the input string `s` can be rearranged into a different string (i.e., it contains more than one unique character), the program will print 'Yes' followed by a random permutation of the string. If the string remains the same after any possible permutation (i.e., it is already a single character repeated or has no repeated characters), the program will print 'No'.
