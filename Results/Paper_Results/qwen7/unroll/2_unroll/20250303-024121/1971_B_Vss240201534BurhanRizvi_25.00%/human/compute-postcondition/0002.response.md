Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a test case where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. The function does not return any value directly but implies it might print or process `t` and `s` within its scope.**
