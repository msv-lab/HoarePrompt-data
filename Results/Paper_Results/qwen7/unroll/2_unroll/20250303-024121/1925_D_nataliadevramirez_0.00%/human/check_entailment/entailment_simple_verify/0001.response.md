### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to ensure its correctness.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - If a pair of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The initial friendship value of a friend pair is given, and we need to compute the expected value considering the increase in friendship values over \( k \) excursions.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Each pair of friends will be chosen with probability \( \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - For each pair of friends, the expected increase in friendship value due to being chosen is \( k \).

3. **Given Functions:**
   - `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)` calculates the contribution of each friendship to the expected value.
   - `func_2()` reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.

4. **Analysis of `func_1`:**
   - The function iterates over each friendship and adds the product of the friendship value and the expected increase in value due to being chosen \( k \) times.
   - The formula used is \( f \times \left( k \times \frac{k + 1}{2} \right) \), which is the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each pair over \( k \) excursions.
   - The result is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

5. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct. It correctly calculates the expected value for each friendship and sums these values.
   - The use of the formula \( k \times \frac{k + 1}{2} \) is appropriate because it represents the sum of the first \( k \) natural numbers, which is the expected number of times a pair will be chosen.

6. **Overall Functionality:**
   - `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes each test case using `func_1`.
   - The overall structure and logic of the program match the requirements of the problem.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotated Code:

- **Initialization:**
  - `MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7` is a constant used for modular arithmetic.
  - `func_2()` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - Iterates over each friendship.
  - For each friendship, it calculates the expected increase in value due to being chosen \( k \) times.
  - Adds the result to the cumulative sum `result`.
  - Returns the final result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - Reads the input for each test case.
  - Calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.
  - Prints the result for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It accurately calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.

**Correctness: True**

### Final Evaluation:
