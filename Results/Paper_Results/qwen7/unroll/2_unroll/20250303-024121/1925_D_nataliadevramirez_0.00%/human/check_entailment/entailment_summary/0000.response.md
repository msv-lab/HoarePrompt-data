Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.
2. The given code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
3. `func_2` handles the overall structure of processing multiple test cases, reading input, and calling `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.
4. `func_1` is responsible for computing the sum of the friendship values for each pair, considering the expected increase in friendship value due to the excursions.
5. The formula used in `func_1` is \( f \times \binom{k}{2} \mod \text{MOD} \), where \( f \) is the initial friendship value of the pair, and \( \binom{k}{2} \) represents the number of ways to choose 2 out of \( k \) excursions. This formula correctly accounts for the expected increase in friendship value over \( k \) excursions.
6. The implementation in `func_1` multiplies each friendship value by the combination of \( k \) taken 2, which is equivalent to \( \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \). This calculation is done modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle large numbers.
7. The overall structure of the code correctly processes each test case and outputs the expected result for each one.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
