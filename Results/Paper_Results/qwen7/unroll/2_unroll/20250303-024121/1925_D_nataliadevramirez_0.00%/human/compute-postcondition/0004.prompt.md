You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer representing the number of children, m is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends, k is an integer representing the number of excursions, and friendships is a list of lists, where each inner list contains three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value respectively.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        
        print(result)
        
    #State: After executing the loop `t` times, the output state will consist of `t` results returned by the function `func_1`. Each result is the outcome of processing the inputs `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of `friendships` for each iteration. The exact values of these results depend on the implementation of `func_1` and the specific inputs provided in each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` (all integers) and a list `friendships`. It processes these inputs to handle `t` test cases involving `n` children, `m` pairs of friends, and `k` excursions, based on the friendship values provided.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
