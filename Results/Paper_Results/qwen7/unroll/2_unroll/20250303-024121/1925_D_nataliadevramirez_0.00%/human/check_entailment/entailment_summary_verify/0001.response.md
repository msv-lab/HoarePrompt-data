### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to ensure its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.
- If a pair of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
- The initial friendship value of a friend pair is given, and we need to compute the expected value considering the increase in friendship values over \( k \) excursions.

#### Key Points from the Original Assessment:
1. **Probability of Choosing a Pair**: Each pair of friends will be chosen with probability \( \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
2. **Expected Increase in Friendship Value**: For each pair of friends, the expected increase in friendship value due to being chosen is \( k \).
3. **Formula Used**: The formula \( f \times \left( k \times \frac{k + 1}{2} \right) \) is used to calculate the expected value for each friendship.
4. **Modulo Operation**: The result is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates over each friendship and adds the product of the friendship value and the expected increase in value due to being chosen \( k \) times.
   - The formula \( f \times \left( k \times \frac{k + 1}{2} \right) \) is correct because it represents the sum of the first \( k \) natural numbers, which is the expected number of times a pair will be chosen.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case using `func_1`.
   - The overall structure and logic of the program match the requirements of the problem.

#### Verification Using Function Summaries:
- The function summary for `func_2` indicates that it processes `t` test cases, each involving `n` children, `m` pairs of friends, and `k` excursions.
- It reads the number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions, along with the friendship values, and calls `func_1` to compute the result.
- Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

#### Correctness Check:
- The logic in `func_1` is correct and matches the problem statement.
- The use of the formula \( k \times \frac{k + 1}{2} \) is appropriate.
- The modulo operation ensures the result is within the required constraints.

### Conclusion:
After re-evaluating the program and verifying the logic, the given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It accurately calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.

**Final: True**
