Output State: **After executing the loop `t` times, the output state will consist of `t` results returned by the function `func_1`. Each result is the outcome of processing the inputs `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of `friendships` for each iteration. The exact values of these results depend on the implementation of `func_1` and the specific inputs provided in each iteration.**
