### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program and the problem description carefully.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns removing one coin from their respective wallets.
- The player who cannot make a valid move loses.
- Both players play optimally.
- Determine the winner based on the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it compares the absolute difference between `a` and `b`.
- If the difference is even, it prints "Bob".
- Otherwise, it prints "Alice".

#### Correctness Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics**:
   - If the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even, the player whose turn it is will eventually end up with zero coins and lose.
   - Conversely, if the absolute difference is odd, the player whose turn it is can always ensure that the difference remains odd, forcing the opponent into a losing position.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly identifies that if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, Alice will lose and Bob will win.
   - This aligns with the problem statement that the player with the even difference will lose.

3. **Test Case Verification**:
   - Consider the test case `1 1`:
     - Initially, \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\).
     - The absolute difference is \(|1 - 1| = 0\), which is even.
     - According to the problem, Alice (with the even difference) should lose, so the correct output should be "Bob".
     - The program correctly prints "Bob".

   - Consider another test case `1 4`:
     - Initially, \(a = 1\) and \(b = 4\).
     - The absolute difference is \(|1 - 4| = 3\), which is odd.
     - According to the problem, Alice (with the odd difference) can force Bob into a losing position, so the correct output should be "Alice".
     - The program correctly prints "Alice".

Based on the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement. The original assessment was incorrect because it misinterpreted the condition for determining the winner.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
