Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three positive integers: `t`, `a`, and `b`. It reads these integers from standard input, where `t` specifies the number of test cases. For each test case, the function compares the absolute difference between `a` and `b`. If the difference is even, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice". After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no explicit return value but outputs a series of "Bob" or "Alice" based on the conditions specified.**
