Reasoning:
The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Game Logic**: For each test case, the program calculates the absolute difference between `a` and `b` (`abs(a - b)`). Based on whether this difference is even or odd, it determines the winner:
   - If `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`, it prints "Bob".
   - Otherwise, it prints "Alice".

3. **Optimal Strategy**: The optimal strategy for this game involves understanding that the player whose turn it is when the absolute difference between the number of coins in their wallets is even will always lose if both players play optimally. This is because:
   - If the difference is even, the player can always make a move that keeps the difference even, eventually leading to a situation where the opponent has no valid move left.
   - Conversely, if the difference is odd, the player can force the difference to become even on the next turn, ensuring they win.

4. **Output**: The program outputs the correct result for each test case as per the examples provided in the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to determine the winner based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
