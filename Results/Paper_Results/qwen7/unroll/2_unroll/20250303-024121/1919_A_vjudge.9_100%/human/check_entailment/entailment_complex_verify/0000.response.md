### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the problem statement carefully.

#### Problem Statement:
- Alice and Bob take turns removing one coin from their respective wallets.
- The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., has 0 coins left) loses.
- Both players play optimally.
- The player who ends up with an even difference in the number of coins after all moves will lose.

#### Key Points:
1. **Even Difference**: If the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even, the player who starts with that even difference will eventually end up with 0 coins and lose.
2. **Odd Difference**: If the absolute difference is odd, the player who starts with that odd difference will always have a non-zero number of coins and can force the other player into a losing position.

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

#### Analysis:
- The program checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even using `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`.
- If the difference is even, it prints "Bob".
- If the difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

This logic is actually correct according to the problem statement. Here's why:
- If the absolute difference is even, the player who starts with that even difference will eventually end up with 0 coins and lose, so the program correctly prints "Bob".
- If the absolute difference is odd, the player who starts with that odd difference will always have a non-zero number of coins and can force the other player into a losing position, so the program correctly prints "Alice".

#### Example Test Cases:
1. **Test Case 1**: `1 1`
   - Initial difference: \( |1 - 1| = 0 \) (even)
   - Correct output: "Bob"
   - Program output: "Bob"

2. **Test Case 2**: `1 4`
   - Initial difference: \( |1 - 4| = 3 \) (odd)
   - Correct output: "Alice"
   - Program output: "Alice"

3. **Test Case 3**: `5 3`
   - Initial difference: \( |5 - 3| = 2 \) (even)
   - Correct output: "Bob"
   - Program output: "Bob"

4. **Test Case 4**: `4 5`
   - Initial difference: \( |4 - 5| = 1 \) (odd)
   - Correct output: "Alice"
   - Program output: "Alice"

From the above analysis, we can see that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and accurately determines the winner based on the parity of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
