You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of three positive integers n, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = min(n, b - a)
        
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state consists of multiple lines, where each line corresponds to the output of one test case. For each test case, if \(b \leq a\), the output is \(a \times n\). Otherwise, the output is \(b \times k - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a\), with \(k = \min(n, b - a)\).
    #
    #This means for each test case, the output will either be a simple multiplication of \(a\) and \(n\) or a more complex calculation involving \(b\), \(a\), and \(k\), depending on the conditions specified in the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to maximize Bob's profit based on the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of why the program works for all potential cases:

1. **Case when \( b \leq a \)**:
   - If the modified price \( b \) is less than or equal to the usual price \( a \), it is not beneficial to sell any buns at the modified price because the total revenue would be lower. Therefore, the program correctly prints \( a \times n \).

2. **Case when \( b > a \)**:
   - The program calculates the value of \( k \) as \( \min(n, b - a) \). This ensures that \( k \) is the maximum number of buns that can be sold at the modified price without exceeding the total number of buns or the difference between \( b \) and \( a \).
   - The profit from selling the first \( k \) buns at the modified price is calculated as \( b \times k - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} \), which accounts for the decreasing price per bun.
   - The profit from selling the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price \( a \) is \( (n - k) \times a \).
   - The program then sums these two values to get the total profit, which is correct.

Since the program handles both scenarios correctly and no edge cases were found where the program fails to meet the requirements, the program is correct.
