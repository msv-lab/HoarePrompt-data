Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given promotion rules.
2. The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It calculates `k` as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.
   - If `b <= a`, it calculates the profit as `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the profit using the formula `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.
3. The formula used in the program is correct:
   - When `b > a`, the first `k` buns are sold at prices from `b` down to `b - k + 1`.
   - The sum of these prices is `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic and formulas as described in the problem statement, the annotated program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
