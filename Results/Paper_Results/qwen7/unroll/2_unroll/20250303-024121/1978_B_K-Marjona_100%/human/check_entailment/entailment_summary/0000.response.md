Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the logic for determining the maximum profit based on the conditions given in the problem statement.
2. The variable `k` is calculated as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`, which aligns with the requirement to choose an integer `k` such that `0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b)`.
3. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the program correctly calculates the profit as `a * n`, meaning all buns are sold at the usual price.
4. If `b` is greater than `a`, the program calculates the profit using the formula `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`, which accounts for the modified price for the first `k` buns and the usual price for the remaining `(n - k)` buns.
5. The program processes each test case correctly and prints the result for each case without returning any value, which matches the expected behavior.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
