Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, the program reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. The variable `k` is calculated as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. This value determines how many buns are sold at the modified price.
4. If `b <= a`, the program prints `a * n`, which is the profit if no buns are sold at the modified price.
5. If `b > a`, the program calculates the profit using the formula `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`. This formula accounts for the reduced price of the first `k` buns and the usual price of the remaining buns.
6. The logic and calculations within the program align with the problem statement and the example provided.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
