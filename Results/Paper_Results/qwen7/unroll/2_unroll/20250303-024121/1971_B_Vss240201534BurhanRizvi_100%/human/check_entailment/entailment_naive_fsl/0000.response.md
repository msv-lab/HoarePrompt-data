Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it fails when the string consists of all unique characters. For example, consider the input "codeforces":

- The program generates a random permutation of the string.
- In this case, the generated permutation might still be "codeforces" due to the randomness.
- The program incorrectly outputs "Yes" and "codeforces" instead of "No".

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the generated string `s2` is different from the original string `s`. This can be achieved by checking if `s` and `s2` are the same before printing "Yes" and `s2`. If they are the same, the program should generate a new permutation until it finds one that is different.
