Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by generating a random permutation of the input string `s` and checking if it is different from the original string. However, there are a few issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Handling Single Character Strings**: The program correctly identifies single-character strings and outputs "No".
2. **Handling Strings with Only One Unique Character**: The program also correctly identifies strings with only one unique character and outputs "No".
3. **Generating Permutations**: The program generates a random permutation of the string using `random.sample`, which should work fine for most cases.
4. **Ensuring Different String**: The program ensures that the generated string `s2` is different from `s` by checking if `s == s2`. If they are the same, it tries to swap the first two characters, but this approach is flawed because it only swaps the first two characters and does not guarantee a different string for all cases.

However, the flaw in the logic is that simply swapping the first two characters is not sufficient to ensure that `s2` is different from `s` in all cases. For example, if the string is "aaab", swapping the first two characters would still result in "aaab".

To fix this, the program should generate a new permutation until it finds one that is different from the original string. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            while True:
                s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
                if s != s2:
                    break
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
```

Given the current implementation, the program might not always produce a different string, hence the logic is not fully correct.

Correctness: **False**
