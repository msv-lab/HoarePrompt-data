Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t` and then processing each test case individually.
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - For a string of length 1 (`if len(s) == 1:`), the program correctly outputs "No".
   - For a string with only one unique character (`elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:`), the program also correctly outputs "No".
3. **Permutation Generation**:
   - The program uses `random.sample(s, len(s))` to generate a random permutation of the string `s`.
   - If the generated permutation `s2` is the same as the original string `s`, it tries to create a different permutation by rotating the string (`s2 = s[1:] + s[0]`).
4. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program outputs "Yes" followed by the generated permutation `s2` if the conditions are met.
   - It outputs "No" otherwise.

Given the problem statement and the provided examples, the program correctly handles all cases as described. The logic is sound, and the program produces the expected output for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
