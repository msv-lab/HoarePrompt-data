Output State: **`i` is 1, `q` is an integer representing the position Vasya occupied in the line, `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling, both `q` and `x` satisfy 1 ≤ `x` < `q` ≤ 10^9; `M` is a list containing one element which is `w`; `w` is the square root of `q` and is an integer, and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is initialized to 1. No changes are made to `q`, `x`, `M`, or `w`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain as per the initial state.
