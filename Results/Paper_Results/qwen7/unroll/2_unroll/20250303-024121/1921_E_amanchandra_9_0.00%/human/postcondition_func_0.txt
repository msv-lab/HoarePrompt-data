The function processes multiple test cases, each containing six integers representing dimensions and positions. For each test case, it compares two positions (xa, ya) and (xb, yb). If xa is greater than xb, it prints 'Draw'. Otherwise, it calculates the horizontal distance between xa and xb and uses this to determine if the vertical position ya or yb falls within a specific range. Depending on whether this distance is odd or even, it decides if 'Alice' or 'Bob' wins, or if the result is 'Draw' again. The function returns a series of 'Draw', 'Alice', and 'Bob' based on these conditions for each test case.
