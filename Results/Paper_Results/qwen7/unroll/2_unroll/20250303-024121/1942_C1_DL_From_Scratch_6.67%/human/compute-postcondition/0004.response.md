Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes t test cases, where for each test case, it accepts n, x, and y as integers. It also accepts a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n representing the chosen vertices. After processing, it returns different outputs based on the conditions given.**

- For each test case, it checks if n, x, and y meet the specified constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 ⋅ 10^5), y = 0, and the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5).
- It then processes x distinct integers from 1 to n representing the chosen vertices.
- Based on the conditions and processing, it returns appropriate outputs for each test case.
