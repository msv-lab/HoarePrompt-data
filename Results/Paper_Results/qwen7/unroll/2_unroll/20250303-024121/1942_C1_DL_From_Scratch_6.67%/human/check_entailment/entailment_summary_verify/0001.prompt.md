You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        count = 0
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        num = n - list0[-1]
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        print(count + x - 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it accepts integers n, x, and y, and a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n. It calculates the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive elements in the sorted list of integers and adds one additional count for any gap between the last element of the list and the end of the range defined by n. Finally, it returns the sum of these counts plus x - 2 for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.
   - The cake is a regular polygon with \( n \) sides.
   - Bessie has chosen \( x \) vertices, and we can add up to \( y \) more vertices.
   - The goal is to form as many triangles as possible using these vertices.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The solution iterates through the chosen vertices to count the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices.
   - It counts the number of gaps of length 1, as these gaps can contribute to forming triangles.
   - After processing the gaps, it checks the remaining vertices at the end of the sequence to see if they can form additional triangles.

3. **Key Points to Check**:
   - The logic for counting gaps of length 1 is correct because a gap of length 1 means there is a vertex right next to another chosen vertex, which can help form a triangle.
   - The final check for the remaining vertices is also correct because it accounts for any potential triangles that can be formed at the edges of the chosen vertices.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the edge case where the last segment might have a length of 1 correctly.
   - It also correctly handles the case where no additional vertices can be added (\( y = 0 \)).

5. **Validation**:
   - The example provided in the problem statement is correctly handled by the solution.
   - The solution logic matches the problem constraints and requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given solution correctly implements the logic to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
