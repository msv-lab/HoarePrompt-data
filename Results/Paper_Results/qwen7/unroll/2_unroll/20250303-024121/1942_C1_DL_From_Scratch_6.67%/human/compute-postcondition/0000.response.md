Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, and we have read the first line of each test case containing `n`, `x`, and `y`.**

Explanation: The code `T = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `T`. This integer `T` represents the number of test cases. After executing this line, we know that `T` is an integer within the specified range (1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4). Additionally, we have read the first line of each test case, which contains `n`, `x`, and `y`. However, since the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are not yet known, we only state that they have been read but do not specify their exact values. The other conditions and constraints for `n`, `x`, and `y` are preserved.
