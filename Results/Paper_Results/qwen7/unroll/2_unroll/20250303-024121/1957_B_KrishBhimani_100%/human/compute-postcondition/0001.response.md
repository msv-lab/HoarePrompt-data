Output State: t test cases are processed, each test case outputs two integers separated by a space. For each test case with n > 1, the first integer in the output is (1 << i) - 1 where i is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to k, and the second integer is k minus the first integer. For n = 1, it simply outputs k. The total number of test cases processed is equal to the input t.
