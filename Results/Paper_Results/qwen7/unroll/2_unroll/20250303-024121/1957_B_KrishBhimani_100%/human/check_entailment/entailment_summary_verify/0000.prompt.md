You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        if n == 1:
            print(k)
        else:
            arr = []
            k0 = k
            i = 0
            ans = []
            temp = 1
            while True:
                if temp * 2 < k:
                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:
                    break
            ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, if \( n = 1 \), it outputs \( k \). Otherwise, it calculates and outputs a list containing two elements: \( (2^i - 1) \) and \( (k - (2^i - 1)) \), followed by enough zeros to make the list length equal to \( n \). After processing all test cases, it outputs the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence for certain inputs.

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  2
  3 5
  3 7
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  1 2 2
  3 4 0
  ```

- Actual Output (using the provided program):
  ```
  1 4 0
  3 4 0
  ```

For the first test case (3 5), the output `1 4 0` does not maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence. The bitwise OR of `1 | 4 | 0` is `(100)_2`, which has only one 1. However, the expected output `1 2 2` results in a bitwise OR of `(111)_2`, which has three 1s, maximizing the number of 1s.

For the second test case (3 7), the output `3 4 0` also does not maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence. The bitwise OR of `3 | 4 | 0` is `(111)_2`, which has three 1s. However, the expected output `3 4 0` is already optimal.

Therefore, the program does not always produce the optimal solution, making it incorrect.
