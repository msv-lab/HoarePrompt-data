The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, if \( n = 1 \), it outputs \( k \). Otherwise, it calculates and outputs a list containing two elements: \( (2^i - 1) \) and \( (k - (2^i - 1)) \), followed by enough zeros to make the list length equal to \( n \). After processing all test cases, it outputs the results for each test case.
