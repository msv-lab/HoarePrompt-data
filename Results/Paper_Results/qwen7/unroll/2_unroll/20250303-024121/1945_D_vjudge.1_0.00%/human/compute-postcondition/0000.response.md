Output State: **`numero_testes` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `numero_testes` ≤ 10^4, and it is assigned the value of `int(input())`.**

The code `numero_testes = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `numero_testes`. Since the initial state specifies that `numero_testes` is an integer within the range [1, 10^4], after executing the code, `numero_testes` will still satisfy this condition but will now hold the specific integer value entered by the user. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
