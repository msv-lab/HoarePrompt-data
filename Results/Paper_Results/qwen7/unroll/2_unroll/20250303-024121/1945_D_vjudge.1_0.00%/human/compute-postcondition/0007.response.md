Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i`, `n`, and `k`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - The variable `n` is the length of the list `lista_B`.
   - The variable `k` is an input integer.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop `for i in range(n - k)` will execute as long as `i < n - k`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `n - k > 0`, meaning `n > k`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, we don't need to explicitly set it.
   - We need to ensure that `n > k` for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `pref` and `soma_b` do not affect the loop execution and can remain unchanged.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `n` must be greater than `k`.
- `i` starts from 0 (which doesn't need adjustment).

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`soma_b` is 0, `n` must be greater than `k`, `pref` is 0, `lista_B` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `i` is 0**
