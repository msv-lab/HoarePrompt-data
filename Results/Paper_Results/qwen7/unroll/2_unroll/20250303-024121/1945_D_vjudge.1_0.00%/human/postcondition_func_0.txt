The function accepts two lists, `lista_A` and `lista_B`, both containing `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and two positive integers `n` and `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000. It calculates and returns the minimum value obtained by adding the sum of elements in `lista_B` from index `n-k` to `n-1` (if these elements are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in `lista_A`) to the sum of remaining elements in `lista_A` from index `n-k` to `n-1`.
