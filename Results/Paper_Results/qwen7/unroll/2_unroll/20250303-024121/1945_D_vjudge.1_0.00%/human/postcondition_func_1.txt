The function processes a series of test cases defined by `numero_testes`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`. It iterates through `numero_testes` test cases, where for each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `m` and two lists `a` and `b` of length `n`. After processing all test cases, it outputs the results based on the given inputs.
