Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people. Specifically, the approach used in `func_1` reverses the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B`, which is unnecessary and incorrect for solving the problem. The reversal causes the algorithm to incorrectly calculate the costs associated with moving Kirill to an earlier position in the queue.

The correct approach involves iterating through the queue from the end towards the beginning, keeping track of the cumulative cost of moving Kirill to each position and ensuring that the total cost is minimized while respecting the constraint that Kirill must end up in one of the first `m` positions.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize variables
    total_cost = 0
    current_cost = 0
    min_cost = float('inf')
    
    # Iterate from the end of the queue to the start
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        # Calculate the cost to move to position i
        current_cost += lista_B[i]
        total_cost += lista_A[i]
        
        # Update the minimum cost if we are within the first m positions
        if n - i <= k:
            min_cost = min(min_cost, total_cost + current_cost)
    
    print(min_cost)

def func_2():
    numero_testes = int(input())
    for _ in range(numero_testes):
        func_1()
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people without the need to reverse the lists.
