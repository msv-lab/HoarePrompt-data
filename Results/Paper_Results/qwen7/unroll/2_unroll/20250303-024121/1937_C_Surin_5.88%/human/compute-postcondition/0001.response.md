Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4; `R` is a lambda function that takes input, splits it by spaces, and maps each element to an integer.**

The code defines a lambda function `R` that reads an integer input from the user. This does not change the values of `t` or `n`, nor does it affect the permutation `p` or the lambda function `I`. Therefore, these values remain as stated in the initial state. The new information is that `R` is now defined as a lambda function that reads an integer input.
