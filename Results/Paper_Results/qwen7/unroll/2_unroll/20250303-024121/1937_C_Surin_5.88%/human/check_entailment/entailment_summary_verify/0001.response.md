### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n`.

2. **Query Strategy:**
   - The program uses a specific strategy to find the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized.
   - It starts by comparing `p_v1 ⊕ p_v1` with `p_v2 ⊕ p_v2` for different values of `v1` and `v2`.
   - If `p_v1 ⊕ p_v1 < p_v2 ⊕ p_v2`, it updates `v1` to `v2`.
   - This process continues until `v1` is set to the index that gives the highest `p_v1 ⊕ p_v1` value.

3. **Finding the Maximum XOR Pair:**
   - After setting `v1`, the program iterates through all indices `i` from 1 to `n-1` and compares `p_v1 ⊕ p_i` with `p_v1 ⊕ p_prev`.
   - If `p_v1 ⊕ p_i > p_v1 ⊕ p_prev`, it updates `prev` to `i`.
   - This ensures that `prev` is the index that maximizes the XOR with `v1`.

4. **Output the Result:**
   - Finally, the program prints the indices `prev` and `v1` as the result.

#### Verification of Correctness

1. **Query Limit:**
   - The program makes at most `3n` queries, which satisfies the problem constraint.

2. **Maximizing XOR:**
   - The strategy used in the program aims to find the indices that maximize the XOR value.
   - By comparing `p_v1 ⊕ p_v1` with `p_v2 ⊕ p_v2` and updating `v1` accordingly, the program ensures that `v1` is likely to be part of the optimal pair.
   - However, the logic for updating `prev` is flawed. The program updates `prev` based on the comparison of `p_v1 ⊕ p_i` with `p_v1 ⊕ p_prev`, but this does not necessarily guarantee that `prev` will be the index that maximizes `p_i ⊕ p_j` for some `i` and `j`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where `n` is small (e.g., `n = 2`) correctly.
   - For larger `n`, the strategy still works as intended, but the logic for finding the maximum XOR pair is not robust.

#### Detailed Explanation

- **Initial Query Strategy:**
  - The program correctly identifies the index `v1` that maximizes `p_v1 ⊕ p_v1` by comparing it with other indices.
  
- **Finding the Maximum XOR Pair:**
  - The program iterates through all indices `i` from 1 to `n-1` and compares `p_v1 ⊕ p_i` with `p_v1 ⊕ p_prev`.
  - If `p_v1 ⊕ p_i > p_v1 ⊕ p_prev`, it updates `prev` to `i`.
  - This approach is flawed because it only considers the current value of `p_v1 ⊕ p_i` relative to `p_v1 ⊕ p_prev` without considering the overall maximum XOR value.

- **Example Counterexample:**
  - Consider a permutation `[0, 1, 2, 3]`.
  - If `v1` is initially set to 0, the program will compare `0 ⊕ 0` with `1 ⊕ 1`, `2 ⊕ 2`, and `3 ⊕ 3`.
  - It will update `v1` to 1 because `1 ⊕ 1 > 0 ⊕ 0`.
  - Then, it will iterate through indices 1 to 3 and compare `1 ⊕ 1` with `1 ⊕ 0`, `1 ⊕ 2`, and `1 ⊕ 3`.
  - It will update `prev` to 3 because `1 ⊕ 3 > 1 ⊕ 1`.
  - However, the maximum XOR value is actually `3 ⊕ 0 = 3`, not `1 ⊕ 3`.

#### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly identify the indices that maximize the XOR value. The logic for updating `prev` is flawed and does not guarantee the correct result.
