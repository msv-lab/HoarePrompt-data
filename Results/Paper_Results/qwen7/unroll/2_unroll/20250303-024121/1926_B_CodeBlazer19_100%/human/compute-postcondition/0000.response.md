Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and t is an input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, updating the value of `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 remains valid, and now it is explicitly stated that `t` is an input integer. The other conditions and variables (such as the grid) are not affected by this line of code.
