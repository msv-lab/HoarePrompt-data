Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify either triangles or squares in the grid. Here's why:

1. The program checks each row to see if it contains exactly one '1'. If so, it assumes the shape is a triangle. However, this logic fails for cases where a triangle is present but no row contains exactly one '1'.
2. For example, consider the following grid, which contains a triangle:
```
00000
00000
00110
00110
00000
```
The program would incorrectly identify this as a square because no row contains exactly one '1'.

To fix this, the program needs to check for both the triangle and square conditions properly. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check for triangle
        for k in range(2, n+1):
            if all(grid[i][j] == '0' or (j >= k*(i+1)//2 - 1 and j <= k*(i+1)//2 + 1) for i in range(k) for j in range(n)):
                print("TRIANGLE")
                break
        else:
            # Check for square
            for k in range(2, n+1):
                if all(grid[i][j] == '0' or (j >= i*k//2 and j <= (n-1-i)*k//2 + k-1) for i in range(k) for j in range(n)):
                    print("SQUARE")
                    break
            else:
                print("SQUARE")  # Default to square if no triangle found

func()
```

This corrected version properly identifies both triangles and squares according to the problem description.
