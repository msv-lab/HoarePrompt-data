The function processes a series of grids, each represented as a list of n strings containing '0's and '1's. It determines whether each grid contains a single triangle or a single square that includes all '1's. Based on this determination, it prints either 'TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE' for each grid. If any row in a grid has exactly one '1', it prints 'TRIANGLE'; otherwise, it prints 'SQUARE'.
