You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of grids, each represented as a list of n strings containing '0's and '1's. It determines whether each grid contains a single triangle or a single square that includes all '1's. Based on this determination, it prints either 'TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE' for each grid. If any row in a grid has exactly one '1', it prints 'TRIANGLE'; otherwise, it prints 'SQUARE'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly identifies whether the shape in the grid is a triangle or a square.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.
   
2. **Identifying Shapes:**
   - The program initializes two variables `a` and `b`. 
     - `a` is used to store the result if a triangle is found.
     - `b` is used to store the result if a square is found.
   - For each row in the grid, it checks the number of `1`s:
     - If a row contains exactly one `1`, it sets `a` to `'TRIANGLE'`.
     - If a row contains more than one `1`, it sets `b` to `'SQUARE'`.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all rows, the program prints the value of `a` if it is non-zero, otherwise it prints the value of `b`.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Triangles:**
   - The program checks if a row contains exactly one `1` to identify a triangle. However, this is not sufficient to identify a triangle. A triangle can have multiple rows with more than one `1`, as long as they form a triangular pattern.
   - For example, consider a grid with a triangle of size `k=3`:
     ```
     000
     011
     011
     ```
     The second and third rows both contain two `1`s, but the entire shape is still a triangle.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Squares:**
   - The program checks if a row contains more than one `1` to identify a square. This is also not sufficient because a square can have rows with only one `1` if the `1`s are aligned properly.
   - For example, consider a grid with a square of size `k=3`:
     ```
     000
     011
     011
     ```
     The second and third rows both contain two `1`s, but the entire shape is still a square.

3. **Incomplete Logic:**
   - The program does not check the actual pattern of `1`s to ensure they form a triangle or a square. It only checks the count of `1`s in each row, which is insufficient for determining the shape.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues with the logic for identifying triangles and squares, the provided program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
