State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(t):`.
2. The variable `i` is the loop variable, and it starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
3. The variable `t` is used as the upper bound for the range function, meaning the loop will run `t` times if `t` is a positive integer.
4. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
5. At the start of the loop, the value of `i` should be 0 because that's the initial value before the first iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0.
