Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. Here's why:

1. **Triangle Identification**: The program checks if any row contains exactly one '1'. If so, it incorrectly assumes the shape is a triangle. However, this is not sufficient to determine a triangle. A triangle must have a specific pattern of '1's across multiple rows.

2. **Square Identification**: The program checks if any row contains more than one '1'. If so, it assumes the shape is a square. This is also incorrect because it doesn't account for the specific pattern required for a square.

3. **Pattern Check**: Neither the triangle nor the square is properly checked for their specific patterns. For example, a triangle should have rows with increasing odd numbers of '1's centered in a column, and a square should have rows with equal numbers of '1's centered horizontally.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def check_triangle(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    for i in range(1, n):
        if len([j for j in range(n) if grid[i][j] == '1']) != 2 * i - 1:
            return False
    return True

def check_square(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    for i in range(1, n):
        if len([j for j in range(n) if grid[i][j] == '1']) != n:
            return False
    return True

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check for triangle
        if check_triangle(grid):
            print("TRIANGLE")
        # Check for square
        elif check_square(grid):
            print("SQUARE")
        else:
            print("NO SHAPE")

func()
```

This version correctly checks for the specific patterns of a triangle and a square by iterating through the grid and counting the number of '1's in each row and column.
