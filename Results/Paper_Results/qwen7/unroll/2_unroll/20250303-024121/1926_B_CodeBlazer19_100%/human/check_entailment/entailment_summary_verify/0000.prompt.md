You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4b06bb9ff8f408edc96077ace0d5e299065a3c50.png)
Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) â€” the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) â€” the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

        n = int(input())
        a = 0
        b = ''
        for j in range(n):
            s = input()
            if s.count('1') == 1:
                a = 'TRIANGLE'
            elif s.count('1') > 1:
                b = 'SQUARE'
        if a != 0:
            print(a)
        else:
            print(b)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of grids, each represented as a list of n strings containing '0's and '1's. It determines whether each grid contains a single triangle or a single square that includes all '1's. Based on this determination, it prints either 'TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE' for each grid. If any row in a grid has exactly one '1', it prints 'TRIANGLE'; otherwise, it prints 'SQUARE'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify either triangles or squares in the grid. Here's why:

1. The program checks each row to see if it contains exactly one '1'. If so, it assumes the shape is a triangle. However, this logic fails for cases where a triangle is present but no row contains exactly one '1'.
2. For example, consider the following grid, which contains a triangle:
```
00000
00000
00110
00110
00000
```
The program would incorrectly identify this as a square because no row contains exactly one '1'.

To fix this, the program needs to check for both the triangle and square conditions properly. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check for triangle
        for k in range(2, n+1):
            if all(grid[i][j] == '0' or (j >= k*(i+1)//2 - 1 and j <= k*(i+1)//2 + 1) for i in range(k) for j in range(n)):
                print("TRIANGLE")
                break
        else:
            # Check for square
            for k in range(2, n+1):
                if all(grid[i][j] == '0' or (j >= i*k//2 and j <= (n-1-i)*k//2 + k-1) for i in range(k) for j in range(n)):
                    print("SQUARE")
                    break
            else:
                print("SQUARE")  # Default to square if no triangle found

func()
```

This corrected version properly identifies both triangles and squares according to the problem description.
