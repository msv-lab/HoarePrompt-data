### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program and the problem statement to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
- The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's in the grid.
- A triangle consists of k consecutive rows with 2*i-1 ones in the i-th row, centered in one column.
- A square consists of k consecutive rows with k ones, equally spaced from the left edge of the grid.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.

2. **Identifying Shapes:**
   - The program initializes two variables `a` and `b` to store the results for triangle and square respectively.
   - For each row in the grid, it checks the number of `1`s:
     - If a row contains exactly one `1`, it sets `a` to `'TRIANGLE'`.
     - If a row contains more than one `1`, it sets `b` to `'SQUARE'`.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all rows, the program prints the value of `a` if it is non-zero, otherwise it prints the value of `b`.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Triangles:**
   - The program incorrectly assumes that a row with exactly one `1` indicates a triangle. This is not sufficient because a triangle can have multiple rows with more than one `1`, as long as they form a triangular pattern.
   - For example, a triangle of size `k=3`:
     ```
     000
     011
     011
     ```
     Here, the second and third rows both contain two `1`s, but the entire shape is still a triangle.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Squares:**
   - The program incorrectly assumes that a row with more than one `1` indicates a square. This is not sufficient because a square can have rows with only one `1` if the `1`s are aligned properly.
   - For example, a square of size `k=3`:
     ```
     000
     011
     011
     ```
     Here, the second and third rows both contain two `1`s, but the entire shape is still a square.

3. **Incomplete Logic:**
   - The program does not check the actual pattern of `1`s to ensure they form a triangle or a square. It only checks the count of `1`s in each row, which is insufficient for determining the shape.

#### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the logic for identifying triangles and squares, the provided program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
**False**

The program fails to correctly identify the shapes due to the flawed logic in checking the counts of `1`s in each row without verifying the actual pattern of the `1`s forming the shapes.
