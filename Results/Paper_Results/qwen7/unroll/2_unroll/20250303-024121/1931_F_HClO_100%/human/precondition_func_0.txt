t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n⋅k ≤ 2⋅10^5. Each test case consists of k lines, where the i-th line contains n integers a_{ij} representing the order of participants shown to the participant a_{i0}, and a_{i0} is always the first participant in that order. All integers a_{ij} are unique and range from 1 to n. The sum of n⋅k across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
