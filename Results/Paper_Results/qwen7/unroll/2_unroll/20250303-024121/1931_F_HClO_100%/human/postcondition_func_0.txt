The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of positive integers n and k, followed by k lines of n unique integers. It checks if the sequences represented by these integers can be transformed into each other by inserting specific elements. If all test cases satisfy the transformation condition, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'.
