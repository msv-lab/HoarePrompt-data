Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Handling**: The function correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop to process each one individually.
2. **Initial Conditions Check**: For the case where `m` (the number of screenshots) is 1, the function correctly prints 'yes' without further checks, which aligns with the problem statement.
3. **Comparison of Screenshot Orders**: The function compares the orders of participants in the first two screenshots (`a1` and `a2`) and removes the respective author from both lists. This step ensures that the comparison is fair and not influenced by the author's position.
4. **Consistency Check**: The function then checks if the remaining parts of the two lists are identical. If they are, it proceeds to check subsequent screenshots. If they are not, it prints 'no'.
5. **Insertion Logic**: The function uses the positions of the author in the first two screenshots to determine where to insert the author in the other screenshots. This logic seems to handle most cases correctly.
6. **Final Validation**: After processing all screenshots, the function validates if the final list matches the expected order for all screenshots. If any discrepancy is found, it prints 'no'; otherwise, it prints 'yes'.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the initial conditions, compares the screenshots, and performs the necessary checks to determine if a consistent order exists.

Correctness: **True**
