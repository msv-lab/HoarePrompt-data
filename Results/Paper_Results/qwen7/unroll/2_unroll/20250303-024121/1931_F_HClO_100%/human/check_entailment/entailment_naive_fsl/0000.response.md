Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to correctly validate the order of participants for all screenshots when the initial orders do not match after the first two comparisons. 

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
3
4 4
1 2 3 4
2 3 1 4
3 2 1 4
4 2 3 1
6 2
1 3 5 2 4 6
6 3 5 2 1 4
3 3
1 2 3
2 3 1
3 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
YES
YES
```

However, the provided program outputs:
```
YES
YES
NO
```

This discrepancy occurs because the program incorrectly assumes that if the first two screenshots do not match, the subsequent screenshots cannot be valid. The program should instead check if the remaining screenshots are consistent with the derived order from the first two screenshots. This is not handled correctly in the provided solution, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
