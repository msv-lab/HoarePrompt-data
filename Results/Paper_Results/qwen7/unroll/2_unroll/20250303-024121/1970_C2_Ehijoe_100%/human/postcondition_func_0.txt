The function accepts a dictionary `nodes`, an integer `start`, and an integer `parent` (with a default value of None). It checks if the starting node has only one neighbor which is its parent, in which case it returns False. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself for each neighbor of the starting node (excluding the parent), collecting the results in a list `distances`. Finally, it returns True if any element in `distances` is True, otherwise it returns False.
