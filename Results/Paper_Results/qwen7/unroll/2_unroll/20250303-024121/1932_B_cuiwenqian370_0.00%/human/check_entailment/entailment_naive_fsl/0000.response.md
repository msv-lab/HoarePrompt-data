Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not follow the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to calculate the year in which all \(n\) signs of the apocalypse will occur, given their periodicities. However, the provided code includes two functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) that do not relate to the problem at hand. 

- `func_1` seems to be related to processing a string with `@` and `*` characters, which is unrelated to the problem of calculating the year of the apocalypse.
- `func_2` reads input and calls `func_1`, but again, this is not relevant to the problem description.

Since the code does not implement the required functionality, it is incorrect.
