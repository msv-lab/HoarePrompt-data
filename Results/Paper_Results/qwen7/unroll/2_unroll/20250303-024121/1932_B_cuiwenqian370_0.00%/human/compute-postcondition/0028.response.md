Output State: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, and the length of `path` is `n`; `dp` is a list of length `n`, with all elements updated according to the rules defined in the loop. Specifically, `dp[0]` is either 1 or -inf depending on the first character of `path`; `dp[1]` is -inf if the second character of `path` is '*', otherwise `dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)`. For each index `i` from 2 to `n-1`:
- If `path[i]` is '*', then `dp[i]` is set to -inf.
- Otherwise, `dp[i]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]` plus 1 if `path[i]` is '@', or 0 if `path[i]` is '*'.
