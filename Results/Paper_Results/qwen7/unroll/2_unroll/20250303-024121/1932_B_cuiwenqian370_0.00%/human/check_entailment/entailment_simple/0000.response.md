Reasoning:
1. The provided code does not match the problem description. The problem describes a scenario involving the occurrence of signs of the apocalypse over years, but the annotated program defines two functions that do not relate to this scenario. Instead, it deals with a string processing problem involving `@` and `*` characters.
2. The first function `func_1` processes a string `path` consisting of `@` and `*` characters and computes a dynamic programming array `dp`. However, the logic and purpose of this function do not align with the problem's requirements.
3. The second function `func_2` reads input and calls `func_1` on each string in the input, but again, the input format and the expected output do not match the problem's requirements.

Given that the provided code does not solve the problem described, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
