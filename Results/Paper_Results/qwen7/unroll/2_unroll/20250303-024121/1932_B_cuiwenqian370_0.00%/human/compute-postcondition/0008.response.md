Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for result in results:`. The variables involved here are `result` and `results`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `results` is a list containing `t` elements where each element is the result of `func_1(path)` for each `path` in `data` starting from the `t+1`th element to the end of the list.
   - `result` is the variable that will take on the values from the `results` list one by one during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the `results` list. Therefore, the loop will start executing if `results` is not empty.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that `results` is not empty when the loop starts.
   - Since `result` is just a temporary variable that takes on the values from `results`, we don't need to adjust its initial state directly.

Given the above points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the state of `results`. Specifically, `results` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

**State:**
**`t` is an integer, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `2 * t`, `results` is a list containing at least one element where each element is the result of `func_1(path)` for each `path` in `data` starting from the `t+1`th element to the end of the list.**
