Postcondition: **`path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, and the length of `path` is not 0; `dp` is a list of length equal to the length of `path`, with all elements initialized to 0; `dp[0]` is either 1 or -inf depending on the first character of `path`; `dp[1]` is -inf if the second character of `path` is '*', otherwise `dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)`**.

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, considering the initial state described in the precondition and the changes made by each part of the if-else block.
