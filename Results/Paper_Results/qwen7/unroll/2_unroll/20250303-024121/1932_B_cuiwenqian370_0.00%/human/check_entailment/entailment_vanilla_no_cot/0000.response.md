Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not relate to the problem statement at all. Instead of calculating the year when all signs of the apocalypse will occur, the code seems to be dealing with some kind of dynamic programming problem involving characters '@' and '*', which is unrelated to the given problem.

To solve the actual problem, you would need to implement a function that calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities of the signs, as the LCM will give the year when all signs will occur sequentially. Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def find_apocalypse_year(n, periodicities):
    current_year = 1
    for period in periodicities:
        current_year = lcm(current_year, period)
    return current_year

def solve_test_cases():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[1])
        periodicities = list(map(int, data[2:n+2]))
        results.append(find_apocalypse_year(n, periodicities))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
solve_test_cases()
```

This code defines a function `find_apocalypse_year` that calculates the LCM of the periodicities to find the year when all signs will occur. It then reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the result.
