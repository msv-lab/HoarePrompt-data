Reasoning:
1. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to process a string `path` consisting of `@` and `*` characters and compute a specific value using dynamic programming.
   - However, the problem description does not mention any string processing or dynamic programming approach. Instead, it requires finding the year when all signs will occur sequentially based on their periodicities.
   - The function `func_1` does not seem to be relevant to solving the problem as described.

2. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly extracts the number of test cases (`t`), the number of signs (`n`), and the periodicities of the signs for each test case.
   - However, instead of computing the year when all signs will occur sequentially, it calls `func_1` which is irrelevant to the problem. This function should calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities to find the year when all signs will occur.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem, we need to find the LCM of the periodicities of the signs.
   - The LCM of a set of numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of each of the numbers in the set.
   - We can use the `math.lcm` function available in Python 3.9 and later to find the LCM of the periodicities.

Given the analysis, the provided functions do not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
