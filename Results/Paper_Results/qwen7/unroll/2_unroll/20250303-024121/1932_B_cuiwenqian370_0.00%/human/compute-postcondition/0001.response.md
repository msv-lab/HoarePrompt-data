Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using spaces.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from the standard input (which would be provided by `sys.stdin.read`), splits it into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters, and assigns this list to the variable `data`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and it still represents the number of test cases.
