You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . Output a 2n \times 2n checkerboard made of 2
\times 2 squares alternating '\texttt{#} ' and '\texttt{.} ', with the top-
left cell being '\texttt{#} '.

The picture above shows the answers for n=1,2,3,4 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 20 ) — the number of test
cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20
) — it means you need to output a checkerboard of side length 2n .

Output

For each test case, output 2n lines, each containing 2n characters without
spaces — the checkerboard, as described in the statement. Do not output empty
lines between test cases.

    casos = int(input())
    for c in range(0, casos):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('##')
            print('##')
        elif n == 2:
            print('##..')
            print('##..')
            print('..##')
            print('..##')
        elif n == 3:
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
            print('..##..')
            print('..##..')
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
        elif n == 4:
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')

            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')

        else:
            print('No esta en el rango')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.
def func():
    casos = int(input())
    for c in range(0, casos):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print('##')
            print('##')
        elif n == 2:
            print('##..')

    #State: Output State: The output will consist of multiple patterns printed based on the value of `n` for each iteration of the loop. If `n` is 1, two lines of "##" will be printed. If `n` is 2, four lines of specific patterns will be printed. If `n` is 3, six lines of specific patterns will be printed. If `n` is 4, eight lines of specific patterns will be printed. If `n` is greater than 4, the message "No esta en el rango" (which means "Not in the range") will be printed for each case outside the specified range. The total number of these patterns will depend on the value of `casos`, which is the number of times the loop runs.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The problem requires generating a 2n x 2n checkerboard pattern where each 2x2 block alternates between `#` and `.`.
2. The given solution only handles specific cases for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4`. It does not provide a general solution for any `n` within the specified range.
3. For `n > 4`, the program incorrectly prints "No esta en el rango" which translates to "It is not in the range". This is incorrect because the problem specifies that `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`.
4. The solution should use a loop to generate the pattern for any `n` within the given range.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible values of `n` and does not follow the required pattern for larger values of `n`.

Correctness: **False**
