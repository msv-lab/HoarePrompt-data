Output State: The output will consist of multiple patterns printed based on the value of `n` for each iteration of the loop. Specifically, for each `c` in the range from 0 to `casos-1`, if `n` is 1, two lines of "##" will be printed; if `n` is 2, four lines with specific patterns will be printed; if `n` is 3, six lines with specific patterns will be printed; if `n` is 4, eight lines with specific patterns will be printed; otherwise, "No esta en el rango" (which means "Not in the range") will be printed. Each pattern is repeated for the number of times specified by `n`.
