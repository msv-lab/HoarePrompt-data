Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i; `r` is a lambda function that returns a map of integers from the input split.**

The code defines a lambda function `r` that reads input and splits it into integers, but it does not execute any operations that would change the values of the existing variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `x_i`, `y_i`). Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged, and the only new piece of information is the definition of the lambda function `r`.
