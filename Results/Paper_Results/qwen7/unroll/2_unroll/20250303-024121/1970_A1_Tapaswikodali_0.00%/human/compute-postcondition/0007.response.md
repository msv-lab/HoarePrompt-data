Output State: **`s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `balance` is 0; `details` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains the current value of `balance`, the negative index of the character in `s`, and the character itself; `result` is a string that concatenates all characters from `details` in the order of their appearance in `s`.**

Explanation: The code `result = ''.join(char for _, _, char in details)` does not change the values of `s`, `balance`, or `details`. Instead, it creates a new string `result` by joining all the characters from the tuples in `details`. Since `details` is a sorted list of tuples containing the current value of `balance`, the negative index of the character in `s`, and the character itself, `result` will be a string that concatenates all these characters in the order they appear in `s`.
