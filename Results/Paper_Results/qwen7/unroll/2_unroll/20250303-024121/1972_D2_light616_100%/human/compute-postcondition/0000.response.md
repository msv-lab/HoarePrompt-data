Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6 and the square root of n is less than or equal to the maximum possible value derived from the conditions (x + y) * x ≤ n and (x + y) * y ≤ m for all valid pairs (x, y); `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6; `x` is 1.**

In this case, the variable `x` is explicitly set to 1. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state, and the condition regarding the square root of `n` and the constraints involving `x` and `y` remains valid.
