Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball according to the given rules. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not accurately calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query.

Let's consider a simple example to illustrate the issue:

For the input:
```
3
3
>><
```

The expected output is:
```
3 3 3
```

However, running the provided code gives different results. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the code is incorrect:

1. The function `func_1` is used to calculate the difference between two indices, but it is not used correctly in the context of calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.
2. The logic in `func_2` does not properly handle the inversion of the characters and the calculation of the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.

To verify this, let's manually simulate the pinball movement for the example input `>><`:

- For the first cell (`i=1`), the pinball starts at position 1, moves right to position 2, and then moves left to position 1 again, taking 3 seconds to leave the grid.
- For the second cell (`i=2`), the pinball starts at position 2, moves left to position 1, and then moves right to position 2 again, taking 3 seconds to leave the grid.
- For the third cell (`i=3`), the pinball starts at position 3, moves left to position 2, and then moves right to position 3 again, taking 3 seconds to leave the grid.

The provided code does not correctly simulate these movements and calculations, leading to incorrect outputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
