The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `s1`, which is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n`, which is the length of the string `s1`. The length of `s1` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s1` and its length `n`, and returns based on the balance of '<' and '>' characters in the string.**
