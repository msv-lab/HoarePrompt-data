Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that the price increase applies to all subsequent days after purchasing tickets on a given day. Instead, the program incorrectly calculates the cost by subtracting a quadratic term (`s * s / 2`) which does not reflect the actual price increase mechanism described in the problem statement.

For example, consider the following input:
- `n = 4`, `m = 2`, `k = 3`
- `a = [8, 6, 4, 2]`

The correct approach would involve dynamically adjusting the price increases for each day based on the number of tickets purchased. The current implementation does not properly handle this dynamic adjustment and thus will produce incorrect results.

Hereâ€™s a brief outline of how the correct solution should work:
1. Iterate through each day.
2. Determine the maximum number of tickets that can be bought on the current day without exceeding the remaining tickets to be bought.
3. Calculate the total cost for the tickets bought on the current day and adjust the prices for subsequent days accordingly.
4. Repeat until all tickets are bought.

The provided program fails to accurately simulate these steps, leading to incorrect results for many potential cases.
