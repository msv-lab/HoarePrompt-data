Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. After executing the loop, c is the sum of the expression \(l[i] \times s - \frac{s \times s}{2}\) for all 0 ≤ i < n, where s is the minimum of m and k after decrementing k by the value of s in each iteration.
