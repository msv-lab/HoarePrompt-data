Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer t indicating the number of test cases, followed by a positive integer n and a list of n integers representing the number of stones in each pile. For each test case, it calculates the smallest non-negative integer not present in the sorted list of stones (`mexsize`) and compares it with the maximum value in the list (`maxsize`). Based on the comparison and the parity of `mexsize`, it prints either "Alice" or "Bob" for each test case.**
