Output State: **`s1` is an empty string, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 26` and `1 <= k <= 26`, `s2` is an empty string, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.**

Explanation: The code creates a set named `alphabet` which contains the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. This set is constructed using a set comprehension that iterates over the range from 97 to 97 + `k` (inclusive), converting each integer to its corresponding character using `chr()`. The values of `s1`, `s`, `n`, and `s2` remain unchanged.
