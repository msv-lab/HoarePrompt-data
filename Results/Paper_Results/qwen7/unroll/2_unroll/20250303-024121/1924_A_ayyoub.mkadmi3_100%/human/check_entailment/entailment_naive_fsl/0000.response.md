Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the string `s` is too short to contain all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are checked against the string `s`.

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3 3 8
  abcabcabc
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  YES
  ```

However, the program will output:
- Output:
  ```
  NO
  aa
  ```

This happens because the function `func_1` does not correctly generate all possible subsequences of length `n` and check them against the string `s`. The function `func_1` only checks if the string `s` contains enough characters to form all possible subsequences but does not verify the subsequences themselves.

To fix this, the program needs to generate all possible subsequences of length `n` and check if each one is a subsequence of `s`. The current implementation does not do this, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
