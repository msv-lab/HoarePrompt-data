#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets, k and n are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26.
def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i

            s1 += i
        
    #State: Output State: `s1` is a string containing all characters from `s` that are in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, except one character if `len(alphabet)` is 1, `s2` is a string containing the single character from `s` that is in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets if `len(alphabet)` is 1, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
    r = len(s1) // k
    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #A boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` and going to the end, and the string `s2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: a string `s`, a positive integer `k`, and another positive integer `n`. It processes `s` to create two strings, `s1` and `s2`. `s1` contains all characters from `s` that belong to the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, while `s2` contains a single character from `s` if there is exactly one character in the first `k` alphabets that is present in `s`. The function then calculates a value `r` based on the length of `s1` and returns a tuple consisting of a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and the string `s2`.
