Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case involving a positive integer `t`, a list of `n` positive integers `c`, and `q` queries defined by pairs of integers `l_i` and `r_i`. For each query, it checks the sum of elements in the sublist from index `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive) of list `c` and returns the count of queries for which the sum is even.**
