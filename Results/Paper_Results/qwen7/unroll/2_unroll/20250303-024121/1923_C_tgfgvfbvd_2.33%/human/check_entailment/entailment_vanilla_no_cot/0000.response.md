Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem but has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Subarray Sum Calculation**: The program calculates prefix sums (`p`), which is a good start. However, it incorrectly checks if the subarray sum `s` is greater than or equal to `2 * (b - a + 1)` to determine if the subarray is "good". This condition is not sufficient to ensure the subarray is good according to the problem statement.

2. **Conditions for a Good Subarray**: A subarray is good if:
   - There exists another subarray with the same sum.
   - All elements in the subarray are different from their counterparts in the other subarray.
   - All elements in the other subarray are positive.

3. **Incorrect Logic**: The current logic only checks if the sum of the subarray is large enough, which does not guarantee the existence of another subarray with the same sum and different elements.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to implement a more sophisticated approach to check if a subarray can be transformed into another subarray meeting the criteria. One possible approach involves using a combination of prefix sums and additional data structures to track potential transformations.

Here is a revised version of the solution that addresses these issues:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def is_good_subarray(l, a, b):
    subarray_sum = sum(l[a-1:b])
    # Check if the subarray can be transformed into another subarray with the same sum
    # and different elements while ensuring all elements are positive
    if subarray_sum < 2 * (b - a + 1):
        return False
    # Use a dictionary to track the frequency of elements in the subarray
    freq = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(a-1, b):
        freq[l[i]] += 1
        if freq[l[i]] > 1:
            return False
    return True

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        for _ in range(q):
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            if is_good_subarray(l, a, b):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

This solution uses a dictionary to track the frequency of elements in the subarray and ensures that no element appears more than once, which is necessary for the subarray to be "good".
