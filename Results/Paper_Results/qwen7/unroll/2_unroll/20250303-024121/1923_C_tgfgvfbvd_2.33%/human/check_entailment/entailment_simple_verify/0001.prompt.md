You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    #State: Output State: The program will execute a series of test cases. For each test case, it will first read two integers \(n\) and \(m\), then a list of \(n\) integers \(l\). It will compute a prefix sum list \(p\) from the list \(l\). Then, for each of the \(m\) queries, it will read two integers \(a\) and \(b\), and determine whether the sum of elements in the sublist \(l_{a-1}\) to \(l_{b-1}\) is at least twice the length of the sublist. If so, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases and queries, the output consists of 'YES' or 'NO' for each query across all test cases.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine if a subarray is "good" based on specific conditions.
   - A subarray \(c[l_i], c[l_i+1], \ldots, c[r_i]\) is "good" if there exists another array \(b\) of the same length such that:
     - The sums of elements in both arrays are equal.
     - All elements in \(a\) and \(b\) are different.
     - All elements in \(b\) are positive.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `l` and computes prefix sums in the list `p`.
   - For each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray using the prefix sums and checks if the subarray can be "good".

3. **Key Points**:
   - The condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` is used to check if the sum of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray. This is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the subarray to be "good".
   - The condition `b - a + 1 > 1` ensures that the subarray has more than one element.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The code correctly computes the prefix sums.
   - The logic for checking the subarray sum is correct but incomplete. It only checks if the sum is at least twice the length of the subarray, which is a necessary condition but not sufficient.
   - The code does not ensure that all elements in the subarray can be rearranged to satisfy the other conditions (all elements different, all positive).

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the example provided, the subarray `[1, 2, 1, 4, 5]` is checked with different ranges.
   - The subarray `[1, 2, 1, 4, 5]` has a sum of 13. The code correctly identifies that a subarray with a sum of 13 and length 5 cannot be "good" because 13 is not at least twice 5 (which would be 10).

### Conclusion:
The given code does not fully implement the logic required to determine if a subarray is "good". While it correctly checks the sum condition, it does not verify the other necessary conditions (all elements different, all positive). Therefore, the code is not correct for the given problem.

### Correctness:
**False**
