Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1()` does not correctly solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the input as a list of integers, which is incorrect because the input is a binary string. The input should be read as a string and then converted to a list of characters or a list of integers representing '0' and '1'.

2. **Logic for Calculating Minimum Cost**: The logic in the function does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. Specifically, the logic for counting zeros and calculating the answer does not align with the problem statement. The problem requires finding the minimum cost to sort the string, but the current implementation seems to count something different.

3. **Output**: The output of the function is the sum of counts calculated based on the conditions provided within the loop, which does not correspond to the problem's requirement of finding the minimum total cost to make the string sorted.

Given these issues, the function does not solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
