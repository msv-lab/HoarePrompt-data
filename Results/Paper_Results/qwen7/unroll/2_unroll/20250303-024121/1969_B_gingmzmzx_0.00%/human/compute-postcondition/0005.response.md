Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a binary string `s`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `ans` based on the count of zeros and ones in the string. Specifically, `ans` is determined by counting the number of positions where a zero is followed by a one or the number of ones that are not immediately preceded by a zero.**
