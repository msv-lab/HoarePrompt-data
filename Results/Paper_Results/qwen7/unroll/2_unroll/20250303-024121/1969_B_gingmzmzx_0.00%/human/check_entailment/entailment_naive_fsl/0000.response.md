Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The program seems to be counting the number of inversions in the string but does not account for the cost of cyclic shifts.

For example, consider the input string `101011`. The program would output `5`, but the correct minimum total cost is `9` as shown in the example note. The program does not handle the logic of performing cyclic shifts to minimize the cost, which is required by the problem description.
