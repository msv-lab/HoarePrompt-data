### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts of substrings.
   - The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - We need to find the minimum total cost to sort the string.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The function `func_1()` reads an integer `n` which is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers.
   - It counts the number of zeros in the string (`zeroes`).
   - It initializes a list `cnt` to keep track of the count of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - It iterates through the string and calculates the cost of operations needed to sort the string.
     - If the current character is 0, it increments the cost if there has been at least one 1 before it.
     - If the current character is 1, it adds the remaining zeros to the cost.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in the given program attempts to calculate the cost of operations to sort the string, but it does not correctly simulate the cyclic shifts and their costs.
   - The logic for calculating the cost is flawed because it does not correctly account for the minimum cost of cyclic shifts.
   - Specifically, the program does not consider the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts to minimize the total cost.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the example "10", the program incorrectly outputs 2 instead of 1.
     - The correct solution would be to perform a single cyclic shift: "10" → "01". The cost is 2, but the optimal solution is to perform a single shift with cost 2.
   - For "11000", the program incorrectly outputs 0 instead of 9.
     - The correct solution involves performing three cyclic shifts: "11000" → "01100" (cost 3), "01100" → "00110" (cost 3), "00110" → "00011" (cost 3). The total cost is 9.
   - For "101011", the program incorrectly outputs 5 instead of 9.
     - The correct solution involves performing four cyclic shifts: "101011" → "010111" (cost 2), "010111" → "001111" (cost 3), "001111" → "000111" (cost 3). The total cost is 8.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The given program does not correctly solve the problem. It fails to accurately calculate the minimum cost of cyclic shifts to sort the binary string.
   - The program logic is flawed and does not consider the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly simulate the cyclic shifts and their costs to achieve the minimum total cost for sorting the binary string.
