Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, it counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s`. If the count of 'U' is odd, it appends 'YES' to the results; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. Finally, it prints each result in the list.**
