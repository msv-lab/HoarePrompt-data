Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[index]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", `index` is 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[index]` to `t`. Since `index` was initially 0, it now becomes 1 after the assignment. All other variables remain unchanged.
