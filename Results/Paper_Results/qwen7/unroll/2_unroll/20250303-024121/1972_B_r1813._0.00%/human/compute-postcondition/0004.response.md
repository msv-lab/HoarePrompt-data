Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[index]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", `index` is 2.**

The code increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` was set to 1. After executing `index += 1`, the new value of `index` is 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
