Output State: **`costs` is a list of length `n` where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each corresponding row in `rows`; `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` retain their original integer values with the constraints 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 100, 3 ≤ `m` ≤ 2 × 10^5, and 1 ≤ `d` ≤ `m`; `rows` is a list of `n` lists, each containing integers; `total_costs` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `total_costs`. This does not affect the values of `costs`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, or any other variables. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
