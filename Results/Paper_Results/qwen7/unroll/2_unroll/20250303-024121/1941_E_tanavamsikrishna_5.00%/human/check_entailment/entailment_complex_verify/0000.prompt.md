You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is
that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his
friend solve this problem.

The river is a grid of n rows and m columns. The intersection of the i -th row
and the j -th column contains the number a_{i,j} — the depth in the
corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the
river banks, so the depth for them is 0 .

The river may look like this.

Rudolf can choose the row (i,1), (i,2), \ldots, (i,m) and build a bridge over
it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost
of installing a support in the cell (i,j) is a_{i,j}+1 . Supports must be
installed so that the following conditions are met:

  1. A support must be installed in cell (i,1) ; 
  2. A support must be installed in cell (i,m) ; 
  3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d . The distance between supports (i, j_1) and (i, j_2) is |j_1 - j_2| - 1 . 

Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k
bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i (1 \le i
\le n - k + 1 ) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i, i + 1,
\ldots, i + k - 1 . Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing
supports.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , m , k , and d (1
\le k \le n \le 100 , 3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le d \le m ) — the number
of rows and columns of the field, the number of bridges, and the maximum
distance between supports.

Then follow n lines, i -th line contains m positive integers a_{i, j} (0 \le
a_{i, j} \le 10^6 , a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 ) — the depths of the river cells.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot m for all sets of input data does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum total cost of
supports installation.

Note

In the first test case, it is most profitable to build a bridge on the second
row.

It is not a top view, but side view: gray cells — bridge itself, white cells
are empty, black cells — supports, blue cells — water, brown cells — river
bottom.

In the second test case, it is most profitable to build bridges on the second
and third rows. The supports will be placed in cells (2, 3) , (3, 2) , and on
the river banks.

In the third test case the supports can be placed along the river banks.

        row[i] = row[i] + 1

    return row[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the list 'row', which is the minimum value among the last d+1 elements of the list, plus its original value plus 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `row` and a positive integer `d`. It increments the first `d-1` elements of `row` by 1, then sets each subsequent element to the minimum value among the previous `d+1` elements plus its original value plus 1. Finally, it returns the last element of the modified `row`, which is the minimum value among the last `d+1` elements of the list, plus its original value plus 1.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, m, k, d) are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. rows is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains m positive integers representing the depths of the river cells, and the first and last elements of each inner list are 0. The sum of n × m for all sets of input data does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
def func_2():
    n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
        
    #State: Output State: `total_costs` is a list of length `n - (k - 1)` where each element is the sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list. The initial `costs` list and other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`) retain their original values, and `total_costs` is populated with these sums.
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: min(total_costs) (where total_costs is a list of length n - (k - 1) containing the sums of k consecutive elements from the costs list)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters (n, m, k, d) and a list of n lists (rows). It calculates the sum of k consecutive elements from the costs list, which is derived from the input rows list using the parameter d. The function then finds the minimum value among these sums and prints it. The final state of the program includes the original values of n, m, k, d, and rows, while introducing a new list called total_costs containing the calculated sums.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not correctly handle the logic for calculating the cost of supports for each row. The function seems to be intended to calculate the cost for a single row, but it does not properly account for the constraints that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 4 1 2
0 1 2 0
0 2 1 0
0 1 2 0
```
The expected output should be 4, as the minimum cost for the first row is 2 (since we need to place supports at positions 1 and 3, which are 2 units apart). However, the provided function `func_1` does not correctly calculate this cost.

The function `func_1` should iterate through the row and calculate the cost of placing supports such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`. It should also ensure that supports are placed in the first and last columns, which are always 0.

Here's a corrected version of the `func_1` function:
```python
def func_1(row: List[int], d: int):
    supports = [1]  # Support at the first column
    max_cost = 0
    for i in range(1, len(row) - 1):
        if i - supports[-1] <= d:
            supports.append(i)
        else:
            max_cost += min(row[supports[-1]:i]) + 1
            supports.append(i)
    max_cost += row[-1] + 1  # Support at the last column
    return max_cost
```

This corrected function ensures that supports are placed according to the constraints and calculates the minimum cost correctly.
