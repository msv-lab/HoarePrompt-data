The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `row` and a positive integer `d`. It increments the first `d-1` elements of `row` by 1, then sets each subsequent element to the minimum value among the previous `d+1` elements plus its original value plus 1. Finally, it returns the last element of the modified `row`, which is the minimum value among the last `d+1` elements of the list, plus its original value plus 1.
