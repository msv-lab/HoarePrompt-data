### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**: The function starts by incrementing the first `d-1` elements of the row by 1.
2. **Dynamic Programming Update**: For each subsequent element in the row, starting from index `d-1`, the function updates the cost by taking the minimum cost of the previous `d+1` elements and adding 1 to the current element's depth.

This ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is at most `d`. The final value returned by the function is the cost of the last element in the row, which is the minimum cost among the last `d+1` elements plus 1.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Input Reading**: The function reads the dimensions of the river grid (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`) and the depths of each cell in the grid.
2. **Cost Calculation**: It applies `func_1` to each row to calculate the cost of installing supports.
3. **Total Cost Calculation**: It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.

The logic here is sound:
- The cost calculation for each row is correct due to the dynamic programming approach used in `func_1`.
- The total cost calculation considers all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the first and last columns having a depth of 0.
   - The distance constraint is enforced correctly through the dynamic programming update.

2. **Algorithm Validity**:
   - The algorithm uses dynamic programming to ensure the distance constraint is met.
   - The algorithm iterates over all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.

3. **Input Validation**:
   - The function assumes valid inputs as per the problem description.

#### Annotated Code Verification:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
- The logic in `func_1` and `func_2` aligns with the problem requirements and the annotations.

### Conclusion:
Based on the detailed analysis and the annotations, the program correctly solves the problem as described. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
