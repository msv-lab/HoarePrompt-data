### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Given Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)
```

#### Key Points to Check:
1. **Initialization**: The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`.
2. **Loop Over `b`**: The loop iterates over `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`.
3. **Update `ans`**: Inside the loop, `ans` is updated by adding \((n + b) // (b * b)\).

#### Issues Identified:
- The update of `ans` with \((n + b) // (b * b)\) does not account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The program does not iterate over all possible values of \(a\) within the range \([1, n]\) for each \(b\).
- The program does not check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for each pair \((a, b)\).

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within their respective ranges.
2. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
3. Count the number of pairs that satisfy this condition.

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
