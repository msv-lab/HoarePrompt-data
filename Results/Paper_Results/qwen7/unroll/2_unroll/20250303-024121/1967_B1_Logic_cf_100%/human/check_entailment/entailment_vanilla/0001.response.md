Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes `ans` to `n`, which seems to be an attempt to count valid pairs.

3. **Loop Over Possible Values of `b`:**
   - The loop iterates over possible values of `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`.
   - Inside the loop, it updates `ans` using the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)`.

### Key Points to Check

1. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The condition `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - For a fixed `b`, we need to check how many `a` satisfy this condition within the range `[1, n]`.

2. **Expression `(n + b) // (b * b)`:**
   - This expression does not correctly implement the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - It simply adds `b` to `n` and divides by `b * b`, which is not related to the actual condition.

3. **GCD Calculation:**
   - The program does not calculate the GCD of `a` and `b` for each pair `(a, b)`, which is necessary to check the condition properly.

### Example Verification

Let's verify with the example provided:

- For the test case `10 8`:
  - The expected output is `14`.
  - The program's logic does not correctly count the valid pairs.

### Correct Implementation

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check if they satisfy the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, min(a, m) + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
