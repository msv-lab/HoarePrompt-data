Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The key issue lies in the formula used to calculate `ans`. According to the problem statement, we need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the provided code snippet calculates `ans` using the formula `(n + b) // (b * b)` which is not related to the problem's constraints. This formula does not account for the condition that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

A correct approach would involve iterating through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within their respective ranges and checking if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds true.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
