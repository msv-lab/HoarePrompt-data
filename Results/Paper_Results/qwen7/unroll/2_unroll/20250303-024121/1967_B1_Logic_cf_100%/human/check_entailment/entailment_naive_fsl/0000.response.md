Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. According to the problem description, we need to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the program calculates `ans` as `n` and then adds `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`. This calculation does not account for the condition that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be attempting to count something related to the divisors of `b`, which is not relevant to the problem.

To illustrate this, consider the test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\):

- The expected output is 14, but the program's output is incorrect.

Here is a counterexample:
- For \(a = 2\) and \(b = 2\), the condition \(2 + 2\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2)\) (which is true since \(4\) is a multiple of \(4\)).
- However, the program would not correctly count this pair because it does not properly check the condition for each pair.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
