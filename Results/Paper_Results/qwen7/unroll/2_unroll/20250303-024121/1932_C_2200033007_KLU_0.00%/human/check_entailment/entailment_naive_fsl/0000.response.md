Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the program does not compute the product of the array elements modulo `m` before printing the result. Instead, it directly appends the elements to the list `b` without performing the required modulo operation. This means that the output does not match the expected behavior described in the problem statement.

To fix this, the program should calculate the product of the remaining elements modulo `m` at each step and append the result to the list `ans`. Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    p = 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            p = (p * a[l]) % m
            l += 1
        else:
            p = (p * a[r]) % m
            r -= 1
        b.append(p)
    return b
```

With this correction, the program will correctly compute and output the remainders of the products as specified in the problem description.
