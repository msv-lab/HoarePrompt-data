Output State: **The program returns a list containing the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is a list containing the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order. The code `return reversed(ans)` returns a reverse iterator of the list `ans`. However, since the problem asks for the output state in a natural language format and not the exact type of iterator, we can describe it as a list containing the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order.
