Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `u` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2×10^5, and `tree` is a deque object.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty deque object named `tree`. The values of `t`, `u`, `v`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states, except that `t` is now considered to be the value inputted by the user, as per the initial state description.
