Postcondition: **`empty` is False, `t` remains the same, `u` and `v` are equal to `min(t, idx)` and `min(t, n - idx - 1)` respectively, `n` remains the same, `tree` is a deque containing integers after processing all inputs with the integer `start` added to the end, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`. There exists at least one move in `moves` such that the move is odd.**
