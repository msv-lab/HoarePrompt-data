Postcondition: `empty` is False, `t` remains the same, `u` and `v` are equal to `min(t, idx)` and `min(t, n - idx - 1)` respectively, `n` remains the same, `tree` is a deque containing integers after processing all inputs with the integer `start` added to the end, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`. If there is at least one odd move in `moves`, then the conditions related to `u` and `v` remain unchanged. If all moves in `moves` are even, then the conditions related to `u` and `v` also remain unchanged.
