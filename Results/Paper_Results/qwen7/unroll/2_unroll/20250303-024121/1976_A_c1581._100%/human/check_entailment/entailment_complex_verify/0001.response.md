### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It separates the characters into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - It sorts both lists.
   - It checks if any digit is greater than the next digit, which ensures digits are in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if any letter is greater than the last digit, ensuring no digit comes after a letter.
   - It concatenates the sorted digits and letters and compares the result with the original password to ensure the password meets the criteria.

Let's break down the logic step-by-step using the annotated code:

- **Initial State**: `password` is a string of length between 1 and 20, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
- **Separation and Sorting**:
  - The digits and letters are separated into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
  - Both lists are sorted.
- **Checking Conditions**:
  - The program checks if any digit is greater than the next digit (`for i in range(len(digits))`).
  - The program checks if any letter is greater than the last digit (`if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]`).

The key point here is the second check (`if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]`). This check is intended to ensure that no digit comes after a letter. However, this check is flawed because it only considers the last digit in the `digits` list. It should consider the last digit in the context of the entire list of digits, not just the last one.

For example, consider the password `123abc`. After sorting, `digits = ['1', '2', '3']` and `letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']`. The last digit is '3'. The check `digits[-1] > letters[i]` will fail for `i = 0` because `'3' > 'a'` is true, even though the password is still valid as per the problem statement.

To fix this, the check should be modified to ensure that no digit comes after a letter in the entire sequence, not just the last digit. A better approach would be to iterate through the sorted `digits` and `letters` together and ensure that the order is maintained.

Here is a revised version of the function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    
    i, j = 0, 0
    while i < len(digits) and j < len(letters):
        if digits[i] > letters[j]:
            return False
        i += 1
        j += 1
    
    # Check remaining digits
    while i < len(digits):
        if digits[i] > digits[i - 1]:
            return False
        i += 1
    
    # Check remaining letters
    while j < len(letters):
        if letters[j] > letters[j - 1]:
            return False
        j += 1
    
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    return sortedPassword == password
```

With this revised function, the program correctly validates the password according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was inaccurate due to the flawed check in `func_1`. The provided program is incorrect as it does not properly validate the condition that no digit comes after a letter.

### Final:
**False**
