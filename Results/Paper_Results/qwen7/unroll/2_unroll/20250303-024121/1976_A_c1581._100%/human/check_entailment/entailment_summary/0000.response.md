Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` correctly separates the digits and letters from the password.
2. It sorts the digits and letters separately.
3. It then checks if the last digit is greater than any of the letters, which ensures that no digit comes after a letter.
4. Finally, it concatenates the sorted digits and letters and compares this with the original password to ensure the order constraints are met.

Given the logic in the function, it appears to correctly implement the conditions specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the function should accurately determine whether a password is strong according to the given criteria.

Correctness: **True**
