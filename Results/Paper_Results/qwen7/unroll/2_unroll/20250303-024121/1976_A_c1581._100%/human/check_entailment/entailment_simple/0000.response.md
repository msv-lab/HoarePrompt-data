Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Implementation**:
   - The function correctly separates the digits and letters from the password.
   - It sorts the digits and letters separately.
   - It checks if any digit is greater than the next digit, which ensures the digits are in non-decreasing order.
   - It also checks if any digit is greater than any letter, ensuring that no digit comes after a letter.
   - After sorting, it constructs a new password from the sorted digits and letters and compares it with the original password. If they match, the password is considered strong.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the password consists only of digits or only of letters.
   - It correctly identifies invalid cases such as digits not being in non-decreasing order or digits coming after letters.

3. **Program Flow**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the password.
   - Based on the return value of `func_1`, it prints "YES" or "NO".

Given the above analysis, the provided implementation correctly follows the problem statement and handles all the specified conditions.

Correctness: **True**
