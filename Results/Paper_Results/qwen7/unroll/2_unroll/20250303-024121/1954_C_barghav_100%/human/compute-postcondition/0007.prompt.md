Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `f` is 1, `x` is a string representing an integer, `y` is a string representing an integer, `a` is a list of characters where each character has been swapped with another character based on the conditions in the loop, `b` is a list of characters from the input() function.

To explain further, the loop compares each character in list `a` with the corresponding character in list `b`. If the character in `a` is less than the character in `b`, they swap places and `f` is set to 1. If the character in `a` is greater than the character in `b`, `f` is set to 1. The loop continues until all characters in `a` have been compared with those in `b`. Since `f` is initially 0 and is only set to 1 under certain conditions, it will be 1 after the loop completes unless no swaps occurred. The lists `a` and `b` will contain characters that may have swapped positions according to the loop's conditions.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    print(a[i], end='')


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
