Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to generate a different string `r` for certain inputs. Specifically, when the input string `s` consists of unique characters, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" instead of generating a different permutation of the string. For example, for the input "co", the program should output "YES" followed by "oc", but it outputs "NO". This violates the requirement to output a different string `r` if possible.
