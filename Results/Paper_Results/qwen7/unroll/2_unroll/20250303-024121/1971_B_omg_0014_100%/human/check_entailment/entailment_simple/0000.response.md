### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Character Set Check**: For each string `s`, the program checks if the set of characters `a` has more than one unique character. This is done using `len(a) == 1`. If the set size is 1, it means all characters in `s` are the same, and thus, it's impossible to rearrange `s` into a different string `r`. In this case, the program prints "NO".
3. **Rearrangement Check**: If the set size is greater than 1, the program proceeds to check if sorting the string `s` in ascending order (`b`) results in a string equal to `s`. If so, it prints the reverse sorted string (`c`). Otherwise, it prints the sorted string (`b`).
4. **Output Format**: The program outputs "YES" followed by the rearranged string `r` if possible, or "NO" if not. The format matches the problem statement.

Given these points, the program logic appears to be correct and follows the problem requirements accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
