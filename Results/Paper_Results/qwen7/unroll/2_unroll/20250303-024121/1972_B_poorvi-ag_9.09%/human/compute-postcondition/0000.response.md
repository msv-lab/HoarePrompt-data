Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, and the code does not change the value of `t` or introduce any new variables, the only change is that `t` now holds the value input by the user, which is guaranteed to be within the specified range. The other variables (`n` and `s`) remain undefined and their initial conditions are preserved.
