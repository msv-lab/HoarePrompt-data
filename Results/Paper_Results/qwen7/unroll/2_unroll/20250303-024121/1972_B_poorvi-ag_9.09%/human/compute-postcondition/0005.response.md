Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The only object in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the list `results`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop body is omitted, but we know that for each iteration, `i` takes on a value from the list `results`. The values in `results` are determined by the conditions specified in the loop body.

3. **Determine the initial state of `results`**: The problem states that `results` is a list containing 'no' or 'yes' based on specific conditions. However, since the loop itself does not specify these conditions, we need to consider the initial state of `results` that would allow the loop to execute.

4. **Conditions for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element. If `results` were empty, the loop would not execute because there would be no elements to iterate over.

5. **Adjust the state**: Since `results` must contain at least one element, we need to ensure that `results` is not empty.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `results` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `results` is a list containing at least one 'no' or 'yes'**
