#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and s is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive); `results` is a list containing 'no' or 'yes' based on the conditions specified in the loop for each iteration. Specifically, if `n` (an integer input) is even, 'no' is appended; otherwise, if the count of 'U' in the string `arr` is greater than the count of 'D', 'yes' is appended; otherwise, 'no' is appended.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: Output State: The `results` list remains unchanged as the loop does not modify it. It contains 'no' or 'yes' based on the conditions specified in the loop for each iteration. The loop only iterates over the `results` list and prints its contents without altering them.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, it checks if `n` is even or if the count of "U" in the string `s` is greater than the count of "D". If `n` is even, it appends "no" to the results list; otherwise, it appends "yes" if the count of "U" is greater than the count of "D", and "no" otherwise. Finally, it prints the contents of the results list.
