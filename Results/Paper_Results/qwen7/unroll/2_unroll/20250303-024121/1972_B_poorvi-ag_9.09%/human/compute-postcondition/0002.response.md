State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.
2. The loop condition `range(t)` requires that `t` must be a positive integer, and specifically, it should be within the range of 1 to 100 inclusive.
3. Before the loop starts, `i` is initialized to 0 according to the `range(t)` syntax.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `t` must be an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
- `results` remains an empty list as it is not modified in the loop head.
- `i` is set to 0 at the beginning of the loop.
