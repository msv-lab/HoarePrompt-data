Reasoning:
1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1()` is supposed to find the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string for a given test case.
2. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the input values `n` and the two binary strings `a[0]` and `a[1]`.
3. **Finding the Lexicographically Smallest String**: The function attempts to find the longest common prefix between the first `x+1` characters of `a[0]` and the entire string `a[1]`. However, this approach does not correctly address the problem requirements. Specifically, it fails to consider all possible paths and the lexicographical order of the strings formed by these paths.
4. **Counting Paths**: The function sets `t` to 1 regardless of the actual number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string. This is incorrect because the number of paths should be calculated based on the structure of the grid and the positions of the 1s and 0s in the strings.

Given the above points, the function does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
