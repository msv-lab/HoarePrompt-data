Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is an empty list; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. Since the input is not specified, `n` is an input integer. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
