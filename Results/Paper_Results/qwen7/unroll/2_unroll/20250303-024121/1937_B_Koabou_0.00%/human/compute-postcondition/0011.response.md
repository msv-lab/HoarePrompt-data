Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `x`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is not explicitly initialized in the loop head, but it will start from 0 in each iteration.
   - `x` is a variable that is given as part of the program state.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `x`. Therefore, the loop will run until `i` reaches `x`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the loop will run until `i` is less than `x`. This means `i` should start from 0 and `x` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
   - The other variables (`t`, `a`, `n`, `s`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and their values do not affect the loop execution.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` starting from 0 and `x` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is 1, `a` is a list containing two elements which are the inputs provided during the loop executions, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string resulting from the loop's conditions, `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
