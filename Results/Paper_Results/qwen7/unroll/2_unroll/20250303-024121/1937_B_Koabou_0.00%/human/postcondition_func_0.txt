The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t`, an integer `n`, and two binary strings `a_{1}` and `a_{2}`. For each test case, it finds the longest common prefix between the first `x+1` characters of `a_{1}` and the entire string `a_{2}`, where `x` is the position just before the first mismatch. If no such prefix exists, `t` remains 1. The function then prints the found prefix and the value of `t`, which is always 1.
