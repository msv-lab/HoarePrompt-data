Output State: After executing the loop, the output state will consist of a series of strings printed to the console. Each string is formed by converting the third element of each inner list in `info` (after reducing `lex` by multiples of 26 or 1) into characters using the formula `chr(info[i][j] + 96)`, where `i` ranges from `0` to `cases-1` and `j` ranges from `0` to `2`. These characters are then concatenated to form a string for each iteration of the outer loop.
