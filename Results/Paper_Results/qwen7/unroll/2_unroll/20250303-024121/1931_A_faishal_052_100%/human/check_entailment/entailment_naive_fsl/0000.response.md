Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to generate the lexicographically smallest word for certain encoded values. For example, consider the encoded value `55`. According to the problem description, the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded is `"czz"`, but the program outputs `"azz"` instead. This happens because the program logic does not correctly handle the distribution of the remaining value after assigning the maximum possible value to the last character. Here's a breakdown of why it fails:

- For `n = 55`:
  - The program assigns `26` to the second character, leaving `29` for the third character.
  - It then incorrectly assigns `1` to the first character, resulting in `"azz"`.
  - The correct assignment should be `"czz"`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the first character is assigned the smallest possible value while still allowing the remaining value to be distributed correctly among the other two characters.
