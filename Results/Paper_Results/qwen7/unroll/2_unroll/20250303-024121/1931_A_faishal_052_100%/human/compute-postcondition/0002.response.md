Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `cases`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `cases` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\).
   - `info` is an empty list.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `cases`. Therefore, the loop will start executing if `i` is 0 and `cases` is at least 1.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0, we need to ensure that `i` is 0.
   - We need to ensure that `cases` is at least 1 because the loop will not execute if `cases` is 0.

5. **Formulate the final state**:
   - `cases` must be at least 1.
   - `i` must be 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 0**
