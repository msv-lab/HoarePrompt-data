Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Logic Error in Calculation**: The program attempts to reduce `lex` by multiples of 26 or 1, but it does not correctly handle the reduction process. Specifically, the logic for reducing `lex` by 26 or 1 is flawed and does not ensure that the resulting values correspond to valid letters in the alphabet.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Lexicographical Order**: The program sorts the array `arr` before forming the final word, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. The goal is to find the lexicographically smallest word, not to sort the intermediate values.

3. **Incorrect Final Word Construction**: The program constructs the final word by directly appending characters based on the values in `info[i]`, but these values do not necessarily represent the correct letters. The sorting step is not needed, and the values should be directly mapped to letters without sorting.

Given these issues, the program does not produce the correct lexicographically smallest words for the given test cases.

Correctness: **False**
