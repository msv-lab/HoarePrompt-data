Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `cases` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex`, which represents the encoded value of the word.

2. **Decoding the Encoded Value:**
   - The program attempts to decode the encoded value into a list of integers representing the positions of the letters in the alphabet.
   - It uses a series of conditional checks to assign values to the list `arr`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - If `lex` is less than 28, it assigns 1 to the first element of `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
   - If `lex` is between 28 and 52, it assigns 26 to the first element of `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - If `lex` is between 52 and 78, it again assigns 26 to the first element of `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - Finally, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.

4. **Sorting and Converting to Characters:**
   - The list `arr` is sorted.
   - Each element in `arr` is converted to the corresponding character using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)` and concatenated to form the final word.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Encoded Values:**
   - The logic for assigning values to `arr` is flawed. Specifically, the conditions do not correctly handle the range of possible encoded values.
   - For example, if `lex` is between 28 and 52, it should assign 26 to the second element of `arr` and subtract 26 from `lex`, but the current logic incorrectly assigns 26 to the first element.

2. **Sorting Before Conversion:**
   - Sorting `arr` before converting it to characters can lead to incorrect results. The original order of the elements is important for determining the lexicographically smallest word.

3. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program does not handle the edge case where `lex` is exactly 28, 52, or 78 correctly.

### Corrected Approach:

To correctly decode the encoded value and find the lexicographically smallest word, we need to:
1. Determine the possible values for the first two letters.
2. Assign the remaining value to the third letter.
3. Ensure the resulting word is lexicographically smallest.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Determine the possible values for the first two letters
        if lex >= 78:
            first = 26
            second = 26
            third = lex - 52
        elif lex >= 52:
            first = 26
            second = lex - 26
            third = 1
        else:
            first = lex // 26
            second = lex % 26
            third = 1
        
        # Convert the values to characters
        first_char = chr(first + 96)
        second_char = chr(second + 96)
        third_char = chr(third + 96)
        
        print(first_char + second_char + third_char)

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect due to the flawed logic for handling the encoded values and the incorrect sorting approach. The corrected program above should provide the correct lexicographically smallest word for each test case.

**Correctness: **False**
