Output State: **`cases` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ cases ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.**

Explanation: The code `cases = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `cases`. The initial conditions for `t` and the range for `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
