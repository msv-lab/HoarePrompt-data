Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that could have been encoded to a given integer. The encoding is the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet.
2. **Analysis of the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it calculates the possible values for the letters in the word based on the given encoded integer (`lex`).
   - The logic to determine the values of the letters seems to be flawed. Specifically, the conditions for appending values to the list `arr` do not accurately reflect the encoding process.
   - After sorting the list, it converts the sorted values back to characters and prints them.
3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should start with the smallest possible values for the letters and adjust based on the encoded integer.
   - We need to ensure that the sum of the positions of the letters equals the given encoded integer.
4. **Verification**:
   - The provided execution summary does not match the expected behavior of the problem. The code does not correctly handle the encoding and decoding process.
   - The example outputs suggest that the code is working correctly for some test cases, but the logic is not robust enough to handle all cases.

Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
