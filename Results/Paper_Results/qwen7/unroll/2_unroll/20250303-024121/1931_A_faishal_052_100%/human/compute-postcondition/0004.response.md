Output State: `info` is a list of lists where each inner list contains four elements. The first two elements are either 1 or 26 depending on the value of `lex` after processing, and the last element is the remaining value of `lex` after it has been reduced by multiples of 26 or 1. Each inner list is sorted. The exact contents of `info` depend on the input values provided during each iteration of the loop.
