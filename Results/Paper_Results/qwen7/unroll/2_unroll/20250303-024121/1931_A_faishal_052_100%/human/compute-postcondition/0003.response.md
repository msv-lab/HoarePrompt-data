Output State: `info` is a list of lists where each inner list contains four elements. The first two elements are either 1 or 26 depending on the value of `lex` after the first two iterations, and the last element is the remaining value of `lex`. After sorting each inner list, the elements are in ascending order. Each inner list corresponds to one iteration of the outer loop based on the value of `cases`.
