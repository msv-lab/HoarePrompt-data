Reasoning:
The provided program aims to calculate the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure that there are at least `m` problems of each difficulty level ('A' to 'F') among the existing problems and the newly created ones. The program uses the following steps:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`.
3. It then reads the string `s` representing the difficulties of the existing problems.
4. It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total number of additional problems needed.
5. It defines a string `p` containing the difficulty levels 'A' to 'F'.
6. It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.
7. It iterates over the difficulty levels 'A' to 'F':
   - If a difficulty level is missing (`not in hmp`), it adds `m` to `ans` (since Vlad needs to create `m` problems of that difficulty).
   - If the count of a difficulty level in `hmp` is less than `m`, it adds the difference (`m - hmp[i]`) to `ans`.
8. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

Given this logic, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed to meet the requirement for each test case. The provided example in the execution summary also matches the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
