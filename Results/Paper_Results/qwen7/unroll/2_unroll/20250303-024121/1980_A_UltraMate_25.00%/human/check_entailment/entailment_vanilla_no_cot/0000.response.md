Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the way it calculates the additional problems needed for each difficulty level.

- The program correctly identifies that if a difficulty level is missing, Vlad needs to create `m` problems of that difficulty.
- However, the second loop incorrectly increments `ans` by `m - hmp[i]` for each difficulty level that has fewer problems than `m`. This logic is flawed because it doesn't account for the fact that once a certain difficulty level meets the requirement, no further problems are needed for that level in subsequent rounds.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        ans = 0
        required_counts = [0] * 7  # To keep track of required counts for each difficulty level
        hmp = Counter(s)
        
        # Calculate the required counts for each difficulty level
        for i in range(1, 7):  # Difficulty levels A to F
            required_counts[i] = m - hmp.get(chr(65 + i), 0)
        
        # Sum up the required counts
        for count in required_counts:
            if count > 0:
                ans += count
        
        print(ans)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected program:
1. Initializes an array `required_counts` to keep track of how many more problems are needed for each difficulty level.
2. Uses `hmp.get(chr(65 + i), 0)` to get the count of problems for each difficulty level.
3. Calculates the difference between the required number of problems (`m`) and the current count of problems for each difficulty level.
4. Sums up the positive values in `required_counts` to get the total number of additional problems needed.
