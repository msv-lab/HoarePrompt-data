Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads `n` and `k` using `func_3()` which is equivalent to reading the input and splitting it into integers.
   - This part is correct.

2. **Finding Maximum Value `v`:**
   - The program iterates from `n` down to `1` and prints a query `? 1 {i * n}` to find the smallest `r` such that `f(1, r) = i * n`.
   - If `v` is found to be `n`, it breaks the loop and sets `v = i`.
   - This logic seems to be aimed at finding the maximum possible value `v` that can be achieved by `f(l, r)` for some `l` and `r`.

3. **Splitting the Array:**
   - The program then attempts to split the array into `k` subarrays where each subarray's `f(l, r)` equals `v`.
   - It iterates from `1` to `n // k` and tries to find the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = i * v` for each segment.
   - If it finds a valid segment, it prints the result and exits.
   - If no valid segments are found, it prints `-1`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Query Handling:**
   - The program assumes that `v` is the maximum value achievable by `f(l, r)` but does not verify this assumption.
   - The logic to find `v` might not always work as intended, especially if the hidden array does not allow such values.

2. **Segment Splitting Logic:**
   - The logic to split the array into `k` subarrays is flawed. It does not ensure that the segments are valid according to the problem constraints.
   - The program assumes that if it finds a segment with `f(l, r) = i * v`, then the rest of the segments will also be valid, which is not necessarily true.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where no valid segments can be found, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program does not correctly solve the problem due to the issues mentioned above. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
