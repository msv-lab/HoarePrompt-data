Output State: v is the smallest integer greater than or equal to n/2, n is the return value of func_3(), k is the return value of func_3(), i is the last value of the loop iteration (n // k), cnt is 0, l is n + 1.

Explanation: The loop runs for `n // k` iterations. During each iteration, the loop prints a query and updates `cnt` and `l`. If `cnt` reaches 0 and `l` equals `n + 1`, it prints a final result and returns. Since the loop runs until completion, `i` will be the last value of the loop iteration, which is `n // k`. After the loop completes, `cnt` is set to 0 and `l` is set to `n + 1`.
