Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i`, `n`, and the step value `-1`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n, 0, -1)` will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 0. If `n` is less than 0, the loop will not execute.
   - The variable `i` starts from `n` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 0.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `n` is the return value of `func_3()`, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `i` will start from `n` and decrement, but its initial value before the loop starts is `n`.
   - The step value `-1` is fixed and does not need adjustment.

Given the initial state where `v` is 1, `n` is the return value of `func_3()`, and `k` is the return value of `func_3()`, we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the value of `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`v` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` is the return value of `func_3()`**
