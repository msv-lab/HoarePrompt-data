The function reads five integers from standard input, which must be formatted as a space-separated line. These integers represent \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^3), \( n \) (1 ≤ \( k \) ≤ \( n \) ≤ 10^4), \( k \), \( l \) (1 ≤ \( l \) ≤ \( n \)), and \( x \) (1 ≤ \( x \) ≤ 10^9). It then returns these values as a tuple (t, n, k, l, x).
