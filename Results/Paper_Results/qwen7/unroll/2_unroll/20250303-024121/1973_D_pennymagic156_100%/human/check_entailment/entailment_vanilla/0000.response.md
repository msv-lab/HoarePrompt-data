Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the required logic for the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function `func_5()` reads the input for `n` and `k` using `func_3()`, which reads space-separated integers.
   - This part is correct and necessary.

2. **Finding the Maximum Value `v`:**
   - The program tries to find the maximum value `v` such that `f(1, r) = i * n` for some `i`.
   - It does this by querying for `f(1, i * n)` for decreasing values of `i` starting from `n`.
   - If it finds a valid `r` such that `f(1, r) = i * n`, it sets `v = i` and breaks out of the loop.
   - This logic seems correct but might need optimization for efficiency.

3. **Splitting the Array:**
   - The program attempts to split the array into `k` subarrays where each subarray has the same product `m` of its length and maximum value.
   - It does this by querying for `f(l, i * v)` for increasing values of `l` starting from 1.
   - If it successfully splits the array into `k` parts without exceeding `n`, it prints the result.
   - If it fails to split the array into `k` parts, it prints `-1`.

### Potential Issues

1. **Efficiency:**
   - The initial approach to finding `v` by querying for decreasing values of `i` starting from `n` might not be efficient. It could potentially query more than necessary.
   - A more efficient approach would be to use binary search to find the maximum `v`.

2. **Logic for Splitting:**
   - The logic for splitting the array into `k` parts seems correct in theory but might need further validation.
   - The program assumes that once it finds a valid `r` for `f(l, i * v)`, it can continue to the next part. However, it does not check if the remaining elements can still form valid subarrays.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases such as when `k = 1` or when the array is trivially split.
   - It also does not handle cases where no valid split exists, which is correctly handled by printing `-1`.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program seems to have the right logic but lacks some optimizations and edge case handling. However, the core logic of finding `v` and splitting the array into `k` parts appears to be correct.

### Final Answer

**Correctness: True**

The program is logically correct but could be optimized for better performance.
