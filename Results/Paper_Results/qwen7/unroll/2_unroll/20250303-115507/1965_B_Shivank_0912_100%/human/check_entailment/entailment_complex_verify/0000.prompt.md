You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        i = 0
        while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
            i = i + 1
        ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
        for j in range(20):
            if j != i:
                ans.append(1 << j)
        print(len(ans))
        print(*ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        i = 0
        
        while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
            i = i + 1
        
        ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
        
        for j in range(20):
            if j != i:
                ans.append(1 << j)
        
        print(len(ans))
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: Output State: t test cases are processed. For each test case, the output consists of the length of the list `ans` followed by the elements of `ans`. The list `ans` contains specific integers derived from the values of `n` and `k` for each test case. Specifically, `ans` includes `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and all powers of 2 up to 2^19 (since the loop runs for 20 iterations but skips the index `i`). The values printed for each test case depend on the inputs `n` and `k`, but the structure of the output remains consistent across all test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \). It then calculates a list of integers based on these values and prints the length of this list followed by its elements. The list includes specific values derived from \( k \) and all powers of 2 up to \( 2^{19} \), excluding one particular power of 2. After processing all test cases, it outputs the results for each case, ensuring the output structure is consistent.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not generate a sequence that satisfies the conditions for all test cases. Specifically, consider the test case where `n = 10` and `k = 7`. According to the problem description, the sequence should not have any subsequence with a sum of `k`, but for all other values `v` from `1` to `n` where `v ≠ k`, there should be a subsequence with a sum of `v`.

However, the generated sequence `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` along with additional powers of 2 up to `20` does not guarantee that there will be no subsequence with a sum of `k`. In this specific case, the sequence might still include a subsequence that sums to `7`, which violates the condition.

For instance, if `i = 2` (since `1 << 2 + 1 > 7`), the sequence would be `[7 - 4, 8, 8 + 4]`, which simplifies to `[3, 8, 12]`. This sequence includes the subsequence `[3, 8]` which sums to `11`, but more importantly, it does not ensure that no subsequence sums to `7`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and is thus incorrect.
