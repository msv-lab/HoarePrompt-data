Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), and for each t, two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n) are processed. The function returns a result based on the conditions given for n and k, without explicitly showing how it operates internally.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing values for t, n, and k. It processes these values according to the specified constraints and returns a result for each test case, but the exact nature of the return value (whether it's a specific calculation, condition check, or other type of output) is not detailed here.
