Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze whether it meets the requirements specified in the problem statement.

1. **Test Cases Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases as indicated by the loop `for tc in range(t)` which iterates over each test case.
2. **Sequence Length**: The program ensures that the sequence length \( m \) is at most 25, as required.
3. **No Subsequence Summing to \( k \)**: The sequence is constructed to ensure that no subsequence sums to \( k \). This is achieved by including \( k - (1 << i) \) and \( k + 1 + (1 << i) \) in the sequence, where \( i \) is calculated such that \( 1 << i + 1 > k \). This effectively skips the value \( k \) in the sequence.
4. **Subsequences Summing to All Values from 1 to \( n \) except \( k \)**: The sequence includes all powers of 2 up to \( 2^{19} \), ensuring that every integer from 1 to \( n \) (except \( k \)) can be represented as a sum of some subset of these powers of 2. This is a valid approach because the set of powers of 2 can generate all positive integers through their combinations.
5. **Output Structure**: The program outputs the length of the sequence followed by the elements of the sequence, which matches the required format.

Given the above points, the program appears to meet all the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
