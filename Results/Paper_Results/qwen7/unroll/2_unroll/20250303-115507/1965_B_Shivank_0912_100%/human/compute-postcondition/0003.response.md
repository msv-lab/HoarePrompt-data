Output State: t test cases are processed. For each test case, the output consists of the length of the list `ans` followed by the elements of `ans`. The list `ans` contains specific integers derived from the values of `n` and `k` for each test case. Specifically, `ans` includes `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and all powers of 2 up to 2^19 (since the loop runs for 20 iterations but skips the index `i`). The values printed for each test case depend on the inputs `n` and `k`, but the structure of the output remains consistent across all test cases.
