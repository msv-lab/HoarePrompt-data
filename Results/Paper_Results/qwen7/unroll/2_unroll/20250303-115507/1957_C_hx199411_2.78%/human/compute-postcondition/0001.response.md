State right before the while loop, the variable `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.
```
while t:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop condition is `t`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be non-zero (i.e., `t` must be true in a boolean context).
3. Given that `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and the input is guaranteed to be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `t` will always be a non-zero integer.

Since `t` is guaranteed to be a non-zero integer based on the problem constraints, no adjustments are necessary to ensure the loop can execute the first time.

State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive**
