Output State: T is an integer indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, the variables are as follows: 
- n and k are integers read from standard input.
- a is a list of integers read from standard input.
- s is the sum of elements in list a.
- t and tmp are integers initialized to 0.
- ans is an integer calculated based on the values of s, t, and k through the loop operations.
- MOD is 1000000007, which remains unchanged.
After processing all test cases, ans is printed for each test case, representing the final value of ans for that specific test case.
