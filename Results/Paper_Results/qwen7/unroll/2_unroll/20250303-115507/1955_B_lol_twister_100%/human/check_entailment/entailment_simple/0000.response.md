Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to check if the given list of integers `l` can form a progressive square with the given parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `c`, `d`, and the list `l`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It finds the minimum value `a` in the list `l`.
   - It generates the expected progressive square values and stores them in the list `li`.
   - It sorts both `li` and `l` to compare them.
   - If `l` and `li` are equal, it returns `'yes'`, indicating that the list `l` can form a progressive square.
   - Otherwise, it returns `'no'`, indicating that the list `l` cannot form a progressive square.

The logic implemented in `func_1` is correct and follows the problem statement accurately. The program correctly identifies whether the given list of integers can form a progressive square based on the provided parameters.

Correctness: **True**
