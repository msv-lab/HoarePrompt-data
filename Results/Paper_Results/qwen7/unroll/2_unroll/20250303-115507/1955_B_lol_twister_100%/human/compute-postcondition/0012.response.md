The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l`. `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, and `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^9. The function returns either the string 'yes' or 'no'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n`, two integers `c` and `d`, and a list `l` of n^2 integers, and based on some unspecified conditions, it returns 'yes' or 'no'.
