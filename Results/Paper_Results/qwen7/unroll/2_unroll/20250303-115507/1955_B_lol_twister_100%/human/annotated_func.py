#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, c and d are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, and l is a list of n^2 integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^9.
def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):
        for h in range(0, n):
            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6; `li` is a list containing 500*500 = 250000 elements, each element being `a + k*c + d*h` where `k` and `h` range from 0 to 499.
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if (l == li) :
        return 'yes'
        #The program returns the string 'yes'
    #State: `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6; `li` is a list containing 250000 elements sorted in ascending order, each element being `a + k*c + d*h` where `k` and `h` range from 0 to 499; `l` is sorted in ascending order. The lists `l` and `li` are not equal
    return 'no'
    #The program returns 'no'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: an integer `n` (with 2 ≤ n ≤ 500), two integers `c` and `d` (with 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6), and a list `l` of n^2 integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^9). It calculates a new list `li` based on the minimum value in `l` and the parameters `c` and `d`. Both `li` and `l` are then sorted. If the sorted lists `l` and `li` are identical, the function returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'.
