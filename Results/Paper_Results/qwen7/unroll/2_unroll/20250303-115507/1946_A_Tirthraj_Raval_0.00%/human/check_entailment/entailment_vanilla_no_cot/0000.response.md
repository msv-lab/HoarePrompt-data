Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The current implementation simply counts how many times the median value appears in the array, which is not relevant to the problem's requirement of increasing the median through the minimum number of operations.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to compare each element in the array with the median and count how many operations are needed to make the median strictly greater than its current value. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    """Median of Array"""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        median = a[p]
        operations = 0
        
        # Count how many elements are equal to the median
        count_median = a.count(median)
        
        # Calculate the number of operations needed
        for i in range(p + 1, n):
            if a[i] <= median:
                operations += 1
            else:
                break
        
        for i in range(p):
            if a[i] >= median:
                operations += 1
            else:
                break
        
        print(operations)

func()
```

This solution correctly calculates the minimum number of operations needed to ensure the median increases.
