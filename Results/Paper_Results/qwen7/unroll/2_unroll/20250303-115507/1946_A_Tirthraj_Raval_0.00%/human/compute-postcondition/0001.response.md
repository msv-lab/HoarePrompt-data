Output State: **`t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases, and no other variables have been defined or modified.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, the value of `t` remains a positive integer. No other variables (`n`, `a`) are defined or modified in this code snippet.
