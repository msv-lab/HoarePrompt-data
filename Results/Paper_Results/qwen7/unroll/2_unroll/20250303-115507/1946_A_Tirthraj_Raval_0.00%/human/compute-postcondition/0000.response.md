Output State: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer representing the length of the array a, and a is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9]. No changes have been made to the variables.**

The provided code is empty (`""""Median of Array"""`). Therefore, no operations are performed on the variables, and their initial states remain unchanged.
