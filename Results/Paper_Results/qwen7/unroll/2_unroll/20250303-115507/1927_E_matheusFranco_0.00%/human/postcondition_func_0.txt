The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from user input, where `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5` and `k` is even. It then constructs a list `permutation` of length `n` where certain indices are assigned specific values based on the rules defined within the loop. Finally, it prints a string of space-separated integers representing the `permutation` list.
