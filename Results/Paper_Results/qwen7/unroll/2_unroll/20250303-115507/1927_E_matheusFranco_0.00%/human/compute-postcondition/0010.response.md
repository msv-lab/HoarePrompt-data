Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.**

Given the constraints, the function does not take any parameters but operates within specific conditions (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and k is even). However, since the function definition provided does not include any parameters and only describes the constraints, it implies that the function itself does not utilize any external inputs. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept no parameters and return nothing.
