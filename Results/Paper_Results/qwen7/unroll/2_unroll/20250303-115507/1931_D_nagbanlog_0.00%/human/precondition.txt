t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers n, x, and y representing the size of the array and Polycarp's favorite integers, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n representing the elements of the array. Additionally, n is between 2 and 2 * 10^5, x and y are between 1 and 10^9, and each a_i is between 1 and 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
