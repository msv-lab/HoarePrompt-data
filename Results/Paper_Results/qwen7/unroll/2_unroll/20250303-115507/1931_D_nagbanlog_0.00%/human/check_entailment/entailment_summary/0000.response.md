Reasoning:
1. The provided program `func_1` correctly processes each test case according to the problem description.
2. It initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of each pair of remainders when dividing by `x` and `y`.
3. For each element in the array, it calculates the required remainders to form a "beautiful pair" and checks if these remainders have been seen before in the array.
4. If a matching pair of remainders is found, it increments the count of beautiful pairs.
5. The logic for calculating the required remainders and checking them against the frequency dictionary is correct.
6. The overall structure and flow of the program match the requirements of the problem.

Given this analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
