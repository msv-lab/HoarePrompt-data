You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find the number of beautiful pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) in the array \(a\) where \(1 \le i < j \le n\).
   - A pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if:
     - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
     - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

2. **Given Program Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two arguments: `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of dictionaries containing the parameters and arrays for each test case).
   - For each test case, it initializes variables such as `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a`.
   - It uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of each pair of remainders when elements of the array are divided by \(x\) and \(y\).
   - For each element in the array, it calculates the required remainders and checks if these remainders have been seen before.
   - If the required remainder pair exists in `freq`, it adds the corresponding count to `beautiful_count`.

3. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The logic for calculating the required remainders and checking their existence in `freq` is correct.
   - However, there is a logical error in the calculation of `required_mod_x`. Specifically, the line `required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x` should be `required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x` but this is already correctly implemented.
   - The main issue is with the logic for determining the beautiful pairs. The current implementation seems to assume that if a pair of remainders is found, it means a beautiful pair exists, which is not necessarily true without further validation.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - Let's verify the example provided in the problem statement using the given program.
   - For the first test case: \(n = 6\), \(x = 5\), \(y = 2\), and \(a = [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6]\).
     - The beautiful pairs are \(\langle 1, 5 \rangle\) and \(\langle 4, 6 \rangle\).
     - The program should correctly identify these pairs.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Upon closer inspection, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find beautiful pairs. The current approach does not ensure that both conditions \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\) are met simultaneously for each pair.
