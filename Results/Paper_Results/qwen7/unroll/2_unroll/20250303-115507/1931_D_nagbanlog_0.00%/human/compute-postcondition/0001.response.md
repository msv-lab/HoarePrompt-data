State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, each tuple must contain four elements (n, x, y, and a list of n integers)**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop iterates over `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples.
2. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple.
3. Each tuple in `test_cases` must have exactly four elements: `(n, x, y, and a list of n integers)`.
4. The other variables (`results` and `t`) do not directly affect whether the loop can execute, but they are part of the initial state.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple.
- Each tuple in `test_cases` must have four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `n` integers.
