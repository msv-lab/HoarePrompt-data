Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `zero_perc` and `one_perc`:**
   - The percentages `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are calculated as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))` and `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, respectively. This approach is incorrect because it calculates the percentage of zeros and ones relative to the total number of houses seen so far, rather than the number of houses on each side of the potential road.

2. **Incorrect Handling of the Condition:**
   - The condition `if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:` checks whether the percentage of zeros and ones is at least 50%, but it should check the count of zeros and ones on each side against the required threshold (`ceil(len(left_side) / 2)` and `ceil(len(right_side) / 2)`).

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the number of zeros or ones is less than the required threshold on both sides.

4. **Final Output Logic:**
   - The logic to find the optimal position `i` is flawed. It should find the position that minimizes `abs(pk - ele)` while ensuring the counts of zeros and ones meet the criteria.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        pk = math.ceil(n / 2)
        sl = list(s)
        o = sl.count('1')
        z = sl.count('0')
        (zero, one) = (0, 0)
        lst = []
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero += 1
            else:
                one += 1
            if zero >= math.ceil((i + 1) / 2) and one >= math.ceil((n - i - 1) / 2):
                lst.append(i + 1)
        
        if not lst:
            if z >= pk:
                print(0)
            else:
                print(n)
        else:
            mini = min(abs(pk - ele) for ele in lst)
            final = [ele for ele in lst if abs(pk - ele) == mini]
            print(min(final))

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the counts of zeros and ones on each side meet the required thresholds and finds the optimal position `i` that minimizes the distance from the center of the village.
