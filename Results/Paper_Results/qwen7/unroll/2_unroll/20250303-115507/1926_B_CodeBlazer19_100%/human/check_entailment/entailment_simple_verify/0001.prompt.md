You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, and the grid is represented as a list of n strings, each string containing n characters that are either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = 0
        
        b = ''
        
        for j in range(n):
            s = input()

                a = 'TRIANGLE'
            elif s.count('1') > 1:
                b = 'SQUARE'
        
        if a != 0:
            print(a)
        else:
            print(b)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` integers are inputted. For each integer `n`, `n` strings are inputted. If any string has exactly one '1', the output is 'TRIANGLE'. Otherwise, the output is 'SQUARE'. The final output consists of either 'TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE' for each input pair (n, strings).



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` of the grid and the grid itself.

2. **Triangle Detection**:
   - The program checks each row of the grid to see if it contains exactly one '1'.
   - If any row contains exactly one '1', it sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'. This is a correct approach to detect a potential triangle.

3. **Square Detection**:
   - The program checks each row to see if it contains more than one '1'.
   - If any row contains more than one '1', it sets `b` to 'SQUARE'. This is a correct approach to detect a potential square.

4. **Output Determination**:
   - The program prints 'TRIANGLE' if `a` is set, indicating a triangle was detected.
   - If no row contained exactly one '1', it prints 'SQUARE'.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the grid might contain both a triangle and a square simultaneously, which is not possible according to the problem statement.
   - However, the problem guarantees that there will be exactly one triangle or one square, so this is not a concern here.

6. **Logic Flaw**:
   - The logic has a flaw in handling multiple test cases. The variable `b` is only updated if any row contains more than one '1'. If no such row is found, `b` remains empty, leading to incorrect results for some test cases.

### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**:
  - Grid:
    ```
    000
    011
    011
    ```
  - The program correctly identifies it as a triangle and prints "TRIANGLE".

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Grid:
    ```
    0000
    0000
    0100
    1110
    ```
  - The program correctly identifies it as a triangle and prints "TRIANGLE".

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Grid:
    ```
    11
    11
    ```
  - The program correctly identifies it as a square and prints "SQUARE".

- **Test Case 4**:
  - Grid:
    ```
    00111
    00010
    00000
    00000
    00000
    ```
  - The program correctly identifies it as a triangle and prints "TRIANGLE".

- **Test Case 5**:
  - Grid:
    ```
    0000000000
    0000000000
    0000000000
    0000000000
    0000000000
    1111111110
    0111111100
    0011111000
    0001110000
    0000100000
    ```
  - The program correctly identifies it as a triangle and prints "TRIANGLE".

- **Test Case 6**:
  - Grid:
    ```
    111
    111
    111
    ```
  - The program correctly identifies it as a square and prints "SQUARE".

### Conclusion:
Despite the logic flaw in handling multiple test cases, the program correctly identifies the shapes for each individual test case based on the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct for the given problem description.
