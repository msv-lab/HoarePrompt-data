Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly identify whether the shape is a triangle or a square. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Triangle Detection**: The program checks if any row contains exactly one '1'. If so, it assumes the shape is a triangle. However, this is not sufficient because a triangle can have multiple rows with more than one '1' but still be a valid triangle.
  
2. **Square Detection**: The program checks if any row contains more than one '1'. If so, it assumes the shape is a square. This is also not sufficient because a square can have multiple rows with more than one '1' but still be a valid square.

To correctly identify the shape, the program needs to check the structure of the grid more thoroughly. Specifically, it should verify the pattern of '1's to ensure they form either a triangle or a square.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_triangle(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    for i in range(1, n):
        if grid[i].count('1') != 2 * i + 1:
            return False
    return True

def is_square(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    for i in range(1, n):
        if grid[i].count('1') != n:
            return False
    return True

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        if is_triangle(grid):
            print("TRIANGLE")
        elif is_square(grid):
            print("SQUARE")
        else:
            print("UNKNOWN")

func()
```

This version checks the grid more accurately to determine if it forms a triangle or a square based on the given definitions.
