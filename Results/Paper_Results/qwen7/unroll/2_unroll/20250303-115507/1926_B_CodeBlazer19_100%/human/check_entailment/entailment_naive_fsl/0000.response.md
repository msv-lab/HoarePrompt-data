Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. Here's an analysis of why it fails:

1. The program checks each row to see if it contains exactly one '1'. If so, it assumes a triangle. However, this logic is flawed because:
   - A triangle can have multiple rows with more than one '1'.
   - A square can have rows with only one '1' if the '1's are aligned in a way that doesn't form a continuous block.

2. The program sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE' if any row has exactly one '1', and `b` to 'SQUARE' if any row has more than one '1'. This approach is incorrect because:
   - It does not check if the '1's form a continuous block, which is required for both shapes.
   - It does not handle the case where the grid contains a mix of rows with different numbers of '1's that form either a triangle or a square.

3. Consider the following grid:
   ```
   00000
   00000
   01110
   01110
   00000
   ```
   This grid contains a square but the program would incorrectly identify it as a triangle because the third and fourth rows each have three '1's.

4. Another example:
   ```
   00000
   00000
   01110
   01110
   01110
   ```
   This grid contains a triangle but the program would incorrectly identify it as a square because the third, fourth, and fifth rows each have three '1's.

Therefore, the program does not correctly identify the shape in all cases and thus is incorrect.
