You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads a grid represented as a list of strings. Each string contains binary characters ('0' or '1'). The function determines whether the grid contains a triangle or a square that includes all the '1's and prints 'TRIANGLE' if a triangle is found, otherwise it prints 'SQUARE'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. Here's an analysis of why it fails:

1. The program checks each row to see if it contains exactly one '1'. If so, it assumes a triangle. However, this logic is flawed because:
   - A triangle can have multiple rows with more than one '1'.
   - A square can have rows with only one '1' if the '1's are aligned in a way that doesn't form a continuous block.

2. The program sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE' if any row has exactly one '1', and `b` to 'SQUARE' if any row has more than one '1'. This approach is incorrect because:
   - It does not check if the '1's form a continuous block, which is required for both shapes.
   - It does not handle the case where the grid contains a mix of rows with different numbers of '1's that form either a triangle or a square.

3. Consider the following grid:
   ```
   00000
   00000
   01110
   01110
   00000
   ```
   This grid contains a square but the program would incorrectly identify it as a triangle because the third and fourth rows each have three '1's.

4. Another example:
   ```
   00000
   00000
   01110
   01110
   01110
   ```
   This grid contains a triangle but the program would incorrectly identify it as a square because the third, fourth, and fifth rows each have three '1's.

Therefore, the program does not correctly identify the shape in all cases and thus is incorrect.
