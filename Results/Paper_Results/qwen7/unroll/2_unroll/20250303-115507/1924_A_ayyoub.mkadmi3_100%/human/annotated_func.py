#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets, k and n are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, and m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000.
def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
        
    #State: Output State: `s1` is a string consisting of all characters from `s` that are in the set `alphabet`, `s2` is a string containing the single character from `alphabet` if `len(alphabet)` was originally 1, otherwise it is an empty string, `s2` is also a string containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets if `len(alphabet)` was originally 1, `s` is an unchanged string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets if `len(alphabet)` was originally 1, otherwise it is an empty set.
    r = len(s1) // k
    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #The program returns a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, followed by a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` and going to the end, and finally the string `s2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s`, a positive integer `k`, and another positive integer `n`. It filters `s` to create two new strings, `s1` and `s2`. `s1` contains all characters from `s` that are within the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, while `s2` contains either the last character from `s1` if `s1` originally contained exactly one character from the first `k` alphabets, or is empty otherwise. The function then checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, and returns this check result along with a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` (where `r` is the length of `s1` divided by `k`) to the end, and the string `s2`.
