You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `s`, `k`, and `n`.
   - It initializes an empty string `s1` and `s2`.
   - It creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s` and checks if it belongs to the `alphabet`.
     - If the character is in `alphabet`, it removes the character from `alphabet` if `alphabet` has more than one element.
     - Otherwise, it appends the character to `s2` and resets `alphabet` to its initial state.
     - It appends the character to `s1` in all cases.
   - After the loop, it calculates the quotient `r` of `len(s1)` divided by `k`.
   - It returns a tuple `(len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)`.

2. **Main Program Analysis:**
   - The main program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` followed by the string `s`.
   - It calls `func_1(s, k, n)` and stores the result.
   - If the first element of the returned tuple is `False`, it appends 'No' to `OUT` and constructs a string `be9i` of length `n - len(s2)` using the first available character in `alphabet` that is not in `s1`. It then appends this string to `s2` and adds the result to `OUT`.
   - If the first element is `True`, it appends 'Yes' to `OUT`.
   - Finally, it prints each element in `OUT`.

3. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies if the string `s` contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - The main program logic correctly handles both cases (YES and NO) and prints the appropriate output.
   - The construction of `be9i` ensures that a valid string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s` is generated when necessary.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the required functionality according to the problem statement.
