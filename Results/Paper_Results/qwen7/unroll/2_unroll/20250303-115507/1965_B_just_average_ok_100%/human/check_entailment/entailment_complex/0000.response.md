Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires constructing a sequence \(a\) of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
   - No subsequence sums to \(k\).
   - All integers from 1 to \(n\) (excluding \(k\)) can be represented as a subsequence sum.

2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The code correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - It initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\).
   - It identifies the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\) and adjusts the list accordingly.
   - It ensures that the constructed list meets the required conditions by including specific values related to \(k\) and removing one element based on the value of \(k\).

3. **Key Steps**:
   - **Initialization**: The list `nums` is initialized with powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\).
   - **Finding Largest Power of 2 Less Than or Equal to \(k\)**: This helps in ensuring that no subsequence sums to \(k\).
   - **Adjusting List**: The list is adjusted to include \(k\), \(k - 2^j\) (where \(2^j\) is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\)), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 2^j + 1\), and one element is removed based on the value of \(k\).
   - **Output**: The length of the list and the list itself are printed for each test case.

4. **Verification**:
   - The constructed list `nums` will have up to 24 unique elements.
   - The list construction ensures that no subsequence sums to \(k\).
   - The list construction also ensures that all integers from 1 to \(n\) (excluding \(k\)) can be represented as a subsequence sum.

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly constructs the sequence according to the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
