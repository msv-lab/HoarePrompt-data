Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine the number of possible initial arrays `a` of size `n` (consisting of only 1 and -1) such that the sorted prefix sums match the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function aims to compute the number of ways to construct the array `a` that results in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - It uses dynamic programming to count the number of valid sequences.
   - The state `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to reach the value `j - offset` in the prefix sum array before sorting.

3. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
   - For each position `i` in the prefix sum array, the function updates the DP table by considering the previous values.
   - If `dp[j]` is greater than 0, it means we can transition from `j` to `j+1` and `j-1` with a probability of `dp[j]`.

4. **Final Sum Calculation**:
   - The final sum `final_sum` is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`, where `offset` is `n`. This is the last value in the prefix sum array after sorting.

5. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input and processes each test case using `func_1`.
   - It reads the input from standard input, processes each test case, and prints the result.

### Detailed Reasoning

1. **Dynamic Programming Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly models the transitions between prefix sums.
   - However, the implementation assumes that the prefix sums can be constructed in a way that matches the given sorted prefix sums. This is a key assumption.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases like the size of the array and the constraints on the prefix sums.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required bounds.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program.
   - The dynamic programming approach is sound for counting the number of valid sequences.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code and the problem statement, the program appears to be correct. It correctly implements the dynamic programming solution to count the number of valid initial arrays `a` that result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
