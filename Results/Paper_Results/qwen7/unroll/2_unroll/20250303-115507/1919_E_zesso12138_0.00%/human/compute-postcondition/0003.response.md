Output State: **`index` is 1, `t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[index])`**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(data[index])` assigns the value of `int(data[index])` to `t`. Since `index` was initially 0, after executing this line, `index` is incremented to 1. The value of `t` is now the integer obtained from converting `data[1]` to an integer. All other variables remain unchanged.
