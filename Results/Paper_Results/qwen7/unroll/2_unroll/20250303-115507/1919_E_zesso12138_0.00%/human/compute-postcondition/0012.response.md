Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (size of the hidden array `a`), and a list `p` of `n` integers. It then calls another function `func_1(n, p)` for each test case to compute some result, stores these results in a list `results`, and finally prints each result. The function does not return any value but modifies the `results` list and prints the computed results.**
