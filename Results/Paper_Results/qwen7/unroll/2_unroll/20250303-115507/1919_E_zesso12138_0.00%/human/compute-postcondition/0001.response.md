Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a` for each test case, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order for each test case, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string received from `sys.stdin.read`.**

The code `data = input().split()` reads a single line of input from `sys.stdin.read`, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `data`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial states.
