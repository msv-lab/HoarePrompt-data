Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There is a hidden array a of size n consisting of only 1 and -1 . Let p be the
prefix sums of array a . More formally, p is an array of length n defined as
p_i = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_i . Afterwards, array p is sorted in non-
decreasing order. For example, if a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] , then p = [1, 0, -1,
0, 1] before sorting and p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] after sorting.

You are given the prefix sum array p after sorting, but you do not know what
array a is. Your task is to count the number of initial arrays a such that the
above process results in the given sorted prefix sum array p . As this number
can be large, you are only required to find it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the size of the hidden array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n
(|p_i| \le n ) — the n prefix sums of a sorted in non-decreasing order.

It is guaranteed that p_1 \le p_2 \le \ldots \le p_n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000 .

Output

For each test case, output the answer modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

In the first two test cases, the only possible arrays a for n = 1 are a = [1]
and a = [-1] . Their respective sorted prefix sum arrays p are p = [1] and p =
[-1] . Hence, there is no array a that can result in the sorted prefix sum
array p = [0] and there is exactly 1 array a that can result in the sorted
prefix sum array p = [1] .

In the third test case, it can be proven that there is no array a that could
result in the sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 1, 2] .

In the fourth test case, the 3 possible arrays a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] are:

  * a = [1, -1, 1, -1, -1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, 1, 0, -1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, -1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [-1, 0, 1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 

For the fifth test case, the only possible array a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1] is a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1] .

    #State: Output State: `dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1 where each element is equal to the binomial coefficient C(n, i) for i ranging from 0 to 2 * n, and `MOD` is the modulus used during the calculations to prevent overflow. The list starts from index 0 up to index 2 * n.

    #The program returns the binomial coefficient C(n, final_sum), where final_sum is equal to p[-1] + offset and MOD is the modulus used during the calculations to prevent overflow.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `n` (an integer between 1 and 5000) and `p` (a sorted list of integers). It calculates the binomial coefficient C(n, final_sum), where `final_sum` is the last element of the list `p` plus an offset (`n`). The calculation is done using dynamic programming and a modulus (`MOD`) is applied to prevent overflow. The function returns the computed binomial coefficient.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 representing the size of the hidden array a for each test case, and p is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order for each test case.

The length of `results` is equal to `t`. The value of `data[index]` is not specified in the loop and remains unchanged, and `data` itself is not modified by the loop.

        print(res)

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (size of the hidden array `a`), and a list `p` of `n` integers. It then calls another function `func_1(n, p)` for each test case to compute some result, stores these results in a list `results`, and finally prints each result. The function does not return any value but modifies the `results` list and prints the computed results.
