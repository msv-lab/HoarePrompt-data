Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a` for each test case, and `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order for each test case, `input` is now set to `sys.stdin.read`**.

The code `input = sys.stdin.read` simply reassigns the `input` variable to refer to the `sys.stdin.read` function. This does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or `p`. It just changes what `input` refers to.
