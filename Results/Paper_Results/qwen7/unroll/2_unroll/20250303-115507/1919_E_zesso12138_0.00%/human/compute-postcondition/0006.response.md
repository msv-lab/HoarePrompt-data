State: **`index` is 2, `t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[1])`, `results` is an empty list, `t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is just a placeholder) and the variable `t`.
2. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.
3. The initial state provides that `index` is 2, `t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[1])`, and `results` is an empty list.
4. To ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0.
