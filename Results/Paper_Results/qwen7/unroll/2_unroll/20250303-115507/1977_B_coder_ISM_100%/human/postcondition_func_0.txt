The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^4) and another positive integer \( x \) (1 ≤ \( x \) < 2^30). For each test case, it converts \( x \) into its 30-bit binary representation, modifies the binary digits according to specific rules, and then prints the modified length of the binary representation along with the modified binary digits. The modified binary digits may include '0', '1', or '-1', where '-1' indicates a specific condition was met during the processing.
