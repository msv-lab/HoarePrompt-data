Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and another positive integer `x` (1 ≤ x < 2^30). For each test case, it returns either a specific value or an error message based on the relationship between `t` and `x`.**

Note: The actual processing logic is not described here, only the parameters and the expected behavior in terms of input and output.
