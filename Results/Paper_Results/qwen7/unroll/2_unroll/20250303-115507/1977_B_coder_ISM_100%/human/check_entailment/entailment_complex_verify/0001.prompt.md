You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    1
    
    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1
    6
    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

    #State: Output State: t lines, each line containing an integer length followed by a sequence of characters either '0', '1', or '-1'. The length represents the modified length of the binary representation after processing, and the sequence shows the modified binary digits with possible '-1' placeholders indicating specific conditions were met during the loop execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^4) and another positive integer \( x \) (1 ≤ \( x \) < 2^30). For each test case, it converts \( x \) into its 30-bit binary representation, modifies the binary digits according to specific rules, and then prints the modified length of the binary representation along with the modified binary digits. The modified binary digits may include '0', '1', or '-1', where '-1' indicates a specific condition was met during the processing.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the problem requirements.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - The program constructs a list `s` representing the binary representation of `x`.
   - It iterates over the bits of `x` from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB).
   - If the bit at position `i` is set (`x & pow(2, i)`), it appends `'1'` to the list `s`; otherwise, it appends `'0'`.

3. **Adjusting the List `s`:**
   - The program then iterates over the list `s` to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.
   - It uses a flag `flag` to track whether the previous element was changed to `-1`.
   - If `flag` is set and the current element is `'0'`, it changes the current element to `'1'` and resets the flag.
   - If `flag` is not set and the current and next elements are both `'1'`, it changes the current element to `'-'` and sets the flag.
   - If the flag is set and the last element is `'0'`, it changes the last element to `'1'` and increments the length.
   - Otherwise, it ensures no two consecutive `-1` and `1` elements exist by swapping them if necessary.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the list `s` (which represents the number of elements in the array).
   - It then prints the elements of the list `s`.

### Verification

- **Binary Representation:** The program correctly constructs the binary representation of `x`.
- **Constraints on Adjacent Elements:** The program ensures that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist in the list `s`. This is achieved by the logic within the loop that adjusts the list based on the flag.
- **Output Length and Elements:** The output length and elements match the problem constraints and requirements.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the program correctly implements the required logic to generate an array of integers that satisfies the given conditions.
