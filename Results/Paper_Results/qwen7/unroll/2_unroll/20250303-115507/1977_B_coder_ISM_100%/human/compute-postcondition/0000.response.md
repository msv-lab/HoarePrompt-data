Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the value of `t` after executing the code will be the integer input provided by the user, which must fall within the specified range. All other variables remain unchanged, and the precondition that `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x < 2^{30}\) remains valid but is not affected by the given code.
