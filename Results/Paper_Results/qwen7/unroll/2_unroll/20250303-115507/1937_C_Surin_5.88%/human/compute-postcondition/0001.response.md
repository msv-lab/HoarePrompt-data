Output State: **A lambda function `I` is defined which takes no parameters and returns a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces, `R` is a lambda function that takes no parameters and returns an integer obtained from the input.**

The code defines a lambda function `R` that takes no parameters and returns an integer obtained from the input. This affects the definition of `R`. The initial state's lambda function `I` remains unchanged. Other variables like `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `x`, `y`, and the permutation `p` are not defined or modified by this code.
