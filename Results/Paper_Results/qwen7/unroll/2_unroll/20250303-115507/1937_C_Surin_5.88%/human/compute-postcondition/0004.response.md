Output State: The output state will consist of two integers separated by a space. The first integer represents the value of `prev` after the loop completes, and the second integer represents the value of `v1` after the loop completes. These values are determined by the comparisons made within the loop based on the user's input ('<' or '>').

In each iteration of the loop, `v1` is updated to `v2` if the user inputs '<', and `prev` is updated to `i` if the user inputs '>'. The final values of `prev` and `v1` after all iterations represent the output state.
