The function interacts with an external entity to perform queries and receives responses. It iterates through a sequence of comparisons based on the user's input ('<' or '>'), updating two variables `prev` and `v1` accordingly. After completing the iterations, it outputs two integers separated by a space, where the first integer is the final value of `prev` and the second integer is the final value of `v1`.
