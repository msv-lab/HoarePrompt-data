The function accepts a list of tuples `primary_items`, where each tuple contains two integers (a_i, b_i), and a list of integers `secondary_heap` representing a min-heap of differences (b_i - a_i) for each item. It calculates and returns the sum of the first elements (a_i) of all items in `primary_items` where the sum of the tuple elements (a_i + b_i) is greater than or equal to 0.
