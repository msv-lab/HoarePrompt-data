Output State: **`test_cases` is the result of `func_1()`, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `prices` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ price_i ≤ 10^9, and `bonuses` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ bonus_i ≤ 10^9.**

Explanation: The code `test_cases = func_1()` calls the function `func_1()` and assigns its return value to the variable `test_cases`. The initial values and conditions for `t`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, and `bonuses` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the assignment of `test_cases` and retains the initial conditions of the other variables.
