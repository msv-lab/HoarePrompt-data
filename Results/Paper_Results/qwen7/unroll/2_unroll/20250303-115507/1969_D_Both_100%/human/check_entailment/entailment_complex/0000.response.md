Reasoning:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \). It meets the requirement of returning an integer \( t \) where \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \).
2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function correctly reads space-separated integers from the input and returns them as a map object. However, the actual implementation should convert the map object to a list of integers before further processing. This is necessary because the subsequent functions expect lists as arguments.
3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function calculates the sum of the first elements (a_i) of all items in `primary_items` where the sum of the tuple elements (a_i + b_i) is greater than or equal to 0. The function correctly implements the logic required for this calculation.
4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**: This function processes each test case correctly. It initializes the necessary variables, reads the input values, and uses the helper functions appropriately. The logic for calculating the maximum profit is implemented as per the problem statement. Specifically:
   - It handles the case where Bob can take all items for free if Alice buys fewer than \( k \) items.
   - It uses a min-heap to manage the differences \( b_i - a_i \) and selects the optimal items to maximize Alice's profit.
   - It iterates through the items, updating the profit based on whether the combined value of \( a_i \) and \( b_i \) is non-negative.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the overall correctness of the program is verified.

Correctness: **True**
