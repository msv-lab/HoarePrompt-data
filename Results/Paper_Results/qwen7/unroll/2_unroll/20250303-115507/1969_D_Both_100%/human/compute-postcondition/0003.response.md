Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; for each test case, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n; and two lists, `prices` and `bonuses`, each containing `n` integers where 1 ≤ price_i ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ bonus_i ≤ 10^9. The function does not return anything explicitly but processes the input data according to the given constraints.**
