Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `primary_items`, which is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (a_i, b_i), and a parameter `secondary_heap`, which is a list of integers representing a min-heap of differences (b_i - a_i) for each item. It returns the sum of the first elements (a_i) of all items in `primary_items` where the sum of the tuple elements (a_i + b_i) is greater than or equal to 0.**
