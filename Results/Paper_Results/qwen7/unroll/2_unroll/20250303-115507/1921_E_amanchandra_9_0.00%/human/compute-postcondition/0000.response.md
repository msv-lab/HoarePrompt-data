Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - The loop will run for `t` iterations because `i` ranges from `0` to `t-1`.

3. **Adjust the state**:
   - The value of `t` must be within the specified range, so we need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1.

Given this information, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
