You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'Draw', 'Alice', and 'Bob' based on the conditions specified within the loop for each test case. For each test case, if `xa > xb`, the output will be 'Draw'. Otherwise, depending on the positions of `ya` and `yb` relative to the calculated range, the output will be either 'Alice' or 'Bob'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b). It checks if x_a and x_b are distinct and if y_a and y_b are distinct. Depending on the positions of (x_a, y_a) and (x_b, y_b), it outputs 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob'. If x_a > x_b, it always outputs 'Draw'. Otherwise, it calculates a range based on the distance between x_a and x_b and checks if y_a or y_b falls within this range to determine the output.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the rules of the game. Specifically, the logic for determining the outcome of the game is flawed. Here are a few issues:

1. **Incorrect Winning Condition Check**: The program checks if `xa > xb` to determine if it's a draw, which is not accurate. According to the problem description, Alice wins if she can place her chip on Bob's position, and Bob wins if he can place his chip on Alice's position. The current implementation does not check these conditions properly.

2. **Incorrect Move Logic**: The program attempts to calculate the possible moves for Alice and Bob using a simplified approach, but it does not fully consider the constraints and possible moves as described. For example, it does not correctly handle the diagonal moves for Alice or the moves for Bob.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not handle all edge cases, such as when Alice or Bob is at the boundary of the board and cannot make certain moves. The current logic does not account for these scenarios accurately.

To illustrate, let's consider a specific test case:
- Input: `6 5 2 2 5 3`
- Expected Output: `Alice` (since Alice can move to Bob's position)

However, the provided program does not correctly determine this outcome. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
