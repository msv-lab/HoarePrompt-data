Reasoning:

The provided solution has several issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Outcome**: The logic for determining the winner is flawed. Specifically, the current logic only considers the vertical distance between the two players and does not fully account for the optimal moves that each player can make.

2. **Incorrect Range Calculation**: The range calculation for `l` and `r` is incorrect. The current implementation assumes that the range is centered around `yb`, which is not necessarily true when considering the optimal moves.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The solution does not handle all edge cases properly, particularly when the players are close to the boundaries of the board.

4. **Inconsistent Output Formatting**: The output formatting is inconsistent. The use of `print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[...])` is unnecessary and can be simplified.

Given these issues, let's analyze the correct approach:

- **Alice's Moves**: Alice can move down, down-right, or down-left. This means she can potentially reduce the vertical distance between herself and Bob.
- **Bob's Moves**: Bob can move up, up-right, or up-left. This means he can potentially increase the vertical distance between himself and Alice.

The key insight is that if Alice can always force the game into a position where Bob is forced to move into a cell that Alice can capture, Alice will win. Conversely, if Bob can always force the game into a position where Alice is forced to move into a cell that Bob can capture, Bob will win.

Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb = map(int, input().split())
        
        if xa == xb:
            if ya < yb:
                print('Alice')
            elif ya > yb:
                print('Bob')
            else:
                print('Draw')
        else:
            if abs(xa - xb) % 2 == 0:
                if abs(ya - yb) <= abs(xa - xb) // 2:
                    print('Alice')
                else:
                    print('Bob')
            else:
                if abs(ya - yb) <= abs(xa - xb) // 2 + 1:
                    print('Alice')
                else:
                    print('Bob')

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected logic handles all the necessary cases and ensures that the players' moves are considered correctly. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
