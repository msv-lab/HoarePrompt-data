Reasoning:
The provided program checks whether the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd. Based on the rules of the game, the player who ends up with an empty wallet first loses. If the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even, then Bob will win; otherwise, Alice will win. This logic aligns with the optimal strategy for the game as described in the problem statement.

Given that the program correctly implements the rule that the player whose number of coins differs by an even amount from their opponent's will lose, the program is correct according to the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
