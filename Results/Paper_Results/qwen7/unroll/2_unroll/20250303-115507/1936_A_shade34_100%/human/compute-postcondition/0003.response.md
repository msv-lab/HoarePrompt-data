Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns indices \(i\) and \(j\) that maximize \(p_i \oplus p_j\), where \(p\) is a permutation of length \(n\) determined through at most \(3n\) queries.**

This means the function interacts with an external entity to determine a permutation \(p\) of length \(n\). It then finds and returns indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that the bitwise XOR of elements at these indices, \(p_i \oplus p_j\), is maximized. The function makes no more than \(3n\) queries to determine the permutation and find the optimal indices.
