None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the provided function signature. However, the problem requires interacting with an external entity to determine the permutation \( p \) and find indices \( i \) and \( j \) that maximize \( p_i \oplus p_j \). The interaction involves making at most \( 3n \) queries, where \( n \) is the length of the permutation.
