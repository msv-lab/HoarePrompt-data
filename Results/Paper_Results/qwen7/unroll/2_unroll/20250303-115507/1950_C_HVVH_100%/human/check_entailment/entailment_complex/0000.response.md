Reasoning:
- The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and iterates over each test case.
- For each test case, it correctly splits the input string `s` into hours `h` and minutes `m`.
- The logic for converting 24-hour format to 12-hour format is mostly correct:
  - If `h` is 0, it correctly sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'.
  - If `h` is greater than 12, it correctly sets `h` to `h - 12` and `day` to 'PM'.
  - If `h` is 12, it correctly sets `day` to 'PM'.
  - For other values of `h`, it correctly sets `day` to 'AM'.
- The function prints the converted time in the correct format.
- The function does not modify the `t` variable, which is consistent with the problem statement.
- The function does not return any value, which is also consistent with the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the function correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
