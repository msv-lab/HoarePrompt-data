Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It then iterates over each test case, splitting the input string `s` into hours `h` and minutes `m`.
3. The logic for converting the 24-hour format to 12-hour format is as follows:
   - If `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'.
   - Otherwise, it sets `day` to 'AM', and if `h` is 12, it changes `day` to 'PM'.
4. The program prints the converted time in the correct format.
5. The logic handles all edge cases correctly, including when `h` is 0 (midnight), 12 (noon), and values between 1 and 11.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the program appears to handle all cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
