Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of buns, `a` is a positive integer representing the usual price of a bun, `b` is a positive integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, `low` is 0, and `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`.**

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables, `low` and `high`. The value of `low` is set to 0, and the value of `high` is set to the minimum of `n` and `b`. All other variables (`n`, `a`, and `b`) retain their initial values.
