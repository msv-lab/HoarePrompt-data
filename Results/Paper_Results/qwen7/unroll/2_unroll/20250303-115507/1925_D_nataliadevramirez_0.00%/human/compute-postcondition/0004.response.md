Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a group of children, their friendships, and the number of excursions. For each test case, it calls the `func_1` function with the relevant parameters (number of children, number of friendships, number of excursions, and the list of friendships). After processing each test case, it prints the result returned by `func_1`. The function ultimately outputs the results of `func_1` for all test cases.**
