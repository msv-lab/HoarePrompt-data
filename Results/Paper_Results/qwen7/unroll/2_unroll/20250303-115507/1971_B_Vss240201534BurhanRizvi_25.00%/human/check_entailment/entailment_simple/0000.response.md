Reasoning:
1. The problem requires rearranging the characters of a given string `s` to form a new string `r` that is different from `s`. If no such rearrangement is possible, the program should output "NO".
2. The provided solution uses the `random.sample` function to generate a new string `s2` by shuffling the characters of `s`.
3. The program checks if `s` is not equal to `s2`. If they are not equal, it prints "Yes" followed by `s2`, which is a valid rearrangement of `s`.
4. If `s` is equal to `s2`, it prints "No", indicating that no valid rearrangement was found (which is not possible since `s2` is a permutation of `s`).
5. The logic in the provided solution is sound because `random.sample` ensures that `s2` is a valid rearrangement of `s`, and the check `if s != s2:` correctly identifies when `s2` is different from `s`.

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
