Output State: **For each test case, either 'Yes' followed by a randomly shuffled version of the input string or 'No' is printed. The exact output depends on the input string for each test case.**

This means that for each input string `s`, the program will either print 'Yes' followed by a randomly shuffled version of `s` (if `s` is not equal to its shuffled version) or 'No' (if `s` is equal to its shuffled version). The specific shuffled version will vary due to the random sampling.
