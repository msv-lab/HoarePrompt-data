You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    print(func_1(n, m, a))

def func_1(n, m, a):
    count = [0] * 7
    for char in a:
        count[ord(char) - ord('A')] += 1
    needed_problems = 0
    for i in range(7):
        if count[i] < m:
            needed_problems += m - count[i]
    return needed_problems



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts three parameters: n (an integer between 1 and 50), m (an integer between 1 and 5), and a (a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'). It counts the occurrences of each character in the string a and calculates how many additional problems are needed so that each character type has at least m occurrences. Regardless of the input, the function always returns 7.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the string `a` representing the difficulties of the existing problems.
3. The function `func_1` is called with these parameters.
4. Inside `func_1`:
   - It initializes an array `count` of size 7 to zero, which will store the count of each difficulty level.
   - It iterates through the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in `count` for each character.
   - It then calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level by checking if the count of any difficulty level is less than `m`. If it is, it adds the difference (`m - count[i]`) to `needed_problems`.
   - Finally, it returns `needed_problems`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the code, the program appears to correctly calculate the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure that he can conduct `m` rounds with at least one problem of each required difficulty level.
