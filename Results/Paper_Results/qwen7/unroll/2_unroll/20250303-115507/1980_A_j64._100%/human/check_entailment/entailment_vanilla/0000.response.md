Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the string `a` representing the difficulties of the existing problems.
3. The function `func_1` is called with these parameters.
4. Inside `func_1`:
   - It initializes an array `count` of size 7 to zero, which will store the count of each difficulty level.
   - It iterates through the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in `count` for each character.
   - It then calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level by checking if the count of any difficulty level is less than `m`. If it is, it adds the difference (`m - count[i]`) to `needed_problems`.
   - Finally, it returns `needed_problems`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the code, the program appears to correctly calculate the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure that he can conduct `m` rounds with at least one problem of each required difficulty level.

Correctness: **True**
