Postcondition: `dp` is a list of length `n` where either the first element is 1 and all other elements are 0, or the first element is `-inf` and all other elements are 0. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 0, and `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Additionally, `path[0]` is either '@' or '*'.
