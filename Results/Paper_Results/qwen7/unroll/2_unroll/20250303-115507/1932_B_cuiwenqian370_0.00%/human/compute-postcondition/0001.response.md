Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string received from `sys.stdin.read` on whitespace.**

Explanation: The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was already defined in the initial state. The new variable `data` is created and assigned the result of splitting the input string (read from `sys.stdin.read`) on whitespace. Since the exact input is not specified, `data` is described as a list of strings resulting from the split operation.
