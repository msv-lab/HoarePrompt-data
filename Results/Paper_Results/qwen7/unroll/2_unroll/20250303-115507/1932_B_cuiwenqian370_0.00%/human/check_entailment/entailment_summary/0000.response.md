Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the year when the nth sign will occur, based on the periodicity of each sign and the sequential occurrence condition.
2. The provided code does not actually solve the problem as described. Instead, it appears to be implementing a solution for a different problem (likely a variation of the longest valid parentheses problem).
3. Specifically, `func_1` is designed to process a string of characters (`@` and `*`) and compute a value based on those characters using dynamic programming, which is unrelated to the given problem.
4. `func_2` reads input and calls `func_1` for each test case, but since `func_1` is not solving the intended problem, the overall program is incorrect.

Given this analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem described.

Correctness: **False**
