### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(path)` is designed to process a sequence of characters (`@` or `*`) to determine the year when the nth sign will occur.
   - The logic inside the function seems to be incorrect for the problem statement. The function is using a dynamic programming approach but with a different interpretation of the problem.
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly simulate the waiting period for each sign to occur sequentially. Instead, it appears to be trying to find a pattern in a sequence of characters (`@` or `*`), which is not relevant to the problem.

2. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2()` reads the input, processes each test case, and calls `func_1()` for each test case.
   - However, since `func_1()` is not correctly implemented to solve the problem, the overall correctness of `func_2()` is also questionable.

3. **Problem Description**:
   - The problem requires finding the year when the nth sign will occur based on the periodicity of each sign. This should involve calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities of the signs.
   - The provided functions do not perform this calculation correctly.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided functions do not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
