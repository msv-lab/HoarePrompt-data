Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first element in the list `data`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string received from `sys.stdin.read` on whitespace, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `results = []` initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `data`, or `index`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and `results` is now an empty list.
