### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The problem requires determining the year in which all \( n \) signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially. Each sign occurs periodically, and the next sign can only occur strictly after the previous one.
   - The goal is to find the year when the last sign (the \( n \)-th sign) will occur, considering the periodicities of all previous signs.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function is indeed irrelevant to the problem. It deals with a string of characters ('@' and '*'), which is not related to the periodicities of the signs. Therefore, it should be removed.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case. Since `func_1` is not relevant, the function `func_2` is also not correctly implementing the solution.

3. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To solve the problem, we need to compute the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities of the signs. The LCM of a set of numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of each of the numbers in the set.
   - For each test case, we need to read the number of signs \( n \) and their periodicities \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \).
   - We then compute the LCM of these periodicities.
   - Finally, we output the LCM for each test case.

4. **Given Code Issues**:
   - The function `func_1` is completely unrelated to the problem and should be removed.
   - The function `func_2` attempts to process the input but incorrectly uses `func_1`, which is not designed to solve the problem.

5. **Correct Solution**:
   - We need to modify the code to correctly compute the LCM of the periodicities and output the result.

### Corrected Code Example:
```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def compute_lcm(numbers):
    lcm_value = numbers[0]
    for number in numbers[1:]:
        lcm_value = lcm(lcm_value, number)
    return lcm_value

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index+n]))
        index += n
        results.append(compute_lcm(a))
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

### Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly identified that the given code is incorrect because `func_1` is irrelevant and `func_2` uses `func_1` incorrectly.
- The corrected code removes `func_1` and implements a correct approach using the LCM calculation.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the presence of an irrelevant function and the incorrect use of another function. The corrected code needs to be implemented as shown above.
