Reasoning:
- The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for finding the lexicographically smallest string and counting the number of such paths.
- The program does not handle all possible cases for constructing the lexicographically smallest string.
- The logic inside `func_1()` is flawed and does not ensure that the smallest possible string is generated and counted correctly.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:
1. **Incorrect Initialization and Path Construction**:
   - The program attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest string by checking specific conditions but does not handle all possible scenarios.
   - It does not properly account for the possibility of both rows contributing to the smallest string.

2. **Path Count Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of paths that yield the smallest string incorrectly. It assumes a linear approach which does not consider the dynamic nature of the problem.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the string `s` and the count `t` but does not ensure that `s` is the lexicographically smallest string and `t` is the correct count of such paths.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
