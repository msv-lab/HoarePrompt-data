Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each line containing 'Yes' followed by a string s2. The value of s2 is either a randomly shuffled version of the input string s, or a cyclically shifted version of s (s[1:] + s[0]) if the shuffled version is the same as the original string s. The number of such lines will be equal to the number of test cases provided as input. Each test case is defined by a string s of length at most 10, and the output for each test case adheres to the conditions specified in the loop body.
