You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each line containing 'Yes' followed by a string s2. The value of s2 is either a randomly shuffled version of the input string s, or a cyclically shifted version of s (s[1:] + s[0]) if the shuffled version is the same as the original string s. The number of such lines will be equal to the number of test cases provided as input. Each test case is defined by a string s of length at most 10, and the output for each test case adheres to the conditions specified in the loop body.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a test case where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. The function returns a result based on the given conditions for `t` and `s`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
