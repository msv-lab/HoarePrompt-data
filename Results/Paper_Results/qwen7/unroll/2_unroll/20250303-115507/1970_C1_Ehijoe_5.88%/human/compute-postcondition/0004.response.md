Output State: `empty` is False, `t` is an input integer, `u` and `v` are integers between 1 and `n` after each iteration of the loop, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 × 10^5, and `tree` is a deque containing integers from 1 to `n`. The deque is constructed based on the input pairs `(u, v)` such that each pair adds one of its elements to the deque depending on the position of the other element.
