Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n - 1)`.
   - This means `i` will take values from 0 to `n-2`.
   - The variable `i` is being initialized to 0 and incremented by 1 in each iteration.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, we need to set `i` to 0.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n - 1`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

4. **Check other variables**: The other variables (`empty`, `t`, `u`, `v`, and `n`) are not directly involved in the loop condition or initialization. They do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider the state of the `tree` deque**: The `tree` is initially an empty deque, and its state does not affect the loop condition. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the `tree`.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `i` being set to 0 and `i` being less than `n - 1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `i` must be less than `n - 1`**
