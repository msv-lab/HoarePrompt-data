Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but works with predefined integer variables n, t, u, v, and a list containing exactly one integer u_1. It returns a specific value based on the conditions provided.**

This means the function `func_1` does not take any parameters when called directly but operates on predefined variables `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, and a list containing exactly one integer `u_1`. The function checks the conditions on these variables and returns a specific value accordingly.
