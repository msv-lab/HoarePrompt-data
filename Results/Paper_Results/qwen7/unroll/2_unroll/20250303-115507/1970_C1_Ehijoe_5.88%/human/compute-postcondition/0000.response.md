Output State: **`t` is 1, `u` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 × 10^5. After executing the code, `n` and `t` are updated to the values entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `n, t = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `t` respectively. Since the initial state specified that `t` is 1, the value of `t` remains unchanged. The initial state also specifies ranges for `n`, `u`, and `v`. After the code executes, `n` and `t` are updated to the values entered by the user, while `u` and `v` retain their initial constraints.
