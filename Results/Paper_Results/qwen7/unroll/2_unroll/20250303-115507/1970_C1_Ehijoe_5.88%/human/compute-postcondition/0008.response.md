Output State: **`empty` is False, `t` remains the same input integer, `u` and `v` are integers that were processed during the loop, `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 × 10^5, `tree` is a deque containing integers `u` and `v` from the input, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, `moves` is a list containing two elements, each element being the minimum of `t` and either `idx` or `n - idx - 1`.**

This output state reflects that the `moves` list has been updated with two elements, both of which are the minimum of `t` and either `idx` or `n - idx - 1`. All other variables retain their initial or previously described states.
