Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is iterating over each character in the string `sChar`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since `i` is being used to iterate over each character in `sChar`, before the loop starts, `i` should be set to the first character of `sChar`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `sChar`**: `sChar` is a binary string, and it must contain at least one character for the loop to execute.

4. **Initial state of `s`**: The list `s` is already given as an empty list, and this state does not need to be adjusted since it is not part of the loop head.

Based on these steps, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `i` should be the first character of `sChar`.
- `sChar` must be a non-empty binary string.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the first character of `sChar`**.
