State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, tc is 1**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `tc` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
2. The loop condition is `range(t)`, which means the loop will run `t` times.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
4. Since `tc` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the initial value of `tc` should be 1 to ensure the loop runs at least once.
5. The value of `t` must also be within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these conditions.
