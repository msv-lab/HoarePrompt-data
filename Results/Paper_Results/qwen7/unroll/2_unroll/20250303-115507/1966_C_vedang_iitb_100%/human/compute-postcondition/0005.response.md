Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of integers `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It calculates the maximum value in the list `a`, sorts the list, and determines the smallest missing positive integer. Based on the comparison between this smallest missing positive integer and the maximum value in the list, it prints either "Alice" or "Bob" with a condition based on whether the smallest missing positive integer is even or odd. The function does not return any value but outputs a sequence of strings "Alice" or "Bob" for each test case.**
