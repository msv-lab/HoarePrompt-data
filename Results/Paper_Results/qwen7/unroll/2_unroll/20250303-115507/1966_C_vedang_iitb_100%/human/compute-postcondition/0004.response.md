Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n). It returns a result based on the given inputs for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t`, another positive integer `n`, and a list of `n` integers. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case without requiring the test cases to be passed as parameters directly.
