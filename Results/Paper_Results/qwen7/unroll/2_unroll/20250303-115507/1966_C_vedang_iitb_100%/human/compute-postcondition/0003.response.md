Output State: The output state will consist of a series of strings printed based on the conditions inside the loop. For each iteration of the loop (from `tc` in `range(t)`), the program reads an integer `n`, followed by a list of integers `a`. It then calculates the maximum value (`maxsize`) in the list `a`, sorts the list, and finds the smallest missing positive integer (`mexsize`). Depending on the comparison between `mexsize` and `maxsize`, it prints either "Alice" or "Bob" with a condition based on whether `mexsize` is even or odd. The output state will be a sequence of these printed strings, one for each iteration of the loop.
