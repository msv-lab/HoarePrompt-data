Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues:

1. **Function `func_1` is not called correctly**: The function `func_1` is defined but never actually called within the loop that processes each test case. Instead of calling `func_1()`, you should call `func_1()` with the appropriate arguments from the input.

2. **Incorrect logic for finding the maximum balance**: The current logic tries to find the maximum balance by checking divisors of `x` and comparing them with `n`. However, the logic to calculate the maximum GCD (balance) is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the case where `x // i` is less than `n`.

3. **Missing return statement**: The program should return the result for each test case, but it simply prints the result directly without returning it.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func_1(x, n):
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    return ans

tc = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(tc):
    x, n = map(int, input().split())
    results.append(func_1(x, n))

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected version properly calls `func_1` with the correct parameters for each test case and returns the results, ensuring the program works as intended.
