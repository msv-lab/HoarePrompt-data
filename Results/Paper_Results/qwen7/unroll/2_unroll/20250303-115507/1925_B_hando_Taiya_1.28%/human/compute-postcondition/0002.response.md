Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `isqrt(x) + 1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 1 (as specified in the range function).

3. **Determine the value of `isqrt(x) + 1`**: The variable `isqrt(x)` represents the integer square root of `x`, and adding 1 to it gives the upper bound of the range. This means `i` will iterate from 1 up to `isqrt(x) + 1`.

4. **Check the constraints**: We know that `1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8` and `1 ≤ n ≤ x`. Since `n` is within this range, `isqrt(x) + 1` will be a positive integer.

5. **Adjust the states**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure that `isqrt(x) + 1` is a positive integer and that `i` starts at 1. The initial state of `t`, `x`, and `n` does not directly affect the loop execution but should be consistent with the given constraints.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be 1.
- `isqrt(x) + 1` should be a positive integer.

Since `x` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^8\), `isqrt(x) + 1` will always be a positive integer. Therefore, we don't need to explicitly state that `isqrt(x) + 1` is a positive integer because it inherently follows from the constraints on `x`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1**
