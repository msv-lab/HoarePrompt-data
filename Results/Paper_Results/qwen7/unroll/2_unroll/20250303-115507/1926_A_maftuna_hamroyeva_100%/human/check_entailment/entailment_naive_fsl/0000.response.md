Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each test case and prints the character that appears most frequently. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the program handles all possible inputs correctly. Since the string length is fixed at 5 and the characters are either 'A' or 'B', the logic to count and compare the frequencies works without any issues. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for all potential cases.
