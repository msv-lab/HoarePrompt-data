You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        l = 0
        h = 0
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'. It counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string. If the count of 'A' is greater than the count of 'B', it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **String Counting**: For each test case, the program counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' using two counters `l` and `h`, respectively.
3. **Comparison and Output**: After counting, the program compares the counts of 'A' and 'B'. If the count of 'A' is greater than the count of 'B', it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'.
4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles all edge cases where the string can be composed of any combination of 'A' and 'B', including cases with equal counts of 'A' and 'B'. However, since the problem specifies that the string is of length 5, there will always be a clear majority (at least 3 out of 5 characters will be the same), so the program does not need to handle the case where `l` equals `h`.
5. **Output Format**: The program outputs the correct character for each test case as per the problem statement.

Given that the program follows the problem requirements accurately and handles all possible test cases correctly, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
