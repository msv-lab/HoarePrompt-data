Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case, reading a string of length 5.
3. For each string, it counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'.
4. It compares the counts and prints 'A' if there are more 'A's, and 'B' otherwise.
5. The logic is sound and matches the problem description.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
