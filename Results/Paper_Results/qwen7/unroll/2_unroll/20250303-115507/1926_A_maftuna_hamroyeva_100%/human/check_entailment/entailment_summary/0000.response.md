Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads a string of length 5.
3. It initializes two counters, `l` and `h`, to count the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' respectively.
4. It iterates through each character in the string, updating the counters accordingly.
5. After counting the occurrences, it compares the counts and prints the appropriate character ('A' or 'B').
6. The logic for determining which character appears more frequently is correct.
7. The program does not return any value after processing all test cases, but this is acceptable since the problem does not require a return value.

Given the execution summary and the reasoning above, the program behaves as expected and correctly solves the problem.

Correctness: **True**
