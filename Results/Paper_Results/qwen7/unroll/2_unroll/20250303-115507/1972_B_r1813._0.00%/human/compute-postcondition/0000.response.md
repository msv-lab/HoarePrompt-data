Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length n consisting of only "U" and "D", and the function `input = sys.stdin.read` has been assigned to the variable `input`.**

The code `input = sys.stdin.read` assigns the function `sys.stdin.read` to the variable `input`. This does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`, but it does change the behavior of the `input` variable to read from standard input instead of using the built-in `input` function.
