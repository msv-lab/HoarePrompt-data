Output State: **index** is 4, **t** is an integer obtained from `data[1]`, **n** is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, **s** is a string of length n consisting of only "U" and "D", **results** is a list where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether the count of 'U' in `s` is odd or even for each iteration of the loop, **index** has not changed and remains 4, **t** has not changed and remains the integer obtained from `data[1]`, **n** has not changed and remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, **s** has not changed and remains a string of length n consisting of only "U" and "D", and the **results** list has been printed for each of its elements.
