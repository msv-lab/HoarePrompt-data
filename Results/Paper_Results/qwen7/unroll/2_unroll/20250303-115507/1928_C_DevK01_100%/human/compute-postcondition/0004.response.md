Output State: **`q` is an integer representing the position Vasya occupied in the line, `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling, both `q` and `x` satisfy 1 ≤ `x` < `q` ≤ 10^9; `M` is a list containing the value of `w`, `w` is the square root of `q` and is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`; `w` is the square root of `q`.**

Explanation: The code `M += [w]` appends the value of `w` (which is the square root of `q` and an integer) to the list `M`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `M` now contains the value of `w`, and `w` remains the square root of `q` and is an integer greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
