Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly generate the required checkerboard patterns for values of \( n \) greater than 4. According to the problem statement, the checkerboard should alternate between `#` and `.` in a 2x2 pattern for each \( 2n \times 2n \) block. However, the program only handles specific cases for \( n = 1, 2, 3, \) and \( 4 \). For any other value of \( n \), it simply prints "No esta en el rango" (which means "Not in the range"), which is incorrect because it should generate the appropriate checkerboard pattern.

For example, for \( n = 5 \), the expected output would be a 10x10 checkerboard, but the program does not handle this case correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
