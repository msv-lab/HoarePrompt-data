### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Constraints Handling**:
   - The program correctly parses the input to separate constraints into three lists: `big` (for constraints of type 1), `less` (for constraints of type 2), and `no` (for constraints of type 3).
   - It then calculates the potential range of values for `k` by finding the minimum value from `less` and the maximum value from `big`. This range is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`.

2. **Handling Overlapping Constraints**:
   - The program correctly checks if any value in `no` falls within the range `[max(big), min(less)]`. If it does, it subtracts 1 from the count, adjusting the final result accordingly.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the range `[max(big), min(less)]` is empty (i.e., `num < 1`) by printing `0`.

4. **Guarantees**:
   - The problem guarantees that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, ensuring that the range `[max(big), min(less)]` is always non-empty.
   - The program correctly adjusts for overlapping constraints by iterating through `no` and subtracting 1 for each value that falls within the range.

Given these points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.
