Reasoning:
1. The program correctly categorizes the constraints into three lists: `big` for constraints of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to some integer x), `less` for constraints of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to some integer x), and `no` for constraints of type 3 (k must be not equal to some integer x).
2. The program calculates the initial range of possible values for k by finding the difference between the minimum value in the `less` list and the maximum value in the `big` list, adding 1 to include both endpoints. This calculation is correct.
3. The program then iterates through the `no` list to check if any of these values are excluded from the range. If an element in the `no` list falls within the calculated range, it subtracts one from the count of possible values, which is correct.
4. The program handles the case where the range is invalid (i.e., when the minimum value in the `less` list is less than the maximum value in the `big` list) by printing 0, which is correct.
5. The program does not return anything explicitly but prints the result directly, which is appropriate for the problem statement.

Given the above points, the program logic matches the problem description and the execution summary accurately.

Correctness: **True**
