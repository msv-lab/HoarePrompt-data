Output State: **`loop` is an input integer between 1 and 500, inclusive, and all other variables retain their initial conditions.**

Explanation: The code `loop = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `loop`. The initial conditions for `t` and the constraints remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), and the constraints are still as described, with `loop` now holding the value input by the user.
