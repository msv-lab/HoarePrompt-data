You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

    loop = int(input())

        big = []
        no = []

        if num < 1:
            print(0)
            continue
        for i in no:
            if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
                num -= 1
        print(num)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a set of constraints. For each test case, it categorizes integers into three lists based on their types (big, less, no). It then calculates the number of integers in the 'no' list that fall within the range defined by the minimum of the 'less' list and the maximum of the 'big' list, adjusting this count by subtracting one for each such integer. If the resulting count is less than 1, it prints 0; otherwise, it prints the count. The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing explicitly, but its output is printed during execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the `no` list (which contains values that `k` must not be equal to) overlaps with the range defined by `big` and `less`. Specifically, if there is a value in `no` that lies between the minimum of `less` and the maximum of `big`, the program will incorrectly subtract it from the count without considering that this value should not be included in the final count.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
3 10
1 5
2 15
3 12
```
- The constraints are: \( k \geq 10 \), \( k \leq 5 \), \( k \neq 12 \).
- The program calculates the range as \( 5 - 10 + 1 = -5 \), which is incorrect because it should be 0 since there are no valid values for \( k \).

However, the program does not account for the fact that 12 is not a valid value for \( k \) within the range [5, 10], so it should not be subtracted from the count. This oversight leads to incorrect results in cases where the `no` list intersects with the range defined by `big` and `less`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that values in `no` that fall within the range defined by `big` and `less` are excluded from the count.
