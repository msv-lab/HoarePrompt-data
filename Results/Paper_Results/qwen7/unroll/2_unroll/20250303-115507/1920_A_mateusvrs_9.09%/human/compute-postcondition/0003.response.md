Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `r` is a list containing integers calculated based on the conditions inside the loop. Each element in the list `r` is determined by the following logic:

1. For each test case (`t` iterations):
   - Read an integer `n`.
   - Initialize `cx` as an empty set, `ax` as 1000000000 (a large prime number), and `bx` as -1.
   - For each of the next `n` integers:
     - If the first integer `a` is 1, update `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and `bx`.
     - If the first integer `a` is 2, update `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
     - Otherwise, add `x` to the set `cx`.
   - If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, append 0 to the list `r`.
   - Otherwise, count how many elements in `cx` fall within the range `[bx, ax]` and subtract this count from `ax - bx + 1`. Append the result to the list `r`.

Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `r` is a list of integers.
