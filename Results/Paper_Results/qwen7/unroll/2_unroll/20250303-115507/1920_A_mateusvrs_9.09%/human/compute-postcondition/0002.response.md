State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 500, `r` is an empty list, `_` is 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is used as a placeholder) and the variable `t`.
2. The loop will execute if `t` is a positive integer greater than 0.
3. Since `t` is given to be an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), this condition must be satisfied for the loop to execute.
4. The variable `r` is mentioned but does not affect the loop's execution condition directly.
5. The placeholder `_` is set to 0 at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is within the specified range and `_` is initialized to 0.
