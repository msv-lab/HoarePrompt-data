Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), but `t` is not used in the print statement.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `n` is greater than `k`.
- The condition \((k - 1 < n - k + 1)\) is satisfied.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(n - k + 1, 1)`.

First, let's simplify the expression `n - k + 1`:
- Since `n` is greater than `k`, the expression `n - k + 1` will yield an integer value that is greater than 0.

Second, the number `1` is explicitly printed as is.

Therefore, the print statement will output two values separated by a space: the value of `n - k + 1` and `1`.

Output: **n - k + 1 1**
