Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs and converts them to integers, assigning them to `n` and `k` respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is an integer between 1 and 1000.
