### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Basic Cases**:
   - If `n < k`, Alice cannot buy `k` jewels, so the output should be "NO".
   - If `n == k`, Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by spending all her coins in one stall, so the output should be "YES" with one stall and the price equal to `n`.
3. **Intermediate Case**:
   - If `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, it means Alice can buy one jewel from the first `k-1` stalls and use the remaining coins to buy one more jewel in the last stall. This scenario is handled correctly by printing "YES" with two stalls and appropriate prices.
4. **General Case**:
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it is impossible to achieve exactly `k` jewels, so the output should be "NO". However, the provided code incorrectly handles this case by always returning "NO" when the condition `k - 1 >= n - k + 1` is not met.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to handle the general case correctly. It should allow Bob to set up more than two stalls if necessary, but the current implementation only considers two stalls. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
