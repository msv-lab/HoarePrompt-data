Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution attempts to calculate the maximum number of points you can get, but it contains a logical error. Specifically, the logic for calculating the maximum points you can get is flawed.

Hereâ€™s why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The code calculates `ans` as the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for each count `x` in `cnt`. This approach does not correctly simulate the game dynamics where Nene always tries to minimize your score while maximizing hers.

2. **Optimal Strategy for Nene**: Nene will try to prevent you from scoring points by placing cards on the table when possible. The current logic does not account for this strategic behavior.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to simulate the game properly. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Count occurrences of each card value
        cnt = [0] * (n + 1)
        for x in a:
            cnt[x] += 1
        
        # Sort the counts in descending order
        cnt.sort(reverse=True)
        
        # Initialize variables
        my_points = 0
        nene_points = 0
        nene_turn = False
        
        # Simulate the game
        for i in range(n):
            if nene_turn:
                # Nene's turn
                if cnt[i] > 1:
                    nene_points += 1
                    cnt[i] -= 1
                nene_turn = False
            else:
                # Your turn
                if cnt[i] > 1:
                    my_points += 1
                    cnt[i] -= 1
                nene_turn = True
        
        print(my_points)

# Example usage
func()
```

This solution correctly simulates the game by alternating turns between you and Nene, ensuring that Nene always plays optimally to minimize your score while maximizing hers.
