t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the list of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n represents the integers on the cards in your hand, where each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
