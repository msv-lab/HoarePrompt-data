Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `_`, but since it is a dummy variable (often used as a placeholder), we don't need to adjust its state.

2. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**: The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `int(input())` provides a valid number of iterations. Specifically, the input should be an integer within the range `[1, 10^4]`.

3. **Adjust the state accordingly**: We need to ensure that the input provided is a valid integer within the specified range.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- The list `a` contains `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\) and each integer from 1 through `n` appears in `a` at most twice.
- The sum of all `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `input` is now set to `sys.stdin.readline`.

Since the loop depends on the value of `int(input())`, we need to ensure that the input is a valid integer within the range `[1, 10^4]`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input itself.

**State:**
**`input` must be an integer within the range [1, 10^4]**
