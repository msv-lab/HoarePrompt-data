Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly reverses the input lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` before processing them.
   - It initializes `soma_b` and `pref` to 0.
   - It iterates through the first `n - k` elements of the reversed lists and accumulates the cost when it finds that `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`.
   - It then iterates through the remaining elements from `n - k` to `n-1` and calculates the minimum cost to move Kirill to a position within the first `m` positions.
   - The logic for calculating the minimum cost is sound and aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases (`numero_testes`) and then calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The state transitions and the logic for handling each test case are consistent with the problem requirements.

Given the analysis above, both functions collectively meet the problem's requirements and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
