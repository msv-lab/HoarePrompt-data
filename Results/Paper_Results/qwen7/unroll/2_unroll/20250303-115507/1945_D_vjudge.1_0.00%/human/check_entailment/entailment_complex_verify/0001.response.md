### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves determining the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in a queue.
   - Kirill can swap positions with anyone in front of him, paying `a_j` coins for the initial swap and `b_k` coins for each subsequent swap between `j` and `k`.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes input parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is the total number of people in the queue (excluding Kirill), and `k` is the maximum allowable final position for Kirill.
   - It reads two lists of integers, `lista_A` and `lista_B`, which represent the costs `a_i` and `b_i` for each person in the queue.
   - The function reverses these lists, which is unnecessary since the original order is used in the logic.
   - It initializes `soma_b` to 0 and `pref` to 0.
   - It iterates through the first `n-k` elements of the reversed lists:
     - If `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, it updates `pref` by adding `soma_b` and `lista_A[i]`, setting `soma_b` to 0.
     - Otherwise, it adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b`.
   - It then iterates through the last `k` elements of the reversed lists:
     - For each element, it calculates the minimum cost by adding `pref`, `soma_b`, and `lista_A[i]`.
     - It updates `soma_b` by adding `lista_B[i]`.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum cost.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly computes the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions.
   - The reversal of the lists is unnecessary and does not affect the correctness of the algorithm.
   - The approach of iterating through the first `n-k` elements and then the last `k` elements ensures that all necessary swaps are considered.
   - The use of `pref` and `soma_b` correctly accumulates the costs as required.
   - However, there is a critical issue in the logic. The function assumes that `pref` and `soma_b` are correctly updated, but the way they are updated might not always reflect the optimal path for Kirill to move to the desired position. Specifically, the function does not consider all possible paths for Kirill to move to the first `m` positions efficiently.

4. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - The function does not ensure that the minimum cost is computed by considering all possible paths for Kirill to move to the first `m` positions. The current logic only considers moving directly to the first `m` positions without considering intermediate swaps that might lead to a lower cost.
   - The function assumes that the cost calculation is correct by simply summing up the costs in a linear fashion, which might not always yield the minimum cost.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the solution to the problem because it does not consider all possible paths for Kirill to move to the first `m` positions efficiently.
   - The function `func_2` correctly calls `func_1` for each test case, but since `func_1` is incorrect, the overall solution is flawed.
