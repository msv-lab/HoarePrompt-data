You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: After reviewing the provided program and the problem description, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number \( k \) of valid segment pairs as described. Here’s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes necessary variables and reads the input values for \( n \) and \( x \) correctly.
2. **Bitwise Analysis**: The program iterates over bits from the most significant bit (29) to the least significant bit (0). For each bit position, it checks whether the corresponding bit in \( x \) is set and whether the cumulative count of set bits in the array \( a \) for that bit position is even or odd.
3. **Segment Pairing Logic**:
   - If both the bit in \( x \) and the cumulative count of set bits in the array are zero, the program skips this bit.
   - If the bit in \( x \) is zero and the cumulative count is odd, the program processes the array to find valid segment pairs.
   - If the bit in \( x \) is one and the cumulative count is odd, the program continues to the next bit.
   - If the cumulative count is zero, the program breaks out of the loop since no further segments can be added.
4. **Segment Pair Calculation**: The program uses a dynamic approach to calculate the maximum number of valid segment pairs for each bit position and updates the result accordingly.
5. **Final Result**: The program returns the maximum number of valid segment pairs found or -1 if no valid pairs exist.

Given the complexity of the problem and the detailed logic implemented, the program handles various edge cases and follows the problem description accurately. No specific counterexample was found where the program fails to meet the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
