You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, x) is a tuple of two integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ x < 2^30, and a is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30.
def func_5():
    n, x = func_3()
    a = func_1()
    t, ans = [], -1
    for i in range(29, -1, -1):
        u, v = x >> i & 1, sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])
        
        if u == v == 0:
            continue
        
        if u == 0:
            if v % 2:
                return ans
            else:
                op = ai = 0
                for val in a:
                    op ^= val >> i & 1
                    ai ^= val
                    if not op:
                        t.append(ai)
                        ai = 0
                a, t = t, []
        elif v % 2:
            continue
        elif v:
            op = cnt = 0
            for val in a:
                op ^= val >> i & 1
                if not op:
                    cnt += 1
            ans = max(ans, cnt)
        else:
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is a value returned by `func_3()`, `x` is a value returned by `func_3()`, and `a` is a value returned by `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is the maximum count of consecutive 1s found during the loop execution.
    #
    #To explain in natural language: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `n` retains its initial value, `x` retains its initial value, and `a` retains its initial value. The list `t` remains empty as it is reset to an empty list at the end of each inner loop iteration where `a` is modified. The variable `ans` holds the maximum count of consecutive 1s found during the loop execution.
    return max(ans, len(a))
    #The program returns the maximum count of consecutive 1s found during the loop execution, which is either `max(ans, len(a))`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a tuple (n, x) where n is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, and x is an integer less than 2^30. It also accepts a list a of n integers, where each integer in the list is less than 2^30. The function returns the maximum count of consecutive 1s found during the loop execution, which is either the maximum count or the length of the list a.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the maximum count of consecutive 1s found during the loop execution, which is either `max(ans, len(a))`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
