You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding the maximum number \( k \) such that we can partition the array into segments where the cumulative XOR of each segment, when OR'ed together, does not exceed \( x \).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The solution iterates over bits from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB).
   - For each bit position, it checks if the current value of \( x \) at that bit position is zero or one.
   - If the bit in \( x \) is zero, it checks if the cumulative XOR of the array elements at that bit position is even or odd.
   - If the bit in \( x \) is one and the cumulative XOR is odd, it continues.
   - If the bit in \( x \) is one and the cumulative XOR is even, it updates the answer \( k \).
   - If the bit in \( x \) is one and the cumulative XOR is zero, it processes the array to find valid segments.

3. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - The function `func_5` correctly handles the main logic of the problem.
   - It iterates over each bit position from 29 to 0 (since \( x \) is less than \( 2^{30} \)).
   - For each bit position, it checks the corresponding bit in \( x \) and the cumulative XOR of the array elements.
   - It uses a list `t` to store intermediate results and updates the answer \( k \) accordingly.
   - The final result is the maximum \( k \) found, or -1 if no valid segments exist.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where the cumulative XOR is zero or one appropriately.
   - It correctly identifies when to break out of the loop if the cumulative XOR becomes zero.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The function `func_5` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
   - It handles all given test cases correctly, as demonstrated by the provided examples.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
