Reasoning:
1. **Function Analysis**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads and returns a list of integers from the input. This function is correctly implemented and matches the expected behavior.
   - `func_2()`: Reads an integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases. This function is also correctly implemented.
   - `func_3()`: Reads and returns a map object containing integers from the input. However, the actual implementation of `func_3()` in the code is identical to `func_1()`, which is incorrect. It should read and return a tuple `(n, x)` instead.
   - `func_4()`: Reads a line of input and returns it as a string. This function is correctly implemented but is not used in the main logic.
   - `func_5()`: Implements the core logic to solve the problem. It correctly processes the input and calculates the maximum number of segments that satisfy the given conditions.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic in `func_5()` is correctly implemented to find the maximum number of segments `[l_i, r_i]` such that the bitwise OR of the XORs of the subarrays satisfies the condition.
   - The function iterates over the bits from the most significant to the least significant, checking the parity of the bit in `x` and the sum of the corresponding bits in `a`.
   - Based on these values, it updates the counter `ans` to store the maximum count of consecutive 1s found during the loop execution.
   - If certain conditions are met, it modifies the list `a` and resets the counter.
   - Finally, the function returns the maximum count of consecutive 1s found, which is the greater of `ans` and the length of the list `a`.

3. **Issue with `func_3()`**:
   - The function `func_3()` is incorrectly implemented. It should read and return a tuple `(n, x)` instead of a map object. This is a critical issue because the main logic relies on correctly parsing the input `(n, x)`.

Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect due to the incorrect implementation of `func_3()`.

Correctness: **False**
