### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding the maximum number \( k \) such that we can partition the array into segments where the cumulative XOR of each segment, when OR'ed together, does not exceed \( x \).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The solution iterates over bits from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB).
   - For each bit position, it checks if the current value of \( x \) at that bit position is zero or one.
   - If the bit in \( x \) is zero, it checks if the cumulative XOR of the array elements at that bit position is even or odd.
   - If the bit in \( x \) is one and the cumulative XOR is odd, it continues.
   - If the bit in \( x \) is one and the cumulative XOR is even, it updates the answer \( k \).
   - If the bit in \( x \) is one and the cumulative XOR is zero, it processes the array to find valid segments.

3. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - The function `func_5` correctly handles the main logic of the problem.
   - It iterates over each bit position from 29 to 0 (since \( x \) is less than \( 2^{30} \)).
   - For each bit position, it checks the corresponding bit in \( x \) and the cumulative XOR of the array elements.
   - It uses a list `t` to store intermediate results and updates the answer \( k \) accordingly.
   - The final result is the maximum \( k \) found, or -1 if no valid segments exist.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where the cumulative XOR is zero or one appropriately.
   - It correctly identifies when to break out of the loop if the cumulative XOR becomes zero.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The function `func_5` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
   - It handles all given test cases correctly, as demonstrated by the provided examples.
