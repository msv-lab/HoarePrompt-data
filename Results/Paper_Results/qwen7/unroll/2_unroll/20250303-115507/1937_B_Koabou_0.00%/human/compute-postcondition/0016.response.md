Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases internally. For each test case, it accepts a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and two binary strings of length `n` representing the values of `a_{1j}` and `a_{2j}` for 1 ≤ j ≤ n. The function returns a result based on the comparison of these binary strings across all test cases.**

Note: The function processes multiple test cases where each test case includes specific parameters and binary strings, but the function itself does not accept these parameters directly.
