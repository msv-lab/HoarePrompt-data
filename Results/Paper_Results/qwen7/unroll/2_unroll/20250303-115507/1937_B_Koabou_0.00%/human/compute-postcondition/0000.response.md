Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `a`. This operation does not affect the value of `t` or the binary strings mentioned in the initial state description. Therefore, `t` remains a positive integer within the specified range, and the list `a` is initialized as an empty list.
