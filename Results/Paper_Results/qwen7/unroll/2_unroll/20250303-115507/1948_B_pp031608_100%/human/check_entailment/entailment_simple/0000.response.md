Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array from the end to the beginning.
2. It checks if the current element is less than the previous one.
3. If it is, it splits the current element into its digits and checks if the resulting list is sorted.
4. If the list of digits is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
5. Finally, it prints "YES" if `ans` is still `True`, otherwise it prints "NO".

However, there are some issues with the logic:
- The program only checks if the digits of the current element and the previous element form a sorted sequence when the current element is smaller than the previous one. This is insufficient because the problem requires checking if the entire array can be sorted by repeatedly splitting elements.
- The program does not handle the case where the array can be sorted by repeatedly applying the operation to any element, not just the last one.
- The program does not correctly handle the case where the array can be sorted by splitting elements in a way that maintains the non-decreasing order.

Given these issues, the provided solution is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
