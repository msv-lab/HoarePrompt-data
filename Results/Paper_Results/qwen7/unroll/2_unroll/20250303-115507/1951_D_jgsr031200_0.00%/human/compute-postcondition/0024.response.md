Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` (both between 1 and \(10^{18}\)). It checks if `n` equals `k`, in which case it prints "YES" three times and returns `n`. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints "NO" and returns `None`. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates the sum of `n` divided by each value in the list `[n - k + 1, 1]` and stores it in `h`. If `h` is less than `k`, it prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES", "2", and the list `[n - k + 1, 1]`. The function returns `n` if it equals `k` or `None` otherwise.**
