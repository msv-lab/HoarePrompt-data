Output State: **The program returns None**

Given the initial state where `n` and `k` are positive integers with `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}`, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is less than `k`, the provided code snippet does not perform any operation or assignment before returning. Therefore, the return statement without any value specified results in the program returning `None`.
