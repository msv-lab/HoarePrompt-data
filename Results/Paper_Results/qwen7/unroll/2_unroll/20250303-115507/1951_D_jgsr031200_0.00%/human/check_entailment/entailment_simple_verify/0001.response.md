### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to determine if Bob can set up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. Alice buys greedily from each stall in sequence until she runs out of coins or cannot afford any more jewels.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` (coins Alice has) and `k` (jewels Bob wants Alice to buy).
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` is supposed to determine if it's possible to achieve exactly `k` jewels and, if so, output the necessary details.

3. **Function `func_1(n, k)` Analysis**:
   - If `n == k`, it directly prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with a price of 1 coin, which is correct because Alice would buy exactly `k` jewels if the price is 1 coin.
   - If `n < k`, it prints "NO" because Alice doesn't have enough coins to buy even one jewel.
   - Otherwise, it initializes a list `costs` with two values: `n - k + 1` and 1. These values are used to calculate how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall.
     - The first value `n - k + 1` ensures that Alice can buy at least one jewel from the first stall.
     - The second value `1` ensures that Alice can buy at most one jewel from the second stall.
   - It then calculates the total number of jewels Alice can buy (`h`) using these prices.
     - `curr = n // i` calculates the maximum number of jewels Alice can buy from the current stall.
     - `h += curr` adds the number of jewels Alice can buy from the current stall to the total.
     - `n -= i * curr` updates the remaining coins after buying the jewels from the current stall.
   - If `h < k`, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy exactly `k` jewels with the given prices.
   - If `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints "YES" and the number of stalls (2 in this case), and the prices for the stalls.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for handling the special case when `n == k` is correct.
   - The logic for checking if `n < k` is also correct.
   - The calculation of the number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall and the total number of jewels is correct.
   - The output format matches the requirements of the problem.

However, there is a flaw in the logic when `n >= k`. The program assumes that setting up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1` will always allow Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels. This is not necessarily true. For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 5`, the program would set up two stalls with prices `6` and `1`. However, Alice would buy 1 jewel from the first stall (6 coins) and 4 jewels from the second stall (4 coins), resulting in a total of 5 jewels, but the prices are not optimal.

A better approach would be to set up stalls such that the prices form a decreasing sequence, ensuring that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. For instance, if `n = 10` and `k = 5`, the program should set up stalls with prices `2, 2, 2, 2, 2` (or any other combination that sums to `n` and allows Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels).

### Conclusion:
The given program does not always produce the correct solution. While it works for some cases, it fails to handle general cases where the prices need to be optimally set to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
