Reasoning:
1. The provided function `func_1()` does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
2. The current implementation of `func_1()` counts the number of inversions in the binary string where '1' comes before '0'. This approach does not account for the cost of cyclic shifts, which is defined as the length of the substring being shifted.
3. To solve the problem correctly, we need to identify segments of '1's and '0's and calculate the cost of cyclic shifts to move '1's to the front and '0's to the back.
4. The given solution does not consider the length of the substrings being shifted, which is a critical part of calculating the cost.

Given these points, the provided function does not implement the logic required to solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
