Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads a balanced parentheses sequence from the input.
2. It calculates the balance at each position and stores the necessary information in the `details` list.
3. The `details` list is sorted based on the balance values, with ties broken by the negative of the index.
4. After sorting, the function constructs the resulting balanced shuffle by concatenating the characters from the sorted list.
5. Given the problem statement and the provided example, the function should produce the correct balanced shuffle.

Given the logic and steps outlined in the annotated program, the function appears to correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
