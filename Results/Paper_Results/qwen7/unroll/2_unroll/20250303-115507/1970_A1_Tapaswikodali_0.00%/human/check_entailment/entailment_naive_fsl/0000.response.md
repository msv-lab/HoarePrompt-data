Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation. Specifically, the sorting step is flawed because it uses `-i` to break ties in decreasing order of position. This approach does not ensure that the positions are sorted in decreasing order as required. Instead, it sorts in increasing order of the original position indices.

For example, consider the input `(()(()))`. The correct balanced shuffle should be `()(()())`, but the program will produce `(()()())` due to the incorrect sorting logic. Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.
