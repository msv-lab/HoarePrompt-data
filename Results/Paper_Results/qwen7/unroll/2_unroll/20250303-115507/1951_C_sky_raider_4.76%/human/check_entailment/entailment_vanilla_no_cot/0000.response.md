Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost**: The formula `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2` is incorrect. The cost should be `l[i] * s`, but the term `- s * s / 2` is unnecessary and incorrect.

2. **Sorting the List**: Sorting the list `l` before processing is not necessary and can be omitted since the algorithm needs to process the days in order.

3. **Calculation of Minimum Spending**: The logic for calculating the minimum spending is flawed. The variable `s` is set to `min(m, k)` and then subtracted from `k`, but this does not correctly account for the cumulative effect of purchasing tickets on subsequent days.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initialize variables
        total_cost = 0
        remaining_tickets = k
        
        for i in range(n):
            # Determine how many tickets can be bought today without exceeding the limit
            tickets_to_buy_today = min(m, remaining_tickets)
            remaining_tickets -= tickets_to_buy_today
            
            # Calculate the cost for today's tickets
            total_cost += tickets_to_buy_today * a[i]
            
            # Update the price per ticket for the remaining days
            if tickets_to_buy_today > 0:
                for j in range(i + 1, n):
                    a[j] += tickets_to_buy_today
        
        print(total_cost)


# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the cost is calculated correctly and accounts for the cumulative effect of purchasing tickets on subsequent days.
