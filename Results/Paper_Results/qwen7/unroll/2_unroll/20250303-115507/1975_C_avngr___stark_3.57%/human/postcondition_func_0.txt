The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and an array a consisting of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It then finds the maximum value among the minimum pairs of adjacent elements in the array a and prints this value. After processing all test cases, it outputs the final maximum value found.
