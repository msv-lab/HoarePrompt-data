Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1**.

Explanation: The code initializes two variables `l` and `r`. `l` is assigned the value 0, and `r` is assigned the value `n - 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the list `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
