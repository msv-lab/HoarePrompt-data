Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine which letter (either 'A' or 'B') appears most frequently in a given string of length 5. The program iterates through each character of the input string, counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', and then prints the more frequent character. This logic is consistent with the problem description and works for all given test cases.
