You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each test case, the input string is a string of length 5 consisting of characters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings across all test cases are distinct.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state consists of `t` lines, each line containing either 'A' or 'B'. For each input string `s` of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B', if the number of 'A's is greater than the number of 'B's, the corresponding line contains 'A'; otherwise, it contains 'B'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Character Counting**: For each test case, the program initializes counters `ac` and `bc` to count the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', respectively.
3. **String Iteration**: It iterates through each character in the string and increments the appropriate counter based on whether the character is 'A' or 'B'.
4. **Comparison and Output**: After counting the characters, it compares the counts of 'A' and 'B'. If 'A' is more frequent, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'.
5. **Edge Cases**: Since the problem specifies that the input strings are of length 5 and consist only of 'A' and 'B', the logic should handle all possible combinations correctly.
6. **Output Format**: The program outputs the result in the required format, with one letter per line for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to be correct and will produce the expected output for the given examples.

### Correctness:
**True**
