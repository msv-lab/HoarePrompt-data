Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates through each test case, reading a string of length 5.
3. For each character in the string, it counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'.
4. After counting, it compares the counts and prints the more frequent character.
5. Given the constraints and the example provided, the logic seems to handle all cases correctly, including edge cases where the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal (though the problem statement specifies distinct strings, so this should not occur).

Given the above analysis, the program logic matches the problem requirements and handles all provided test cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
