The function accepts a list `odds` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `a` of length `n` that is symmetric around its center. Each element in `a` is either 0 or half the difference between consecutive elements in the `odds` list, depending on the position and whether the index is at the center or not. If the index is at the center, the corresponding element in `a` is set to the current element of `odds`.
