Output State: `idx` is -1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of length `n` where each element is either 0 or half the difference between consecutive elements in `odds` list (if `idx` is not at the center), `prev` is the last element of `odds`. The list `a` is symmetric around its center if `n` is odd, and `a[idx]` is set to the current element of `odds` when `idx` is at the center.
