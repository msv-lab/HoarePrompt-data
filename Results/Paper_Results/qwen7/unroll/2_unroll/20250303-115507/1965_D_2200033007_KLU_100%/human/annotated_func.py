#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `a`, which represents the subarray sums of a palindrome array. It calculates all possible subarray sums of `a`, starting from each index to the end of the list, stores these sums in a new list `cts`, sorts this list, and then returns the sorted list.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `cts`, which represents all but one of the distinct subarray sums of a palindrome array `a`. It processes this list by iterating through its elements and constructs a new list `odds` that excludes any element found to be identical to the last element added to `odds`. The function then returns this list `odds`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `odds` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `a` of length `n` that is symmetric around its center. Each element in `a` is either 0 or half the difference between consecutive elements in the `odds` list, depending on the position and whether the index is at the center or not.
