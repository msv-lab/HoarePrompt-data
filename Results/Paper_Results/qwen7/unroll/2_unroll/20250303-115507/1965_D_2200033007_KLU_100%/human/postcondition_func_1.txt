The function accepts a list of integers `cts`, which represents all but one of the distinct subarray sums of a palindrome array `a`. It processes this list by iterating through its elements and constructs a new list `odds` that excludes any element found to be identical to the last element added to `odds`. The function then returns this list `odds`.
