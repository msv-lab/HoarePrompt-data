#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 5, and a is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = input()
        
        ans = 0
        
        p = 'ABCDEF'
        
        hmp = Counter(s)
        
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
        
        for i in hmp:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. For each iteration of the loop, n and m are integers, s is a string consisting of characters from 'A' to 'F', hmp is a dictionary counting occurrences of each character in s, p is the string 'ABCDEF', and ans is an integer calculated based on the counts of characters in s compared to m. After all iterations, t remains the same, but ans is the sum of m for each character in p not present in s, plus the difference (m - count) for each character in s that has a count less than m.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ m ≤ 5), and a string s of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'. For each test case, it calculates and prints the value of ans, which is the sum of m for each character in the string 'ABCDEF' not present in s, plus the difference (m - count) for each character in s that has a count less than m. The final state of the program includes the original value of t unchanged, and the printed value of ans for each test case.
