You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 5, and a is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.

        print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. For each iteration of the loop, n and m are integers, s is a string consisting of characters from 'A' to 'F', hmp is a dictionary counting occurrences of each character in s, p is the string 'ABCDEF', and ans is an integer calculated based on the counts of characters in s compared to m. After all iterations, t remains the same, but ans is the sum of m for each character in p not present in s, plus the difference (m - count) for each character in s that has a count less than m.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create. Specifically, the program fails to handle the case where the required number of problems of a certain difficulty level is less than `m` but the current count is greater than zero. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
10 1
BBCDEFFGG
```

In this case, the input string `s` is `BBCDEFFGG`, which means there are already 2 problems of difficulty 'B', 2 problems of difficulty 'C', 2 problems of difficulty 'D', 2 problems of difficulty 'F', and 2 problems of difficulty 'G'. However, there are no problems of difficulty 'A' and 'E'. According to the problem description, Vlad needs to create 2 problems (one of difficulty 'A' and one of difficulty 'E') to meet the requirement of holding 1 round. 

However, the program calculates the number of additional problems needed as follows:
- For 'A': It checks if 'A' is not in `hmp` and adds `m` (which is 1), resulting in `ans += 1`.
- For 'E': It checks if the count of 'E' is less than `m` (which is 1), and since the count is 0, it adds `m - 0` (which is 1), resulting in `ans += 1`.

Thus, the program incorrectly outputs `2` instead of `2` (correctly identifying the need for 2 problems).

To fix this, the program should ensure that for each required difficulty level, it only adds the difference between `m` and the current count if the current count is less than `m`.
