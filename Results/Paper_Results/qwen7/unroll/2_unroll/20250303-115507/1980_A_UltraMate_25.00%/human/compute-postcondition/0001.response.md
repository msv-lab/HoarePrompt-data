State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, _ is a dummy variable initialized to 0**.

Explanation:
- The loop head contains two objects: `_` (a dummy variable) and `t` (the number of iterations).
- The value of `_` is irrelevant as it is a dummy variable used for iteration.
- The value of `t` determines whether the loop can execute. Since `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, it must be an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is within the specified range.
