Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. `a` is a list of `k` integers where 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k ≤ 100. `b` is a list of `q` integers where 1 ≤ n_i ≤ 100 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ q. Depending on the conditions, the function either returns a new list where each element from the original list `a` is decremented by 1, or it returns the list `b` as is.**
