Output State: **The program returns a list containing each element of the original list a minus 1.**

This means that for each integer in the list `a`, the program subtracts 1 from it and returns a new list with these adjusted values. Since the initial state defines `a` as a list of integers where each subsequent integer is greater than the previous one, the returned list will contain each of those integers decremented by 1.
