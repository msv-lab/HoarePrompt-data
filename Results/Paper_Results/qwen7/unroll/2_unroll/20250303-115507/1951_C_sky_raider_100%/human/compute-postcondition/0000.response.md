Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration of the loop. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than the value returned by `int(input())`.

3. **Determine the Value of `int(input())`**: The value of `int(input())` is determined by the user input, but based on the given constraints, `t` (which is the value of `int(input())`) is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

4. **Adjust the State**: To ensure the loop can execute at least once, `i` must be less than `t`. Since `i` starts from 0, the condition `i < t` must hold true.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is 0 and `t` (the value of `int(input())`) is greater than 0 and within the specified range.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4**
