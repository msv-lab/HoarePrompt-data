Output State: t is an integer initialized to 0; n, m, and k are integers read from input; l is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order; s and c are integers initialized to 0; after executing the loop, c is the sum of the products of each element in l with t plus the minimum of m and k, and t plus the minimum of m and k, respectively, for each iteration.
