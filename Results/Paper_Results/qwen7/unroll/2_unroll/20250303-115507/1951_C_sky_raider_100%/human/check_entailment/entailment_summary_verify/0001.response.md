### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The function correctly parses the input values `n`, `m`, and `k` for each test case, and the list of ticket prices `l`.

2. **Sorting**: The ticket prices list `l` is sorted in ascending order. This is a key point because it allows the algorithm to consider the cheapest prices first, which is essential for minimizing the total cost.

3. **Initialization**: The variables `t`, `s`, and `c` are initialized to 0. `t` keeps track of the cumulative effect of previous purchases, `s` represents the number of tickets to be purchased on the current day, and `c` accumulates the total cost.

4. **Loop Through Days**: The loop iterates through each day. For each day:
   - `s` is set to the minimum of `m` and `k`. This ensures that no more than `m` tickets can be purchased on any single day.
   - The cost for purchasing `s` tickets on the current day is calculated as `s * (l[i] + t)`, where `l[i]` is the price of a ticket on the current day and `t` is the cumulative effect of previous purchases.
   - The total cost `c` is updated by adding the cost of the tickets purchased on the current day.
   - The cumulative effect `t` is updated by adding the number of tickets purchased on the current day (`s`).
   - The number of tickets left to be purchased `k` is reduced by `s`.

5. **Output**: The total cost `c` is printed after processing all test cases.

However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of the function. The issue lies in how the cumulative effect `t` is being used in the calculation of the cost for purchasing tickets on each day. Specifically, the formula `s * (l[i] + t)` incorrectly accounts for the cumulative effect of previous purchases. The cumulative effect `t` should only be applied to the price of the tickets purchased on the same day, not to the price of the tickets purchased on subsequent days. 

To illustrate, let's consider the example provided in the problem description:

- Input: `n = 4`, `m = 2`, `k = 3`, `a = [8, 6, 4, 2]`
- Sorting `a` gives `[2, 4, 6, 8]`

If we follow the logic of the given function:
1. On the first day, we can buy 2 tickets at a cost of `2 * (2 + 0) = 4`.
2. On the second day, we can buy 2 tickets at a cost of `2 * (4 + 2) = 12`.
3. On the third day, we can buy 1 ticket at a cost of `1 * (6 + 4) = 10`.

The total cost would be `4 + 12 + 10 = 26`, which is incorrect according to the example solution.

The correct approach should be to calculate the cost for each day independently without carrying the cumulative effect forward. Here is the corrected logic:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        t = 0
        c = 0
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            c += s * (l[i] + t)
            t += s
            k -= s
        print(int(c))
```

This corrected version ensures that the cumulative effect `t` is only applied to the current day's purchase and not carried forward to subsequent days.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was incorrect because the function incorrectly applies the cumulative effect `t` to the cost calculation for each day. The provided function does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
