### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The function correctly parses the input values `n`, `m`, and `k` for each test case, and the list of ticket prices `l`.

2. **Sorting**: The ticket prices list `l` is sorted in ascending order. This is a key point because it allows the algorithm to consider the cheapest prices first, which is essential for minimizing the total cost.

3. **Initialization**: The variables `t`, `s`, and `c` are initialized to 0. `t` keeps track of the cumulative effect of previous purchases, `s` represents the number of tickets to be purchased on the current day, and `c` accumulates the total cost.

4. **Loop Through Days**: The loop iterates through each day. For each day:
   - `s` is set to the minimum of `m` and `k`. This ensures that no more than `m` tickets can be purchased on any single day.
   - The cost for purchasing `s` tickets on the current day is calculated as `s * (l[i] + t)`, where `l[i]` is the price of a ticket on the current day and `t` is the cumulative effect of previous purchases.
   - The total cost `c` is updated by adding the cost of the tickets purchased on the current day.
   - The cumulative effect `t` is updated by adding the number of tickets purchased on the current day (`s`).
   - The number of tickets left to be purchased `k` is reduced by `s`.

5. **Output**: The total cost `c` is printed after processing all test cases.

6. **Test Cases**: The provided examples and the function's behavior match the problem statement. The function correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, such as when `k` is less than `m` or when the number of days is limited.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the logic, there is a critical flaw in the implementation. Specifically, the calculation of the cost for purchasing `s` tickets on the current day should not include the cumulative effect `t` if the tickets are purchased on the same day. Instead, the cumulative effect `t` should only apply to future days after the current day's purchase.

### Corrected Logic:
- When purchasing `s` tickets on day `i`, the cost should be `s * l[i]`.
- The cumulative effect `t` should only start applying to future days after the current day's purchase.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        t = 0
        c = 0
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            c += s * l[i]
            t += s
            k -= s
        print(int(c))
```

### Explanation:
- The corrected logic ensures that the cost for purchasing tickets on the current day does not include the cumulative effect `t`.
- The cumulative effect `t` only starts applying to future days after the current day's purchase.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly assumed that the cumulative effect `t` should be included in the cost calculation for the current day. The corrected logic ensures that the cumulative effect only applies to future days, which is necessary to minimize the total cost.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in the cost calculation.
