You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program:
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
        cases.append((n, s))
    return cases

#Function 2:
def func_2(case):
    ups = sum((1 for c in case[1] if c == 'U'))
    return 'YES' if ups % 2 else 'NO'



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts a list `case` containing two elements: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of "U" and "D". It counts the number of "U" characters in the string `s`. If the count of "U" is odd, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` from standard input.
   - It then iterates `t` times to read the number of coins `n` and the string `s` for each test case.
   - It stores each test case as a tuple `(n, s)` in a list called `cases`.
   - The function correctly handles the reading of input and storing it in a structured format.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes a single test case as an argument.
   - It counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s` using a generator expression within the `sum` function.
   - It returns 'YES' if the count of 'U' is odd, otherwise it returns 'NO'.
   - This logic aligns with the problem statement where the player with an odd number of facing-up coins wins.

3. **Overall Logic**:
   - The main program calls `func_1` to get all test cases.
   - It then calls `func_2` for each test case and prints the result.
   - The logic in `func_2` is correct and matches the problem's requirements.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where `n` is 1 or 2, as specified in the problem statement.
   - The program correctly outputs "YES" or "NO" based on whether the number of facing-up coins is odd or even.

### Conclusion:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
