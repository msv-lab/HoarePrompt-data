Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the initial configuration of coins.
- The game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of coins facing up ("U").
- `func_1` correctly reads the input and constructs a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the number of coins and their initial configuration.
- `func_2` calculates the number of coins facing up and determines the winner based on whether this count is odd or even. If the count is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
- Given the problem statement and the provided examples, the logic in `func_2` accurately reflects the rules of the game.
- There are no logical errors or inconsistencies between the problem description and the implementation of the functions.

Correctness: **True**
