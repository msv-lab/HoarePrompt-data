Output State: **The program returns a list named 'cases' containing 't' tuples. Each tuple contains an integer 'n' (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string 's' of length 'n' consisting of only "U" and "D".**

This means the program returns the original list `cases` which was initially defined as a list containing `t` tuples, each tuple consisting of an integer `n` between 1 and 100, inclusive, and a string `s` of length `n` made up solely of the characters "U" and "D".
