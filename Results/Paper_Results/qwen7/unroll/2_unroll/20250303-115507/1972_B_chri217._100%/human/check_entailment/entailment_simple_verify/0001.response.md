### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case to form a list of tuples `(n, s)`. Each tuple contains the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the initial state of the coins.
   - The function correctly handles the input reading and storage in a structured format.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s` and determines the winner based on whether this count is odd or even.
   - However, the logic in `func_2` does not fully capture the complexity of the game. The problem description specifies that players remove facing-up coins and flip their adjacent coins. The count of 'U' in the initial string does not directly determine the winner because the game involves strategic removal and flipping of coins.

3. **Game Dynamics**:
   - The game involves a series of moves where players strategically remove facing-up coins and flip their adjacent coins. The outcome depends on the sequence of moves and the parity of the number of coins remaining after each move.
   - The current implementation in `func_2` only checks the initial count of 'U' and does not simulate the game's dynamics. This means it cannot accurately predict the winner based on the given rules.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does handle the edge cases where `n` is 1 or 2, but these cases are not sufficient to validate the overall correctness of the program.
   - For larger values of `n`, the program's logic fails to account for the strategic nature of the game.

### Conclusion:
The provided Python program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules and constraints. The function `func_2` incorrectly assumes that the count of 'U' in the initial string determines the winner, which is not true due to the game's dynamic nature.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
