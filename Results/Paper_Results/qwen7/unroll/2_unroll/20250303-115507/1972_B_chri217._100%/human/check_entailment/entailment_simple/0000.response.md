Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input as specified in the problem statement.
2. `func_1()` correctly processes the input and returns a list of tuples, each containing the number of coins and the initial state of the coins.
3. `func_2()` calculates the number of coins facing up (`ups`). If this number is odd, it returns "YES" indicating Alice wins; otherwise, it returns "NO" indicating Bob wins.
4. The logic in `func_2()` is correct according to the rules of the game. The key observation is that the game's outcome depends on whether the number of coins facing up is odd or even. If the number of coins facing up is odd, Alice can always force a win by making optimal moves. If it is even, Bob can always force a win.
5. The program iterates over each test case and prints the result for each case as required.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the initial configuration of the coins.

Correctness: **True**
