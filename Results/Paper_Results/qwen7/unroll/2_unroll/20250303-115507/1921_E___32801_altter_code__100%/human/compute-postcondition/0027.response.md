Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers [n, m, x1 + 1, y, x2, y2], `b` is the value of x2 - x1, where x2 is greater than x1, the difference (x2 - x1) is odd, and y is y2 - 1. Additionally, y1 is not equal to y2.**

Explanation: The code `b = x2 - x1` calculates the difference between `x2` and `x1` and assigns it to `b`. Since `x2` is greater than `x1` and their difference is odd, `b` will be an odd number. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
