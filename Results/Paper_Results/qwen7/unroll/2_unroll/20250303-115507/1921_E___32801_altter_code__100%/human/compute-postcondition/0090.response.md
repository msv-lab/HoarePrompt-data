Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `r` is a list containing six integers \([n, m, x1 + a, y1, x2 - a, y2]\). Here, `y2` is adjusted according to the conditions: if `y1 <= y2`, then `y2` is set to `y2 - a`; otherwise, `y2` is set to `y2 + a`.
- `b` is the difference between `x2 - a` and `x1`, i.e., \(b = (x2 - a) - x1\).
- `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, i.e., \(t = |y2 - y1|\).
- `x2` is greater than or equal to `x1`.
- `x1` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.
- The condition \((b // 2 > a \text{ and } \text{abs}(x2 - c) \geq x1 + c \text{ and } (1 \leq y1 \leq m) \text{ and } (1 \leq x1 \leq n))\) is true.

Given this information, the `print` statement simply outputs the string "bob".

Output: **bob**
