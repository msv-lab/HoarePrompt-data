Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers [n, m, x1 + 1, y, x2, y2], `a` is m - y2, where n, m, x1, y1, x2, and y2 are the integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, x2 is greater than x1, the difference (x2 - x1) is odd, and y is y2 - 1. Additionally, y1 is not equal to y2, and y1 is less than y2.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value `m - y2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The conditions and relationships between the variables `n`, `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, and `y` also remain valid.
