Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, r is a list containing six integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `r = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `r`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, so it is still a positive integer within the specified range.
