Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, r is a list containing six integers [n, m, x1 + 1, y, x2, y2], a is y2 - 1, x2 is greater than x1, the difference (x2 - x1) is odd, and y is y2 - 1. Additionally, y1 is not equal to y2, and the current value of y1 is greater than or equal to y2.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value `y2 - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The conditions involving `x1`, `x2`, `y`, and the relationship between `y1` and `y2` are still valid.
