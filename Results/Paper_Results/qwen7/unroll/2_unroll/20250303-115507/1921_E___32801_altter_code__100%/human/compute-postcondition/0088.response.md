Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers [n, m, x1 + a, y1, x2 - a, y2]. Depending on whether `y1` is less than or equal to `y2`, `y2` is adjusted as follows: if `y1` <= `y2`, then `y2` is set to `y2 - a`; otherwise, `y2` is set to `y2 + a`. `b` is the difference between `x2 - a` and `x1`, `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `x2` is greater than or equal to `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, and the condition `(b // 2 > a and abs(x2 - c) >= x1 + c and (1 <= y1 <= m) and (1 <= x1 <= n))` is true.
