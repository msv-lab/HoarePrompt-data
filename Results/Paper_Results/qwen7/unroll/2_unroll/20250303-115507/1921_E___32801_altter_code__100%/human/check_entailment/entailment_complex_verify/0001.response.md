### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the input using `list(map(int, input().split()))` which converts the input into a list of integers. This is necessary for further processing.

2. **Initial Conditions Check**:
   - The program checks if `x2 <= x1`. If true, it prints "draw" immediately. This is correct because if Bob is on or above Alice, Alice cannot win since she can only move down or diagonally down.

3. **Odd Difference Check**:
   - If `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`, the program proceeds to check if `y1 == y2`. If true, it prints "Alice". This is correct because if Alice and Bob are on the same column, Alice can always move down to the same row as Bob and win.
   - If `y1 != y2`, the program attempts to move Alice closer to Bob. However, the logic to adjust `y1` and `x1` does not account for all possible moves and outcomes correctly. Specifically, the logic to adjust `y1` and `x1` is overly complex and does not fully cover all scenarios. For example, it does not handle cases where Alice might be forced into a position where she cannot win.

4. **Even Difference Check**:
   - If `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`, the program again checks if `y1 == y2`. If true, it prints "Bob". This is correct because if Alice and Bob are on the same column, Bob can always move up to the same row as Alice and win.
   - If `y1 != y2`, the program attempts to move Alice and Bob closer to each other. Again, the logic to adjust `y1`, `y2`, and `x1`, `x2` does not cover all scenarios correctly. For example, it does not handle cases where Bob might be forced into a position where he cannot win.

5. **Final Outcome Determination**:
   - The program uses a series of conditions to determine if Alice or Bob can force a win. However, the logic used to determine these conditions is overly complex and does not fully account for all possible game states. For example, it does not handle all edge cases where Alice or Bob might be forced into a position where they cannot win.

Upon closer inspection, the program does not fully implement the optimal strategy for determining the game outcome. There are several logical errors and the conditions are not fully covered. For instance, the logic to adjust the coordinates and determine the winner is overly complex and does not handle all possible game states correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program contains several logical errors and does not fully implement the optimal strategy for determining the game outcome. Therefore, it is not correct.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
