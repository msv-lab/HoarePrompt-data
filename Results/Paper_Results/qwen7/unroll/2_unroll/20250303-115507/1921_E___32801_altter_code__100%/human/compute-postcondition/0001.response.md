Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, r is a list containing six integers [n, m, x1, y1, x2, y2], where n, m, x1, y1, x2, and y2 are the integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code unpacks the list `r` into six variables: `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the assignment operation. The list `r` now contains these six integers.
