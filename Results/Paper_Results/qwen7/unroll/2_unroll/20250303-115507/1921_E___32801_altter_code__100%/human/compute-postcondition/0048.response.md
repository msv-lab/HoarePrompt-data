Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers [n, m, x1 + a, y, x2 - a, y2], `b` is the value of (x2 - a) - x1, and the difference ((x2 - a) - x1) is even. `y` is either y2 - 1 or 0, depending on whether y2 is less than or equal to y1 or not. If y2 <= y1, then y is 0 and `t` is equal to the absolute value of 1 - y1. If y2 > y1, then y is y2 - 1 and `t` is equal to the absolute value of y2 - y1. `c` is either y1 - 1 or m - y1, depending on the same condition as above. The condition (x2 > x1 and x1 ≥ 1 and x2 ≤ n) holds.
