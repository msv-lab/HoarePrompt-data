Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers [n, m, x1 + 1, y, x2, y2], `b` is the value of x2 - x1, where x2 is greater than x1, the difference (x2 - x1) is odd, and y is y2 - 1; `t` is now equal to the absolute value of y2 - y1.**

This means that the value of `t` has been updated to the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
