nodes is a list of integers representing the number of nodes in the tree, start is an integer representing the starting node for each round, and parent is an optional integer representing the parent node used in the depth-first search traversal. Additionally, t is fixed to 1, and the input constraints are 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5 for the number of nodes and 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n for the edges of the tree.
