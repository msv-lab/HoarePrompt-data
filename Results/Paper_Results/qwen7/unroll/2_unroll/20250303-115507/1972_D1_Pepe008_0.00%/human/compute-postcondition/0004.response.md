Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6) are processed. The function returns a result based on the conditions given for n and m, without explicitly defining what those results are in the provided snippet.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value for t, followed by values for n and m. For each set of n and m, the function will determine some outcome based on the specified constraints, but the exact nature of the return value is not detailed in the given information.
