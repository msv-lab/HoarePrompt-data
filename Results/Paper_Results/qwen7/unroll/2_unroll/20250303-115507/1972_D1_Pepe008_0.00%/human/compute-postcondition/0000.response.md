Output State: **`T` is an input integer, and it is within the range 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The code `T = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `T`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, the same condition applies to `T` after the code is executed. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged, so the only updated information is the value of `T`.
