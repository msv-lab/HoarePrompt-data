State: **`T` must be greater than 0 and `t` must be 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for t in range(T):` will start executing if and only if `T` is a positive integer.
2. The variable `t` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
3. The initial value of `t` (which is 0) is correct because `range(T)` starts counting from 0 up to `T-1`.
4. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `T` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop can execute, and `t` must be 0 as it is the starting point of the loop.

Thus, the final state is: **`T` must be greater than 0 and `t` must be 0**.
