Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Inner Loop Range**: The inner loop should iterate over `b` and check the condition for each pair `(i, j)` where `1 ≤ i ≤ n` and `1 ≤ j ≤ m`. However, the current implementation uses `range(1, a+1)` for `i` and `range(4, b+1)` for `j`, which is not correct.

2. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The condition `if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0:` is commented out, and the program directly calculates `suma` using an incorrect formula. This formula does not correctly count the number of valid pairs.

3. **Formula Used**: The formula `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` is incorrect and does not satisfy the required condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `a` or `b` is small, and the logic might fail to count valid pairs accurately.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the given ranges and check the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

This version correctly iterates over all pairs `(a, b)` and checks the condition, ensuring the solution is accurate.
