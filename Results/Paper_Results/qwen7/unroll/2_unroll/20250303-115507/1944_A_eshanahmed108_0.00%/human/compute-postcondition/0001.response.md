Output State: The output state will consist of a series of numbers printed based on the condition `n if n - k <= 1 else 1` for each test case. For each test case, if `n - k` is less than or equal to 1, the number `n` will be printed; otherwise, the number `1` will be printed. The number of test cases is determined by the first input, which is an integer. Each subsequent line will contain two integers `n` and `k` for the respective test case.
