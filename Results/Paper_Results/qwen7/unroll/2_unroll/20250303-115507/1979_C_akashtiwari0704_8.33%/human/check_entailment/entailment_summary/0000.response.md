Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to distribute coins among different outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. This means we need to find a distribution of bets \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) such that \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i\) for all \(i\).

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`).
   - Each multiplier is then modified to `prod // a[i]`, which represents the amount to bet on the \(i\)-th outcome to ensure the condition is met if the \(i\)-th outcome wins.
   - The sum of these modified amounts is calculated and compared to the original product.
   - If the sum is greater than or equal to the product, it prints `-1`, indicating no suitable distribution exists.
   - Otherwise, it prints the modified amounts as a space-separated string.

3. **Verification**:
   - The logic for calculating the modified amounts is correct. For each \(i\), the amount to bet \(x_i\) should be such that \(x_i < k_i \cdot x_i\). This is achieved by setting \(x_i = \frac{\text{prod}}{k_i}\).
   - The check `if sumo >= prod:` ensures that the total bet is less than the total win for any outcome, which is the required condition.
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, including the number of test cases and the size of the input arrays.

Based on the above analysis, the given program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
