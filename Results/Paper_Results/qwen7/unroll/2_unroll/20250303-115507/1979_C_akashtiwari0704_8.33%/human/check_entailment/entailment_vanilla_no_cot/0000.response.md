Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Bets**: The current logic calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`) and then divides it by each multiplier to determine the bet amounts. This approach doesn't guarantee that the total bet amount will be strictly less than the winnings for any outcome. 

2. **Logic Flaw**: The code checks if `sumo` (total bet amount) is greater than or equal to `prod` (product of all multipliers). However, this check alone is insufficient to ensure that the total bet amount is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome.

3. **Solution Existence Check**: The problem requires finding a distribution where the total bet amount is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome. The current logic does not properly handle cases where such a distribution is impossible.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this correctly, we need to find a way to distribute the bets such that the total bet amount is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome. One effective method is to use a binary search or a greedy approach to find such a distribution.

Hereâ€™s a revised version of the function that attempts to solve the problem correctly:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        bets = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        # Calculate the total multiplier
        total_multiplier = sum(a)
        
        # Try to find a valid distribution
        found = False
        for x in range(1, 10**10 + 1):  # Arbitrarily large upper limit
            if sum(x * (a[i] - 1) for i in range(bets)) < total_multiplier:
                found = True
                break
        
        if not found:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ans = [x * (a[i] - 1) for i in range(bets)]
            print(' '.join(map(str, ans)))

func()
```

This approach tries to find a value `x` such that the total bet amount is strictly less than the total multiplier. If such an `x` is found, it prints the corresponding bet amounts; otherwise, it prints `-1`.
