Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly handles the input format, including the number of test cases, the number of participants (`n`), the number of screenshots (`m`), and the content of each screenshot.

2. **Single Screenshot Case**: The function correctly handles the case where only one screenshot is provided by checking if the order matches the expected order for each participant. This is done by comparing the second screenshot with the first one and ensuring they match except for the author's position.

3. **Multiple Screenshots Case**: The function correctly handles the case where multiple screenshots are provided. It ensures that the positions of the authors in subsequent screenshots match the expected order. If the positions do not match, it prints 'no'.

4. **Order Validation**: The function validates the order of participants in each screenshot against the derived order. It uses a list to store the remaining participants and checks if the current screenshot matches the expected order after inserting the author's position.

5. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as when the positions of authors do not match in the initial comparison and correctly determines the order by inserting the author's position in the appropriate place.

6. **Output**: The function prints 'yes' if a valid order can be derived from all screenshots, and 'no' otherwise. This is consistent with the problem statement.

Given the above points, the function correctly implements the logic required to determine if there is a consistent order of participants that all screenshots correspond to.

Correctness: **True**
