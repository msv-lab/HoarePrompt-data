### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case separately. It correctly handles the input format for each test case, including `n`, `m`, and the subsequent `m` screenshots.

2. **Single Screenshot Case**: When `m == 1`, the program prints 'yes' without further checks, which is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Multiple Screenshots Comparison**:
   - The program compares the first two screenshots (`l1` and `l2`) to check if they share the same elements excluding the author of the screenshot. If they do not match, it prints 'no' and moves to the next test case.
   - If the first two screenshots match, it proceeds to compare subsequent screenshots with the initial comparison result.

4. **Index Matching**:
   - The program attempts to find indices where the elements differ between the first two screenshots. This step is crucial for determining the correct order.
   - If the indices match, it inserts the author of the screenshot into the appropriate position to maintain consistency.

5. **Validation of Subsequent Screenshots**:
   - After processing the initial comparisons, the program validates the remaining screenshots against the constructed list (`l`). If any screenshot does not match, it prints 'no'.
   - If all screenshots match, it prints 'yes'.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the indices might not be found initially, and it correctly handles the insertion logic to maintain the order.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where multiple screenshots need to be validated.

Given the above analysis, the program logic appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem statement. There are no logical errors or missing steps that would cause incorrect outputs.

### Correctness:
