Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two lists of integers and additional integers. For each test case, it checks if certain conditions are met and modifies the lists accordingly. If a valid modified list can be formed, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function does not return any explicit value but prints the result for each test case.**
