### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to check if there exists an order of participants such that all given screenshots can be obtained from this order.
   - Each participant sees themselves at the top of the list, so the order of participants for each user is a shifted version of the actual order.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If `m == 1`, we can directly print "yes" because a single screenshot doesn't contradict any other possible order.
   - For `m > 1`, we need to ensure that the common elements between the first two screenshots match the positions they would have in the actual order.

3. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
   - If `m == 1`, it prints "yes" and continues.
   - It then processes the first two screenshots to find the common elements and their positions.
   - If the common elements do not match the expected positions, it prints "no".
   - If the common elements match, it further checks subsequent screenshots to ensure consistency.

4. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Step 1:** Read the first two screenshots and identify the common elements and their positions.
   - **Step 2:** If the common elements do not match the expected positions, print "no".
   - **Step 3:** If the common elements match, insert the non-common elements into the appropriate positions to form a consistent order.
   - **Step 4:** Check the remaining screenshots to ensure they are consistent with the formed order.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases where `m == 2` and checks the third screenshot only if necessary.
   - The code ensures that the order remains consistent throughout the process.

6. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic correctly identifies if there is a consistent order for the given screenshots.
   - The implementation handles all given constraints and examples provided.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if there is a consistent order for the given screenshots. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
