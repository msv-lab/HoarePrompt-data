Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Querying the Smallest Valid `r` for `f(1, r) = i * n`**:
   - The program starts by querying the smallest valid `r` for `f(1, r) = i * n` for decreasing values of `i` starting from `n`.
   - This is done using the loop `for i in range(n, 0, -1):`.
   - For each `i`, it prints `? 1 {i * n}` and reads the response `v`.
   - If `v` equals `n`, it breaks the loop and sets `v` to `i`.

3. **Checking for Valid Subarray Splitting**:
   - The program then tries to split the array into `k` subarrays where each subarray has the same value `m`.
   - It initializes `cnt` to `k` and `l` to `1`.
   - It enters a while loop that continues until `cnt` is zero or `l` exceeds `n`.
   - For each `l`, it prints `? {l} {i * v}` and reads the response `l`.
   - If `l` becomes `n + 1`, it means no valid subarray can be formed, and the program prints `! -1` and returns.
   - If `cnt` becomes zero and `l` does not exceed `n`, it prints `! {i * v}` and returns.

### Correctness Check

1. **Querying the Smallest Valid `r`**:
   - The logic to find the smallest valid `r` for `f(1, r) = i * n` seems correct. It iterates from `n` down to `1` and finds the first valid `r`.

2. **Splitting the Array into `k` Subarrays**:
   - The logic to check if the array can be split into `k` subarrays with the same product `m` is also correct. It iterates through possible starting points and checks if the conditions are met.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where no valid subarray can be found by checking if `l` exceeds `n` and setting `cnt` to zero.

### Conclusion

The given program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It queries the necessary values and checks the conditions accurately.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
