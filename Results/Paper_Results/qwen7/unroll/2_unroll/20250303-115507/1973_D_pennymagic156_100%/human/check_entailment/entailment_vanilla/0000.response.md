### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to determine the largest value \( m \) such that the array can be split into \( k \) subarrays where each subarray's product of its length and its maximum equals \( m \). If no such \( m \) exists, the answer should be \(-1\).

2. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads and returns a list of integers from the input.
   - `func_2()`: Reads and returns an integer from the input.
   - `func_3()`: Reads and returns a map of integers from the input.
   - `func_4()`: Reads and returns a string from the input.

3. **Function 5 (`func_5()`)**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes `v` to 1 and iterates backward through the possible values from \( n \) to 1.
   - **Querying for Maximum Value**:
     - For each value \( i \) from \( n \) to 1, it queries the smallest \( r \) such that \( f(1, r) = i \times n \).
     - If the returned value is \( n \), it sets \( v \) to \( i \) and breaks out of the loop.
   - **Checking Subarray Conditions**:
     - It then checks if it can split the array into \( k \) subarrays where each subarray's product of its length and its maximum equals \( v \).
     - It iterates through potential starting points and queries the smallest \( r \) such that \( f(l, r) = i \times v \).
     - If it finds a valid split, it prints the result and returns.
   - **Failing Condition**: If no valid split is found, it prints \(-1\) and returns.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The function correctly handles the querying process and ensures that the constraints are met.
   - The logic for determining the largest \( m \) and checking the subarray conditions is sound.
   - The function adheres to the query limits and prints the correct responses.

### Conclusion:
The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
