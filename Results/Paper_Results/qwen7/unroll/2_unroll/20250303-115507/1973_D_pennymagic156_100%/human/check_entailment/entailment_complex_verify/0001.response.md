### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to determine the largest value \( m \) such that the array can be split into \( k \) subarrays where each subarray's product of its length and its maximum equals \( m \). If no such \( m \) exists, the answer should be \(-1\).

2. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads and returns a list of integers from the input.
   - `func_2()`: Reads and returns an integer from the input.
   - `func_3()`: Reads and returns a map of integers from the input.
   - `func_4()`: Reads and returns a string from the input.
   - `func_5()`: Implements the main logic to find the largest \( m \).

3. **Function 5 (`func_5()`)**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes `v` to 1 and iterates backward through the possible values from \( n \) to 1.
   - **Querying for Maximum Value**:
     - For each value \( i \) from \( n \) to 1, it queries the smallest \( r \) such that \( f(1, r) = i \times n \).
     - If the returned value is \( n \), it sets \( v \) to \( i \) and breaks out of the loop.
   - **Checking Subarray Conditions**:
     - It then checks if it can split the array into \( k \) subarrays where each subarray's product of its length and its maximum equals \( v \).
     - It iterates through potential starting points and queries the smallest \( r \) such that \( f(l, r) = i \times v \).
     - If it finds a valid split, it prints the result and returns.
   - **Failing Condition**: If no valid split is found, it prints \(-1\) and returns.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Backward Iteration for Maximum Value**:
     - The function correctly starts from \( n \) and iterates backward to find the largest possible \( v \) such that \( f(1, r) = i \times n \). This part is correct.
   - **Splitting the Array**:
     - The function attempts to split the array into \( k \) subarrays where each subarray's product of its length and its maximum equals \( v \). However, the logic for checking the subarray conditions is flawed.
     - Specifically, the function uses a fixed step size of 1 in the inner loop, which may not cover all possible valid splits. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3]` and \( k = 3 \), \( v = 6 \), the function might miss the valid split `[1, 2, 3]` and `[3, 3, 3]`.
   - **Query Limits**:
     - The function adheres to the query limits and prints the correct responses. However, the logic for determining the largest \( m \) and checking the subarray conditions is not robust enough to handle all edge cases.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The function fails to ensure that all possible valid splits are considered, leading to potential incorrect results.

**Correctness: **False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
