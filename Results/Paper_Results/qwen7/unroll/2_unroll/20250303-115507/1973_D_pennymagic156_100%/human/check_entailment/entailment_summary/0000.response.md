### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the largest value \( m \) such that the array can be split into exactly \( k \) subarrays where each subarray has a product of its length and its maximum equal to \( m \). If no such \( m \) exists, the answer is \(-1\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: Reads a line of space-separated integers and returns them as a list of strings. This is used to read the dimensions \( n \) and \( k \).
   - **func_2**: Reads an integer input from the user. This is used to get the response from the Fox.
   - **func_3**: Reads a space-separated input and returns a tuple of integers. This is not directly used in the main logic but might be useful for other parts of the code.
   - **func_4**: Reads a string input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. This is not used in the main logic.
   - **func_5**: Implements the main logic to solve the problem.

3. **func_5 Logic**:
   - **Step 1**: Determine the initial value \( v \) by querying the maximum possible value for \( f(1, r) \).
   - **Step 2**: For each potential group, check if it can form a valid subarray with the required product \( v \).
   - **Step 3**: If a valid group is found, continue to the next group. If all groups are checked and no valid group is found, return \(-1\).

4. **Verification**:
   - The function correctly initializes \( v \) by querying the maximum possible value for \( f(1, r) \).
   - It then checks each potential group to see if it can form a valid subarray with the required product \( v \).
   - If a valid group is found, it correctly prints the result and exits.
   - If no valid group is found, it correctly prints \(-1\) and exits.

Given the provided execution summaries and the logic of the function, the function appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
