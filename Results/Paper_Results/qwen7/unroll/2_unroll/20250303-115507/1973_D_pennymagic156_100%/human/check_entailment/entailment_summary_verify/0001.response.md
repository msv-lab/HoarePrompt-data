### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to determine the largest value \( m \) such that the array can be split into \( k \) subarrays where each subarray's product of its length and its maximum equals \( m \). If no such \( m \) exists, the answer should be \(-1\).

2. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads and returns a list of integers from the input.
   - `func_2()`: Reads and returns an integer from the input.
   - `func_3()`: Reads and returns a map of integers from the input.
   - `func_4()`: Reads and returns a string from the input.

3. **Function 5 (`func_5()`)**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes `v` to 1 and iterates backward through the possible values from \( n \) to 1.
   - **Querying for Maximum Value**:
     - For each value \( i \) from \( n \) to 1, it queries the smallest \( r \) such that \( f(1, r) = i \times n \).
     - If the returned value is \( n \), it sets \( v \) to \( i \) and breaks out of the loop.
   - **Checking Subarray Conditions**:
     - It then checks if it can split the array into \( k \) subarrays where each subarray's product of its length and its maximum equals \( v \).
     - It iterates through potential starting points and queries the smallest \( r \) such that \( f(l, r) = i \times v \).
     - If it finds a valid split, it prints the result and returns.
   - **Failing Condition**: If no valid split is found, it prints \(-1\) and returns.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Querying Process**: The function correctly queries for the smallest \( r \) such that \( f(1, r) = i \times n \). This part seems correct.
   - **Setting \( v \)**: The function sets \( v \) to \( i \) when it finds a valid \( r \). This step is crucial for determining the maximum value \( m \).
   - **Splitting the Array**: The function attempts to split the array into \( k \) subarrays where each subarray's product of its length and its maximum equals \( v \). However, the logic for checking the subarray conditions might be flawed.
     - The function uses a fixed increment of 1 for the starting point \( l \) in the inner loop. This approach might miss some valid splits, especially if the array has large gaps between elements.
     - The function assumes that if it cannot find a valid split for a particular \( l \), it should continue to the next \( l \). This might not cover all possible splits, especially if the array has specific patterns that require larger increments.

5. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary states that it divides the integer \( n \) into groups where each group's sum is equal to \( v \), and the number of such groups is \( n//k + 1 \). This is not accurate because the function is actually trying to find subarrays with a specific product, not just dividing the array into groups.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function for checking the subarray conditions might miss some valid splits due to the fixed increment of 1 in the inner loop. Additionally, the function summary is misleading and does not accurately describe the function's behavior.

**Correctness: **False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
