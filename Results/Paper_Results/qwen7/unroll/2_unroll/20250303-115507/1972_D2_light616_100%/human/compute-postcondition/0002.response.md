Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `x` is 1, `cnt` is 0**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them to integers, assigning the first integer to `n` and the second integer to `m`. The values of `x` and `cnt` remain unchanged. Therefore, `n` and `m` are now input integers, while `x` remains 1 and `cnt` remains 0.
