Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y` within specified ranges, and returns a result based on these inputs.**

Given the constraints, the function processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes two integers `x` and `y`, both ranging from 0 to 99. The function does not specify how it processes these values, only that it returns a result based on the inputs. However, since no specific return conditions are given, the focus is on the nature of the inputs and implied processing.
