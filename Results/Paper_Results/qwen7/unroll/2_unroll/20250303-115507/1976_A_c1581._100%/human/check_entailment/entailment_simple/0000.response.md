Reasoning:
1. The program correctly parses the input and separates the password into digits and letters.
2. It sorts the digits and letters separately.
3. It checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order.
4. It checks if the last digit is greater than any preceding letter, which ensures that all digits come before any letters.
5. It constructs a sorted password by concatenating the sorted digits and letters.
6. It compares the sorted password with the original password to ensure they match, meaning the password meets the criteria of being sorted with digits first followed by letters.

Given the logic and the steps described, the function `func_1` correctly verifies whether the password meets the specified conditions.

Correctness: **True**
