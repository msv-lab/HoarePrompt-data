Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'). It returns a list `ans` where each element is the cumulative product of the reversed list `b` from the last element to the current element.**

Note: The description assumes that the function processes the list `a` and the string `s` to generate the list `ans` based on the conditions specified. However, the exact processing logic is not detailed here as per the instruction to focus only on the parameters and return value.
