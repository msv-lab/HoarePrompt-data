### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function `func_1` step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Step 1: Input Reading and Initialization
The program correctly reads the input as specified in the problem statement. It initializes the necessary variables and calls the `func_1` function with the appropriate parameters.

#### Step 2: Function `func_1`
- The function `func_1` constructs a new list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the directions specified in `s`. This part is correct.
- However, the main issue lies in the product calculation part. The original assessment correctly points out that the program does not account for the removal of elements from the array and only considers the elements in the list `b`. This is indeed a mistake.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the product is calculated using the remaining elements of the array `a` after each command is processed. The current implementation calculates the product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, but it does not reflect the actual state of the array `a` after each command.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = (p * v) % m
        ans.append(p)
    return ans
```

In this corrected version:
- We use the variable `p` to keep track of the cumulative product modulo `m`.
- We iterate over the list `b` in reverse order to correctly calculate the product of the remaining elements of the array `a` after each command.

#### Step 3: Output
The final output is printed in reverse order, which is not required by the problem statement. However, since the problem description does not specify the order of the output, this can be considered a minor issue. The main issue is the incorrect handling of the product calculation.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate in pointing out the mistake in the product calculation. However, the provided solution can be fixed by modifying the `func_1` function as shown above.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original program is incorrect due to the mistake in the product calculation. The provided solution can be fixed, but the original assessment accurately identified the issue.
