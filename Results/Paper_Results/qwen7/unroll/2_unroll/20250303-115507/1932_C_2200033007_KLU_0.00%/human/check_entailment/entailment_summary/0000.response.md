Reasoning:
1. The program correctly processes each command in the string `s` and appends the appropriate element from the list `a` to the list `b`.
2. However, there is a logical error in how the product is calculated and appended to the `ans` list.
3. The current implementation of `func_1` constructs `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the direction specified in `s`, but it does not actually compute the product of the remaining elements in `a` after each removal.
4. Instead, it reverses `b` and computes the cumulative product from the end to the start, which does not match the required behavior.
5. The correct approach should involve computing the product of the remaining elements in `a` after each removal and appending the result to `ans`.

Given these points, the current implementation does not correctly follow the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
