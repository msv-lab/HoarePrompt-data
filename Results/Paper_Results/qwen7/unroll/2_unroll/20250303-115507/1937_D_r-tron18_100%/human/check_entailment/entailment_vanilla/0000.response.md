Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a one-dimensional grid of length \( n \).
   - Each cell contains a character `'<>'`, indicating the direction the pinball should move.
   - The pinball starts at each cell and moves according to the rules until it leaves the grid.
   - We need to calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

2. **Given Functions:**
   - `func_1(arr, times)`: This function calculates a value based on the array `arr` and an integer `times`. However, this function is not directly relevant to solving the main problem.
   - `func_2(s1, n)`: This function processes the input string `s1` and calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

3. **Analysis of `func_2(s1, n)`:**
   - The function initializes several lists and accumulates values.
   - It iterates through the string `s1` in reverse order.
   - For each character, it calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid using various conditions and accumulated values.
   - The logic involves checking the direction of the pinball (`>` or `<`) and updating the positions accordingly.

4. **Key Points to Verify:**
   - The function correctly handles the movement of the pinball based on the direction specified in the string.
   - The function accounts for the inversion of directions after each move.
   - The function correctly calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

5. **Verification:**
   - The provided example test cases show the expected output for different inputs.
   - The function `func_2` seems to handle the logic correctly by maintaining the necessary accumulations and conditions.
   - The output matches the expected results for the given examples.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_2` processes the input string and calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position accurately.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
