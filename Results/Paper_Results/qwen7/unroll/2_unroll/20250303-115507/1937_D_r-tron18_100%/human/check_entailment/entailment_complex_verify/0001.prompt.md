You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a one-dimensional grid of length \( n \).
   - Each cell contains a character `'<>'`, indicating the direction the pinball should move.
   - The pinball starts at each cell and moves according to the rules until it leaves the grid.
   - We need to calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

2. **Given Functions:**
   - `func_1(arr, times)`: This function calculates a value based on the array `arr` and an integer `times`. However, this function is not directly relevant to solving the main problem.
   - `func_2(s1, n)`: This function processes the input string `s1` and calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

3. **Analysis of `func_2(s1, n)`:**
   - The function initializes several lists and accumulates values.
   - It iterates through the string `s1` in reverse order.
   - For each character, it calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid using various conditions and accumulated values.
   - The logic involves checking the direction of the pinball (`>` or `<`) and updating the positions accordingly.

4. **Key Points to Verify:**
   - The function correctly handles the movement of the pinball based on the direction specified in the string.
   - The function accounts for the inversion of directions after each move.
   - The function correctly calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

5. **Verification:**
   - The provided example test cases show the expected output for different inputs.
   - The function `func_2` seems to handle the logic correctly by maintaining the necessary accumulations and conditions.
   - The output matches the expected results for the given examples.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_2` processes the input string and calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position accurately.
