Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is designed to compute a specific value based on the last positions of the pinball over time. However, it is not directly relevant to the main logic of calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid. Its purpose seems to be supporting `func_2`.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function is central to solving the problem. It processes the string `s1` and computes the time it takes for a pinball starting at each cell to leave the grid. Here's a breakdown of its logic:
   - It initializes some variables to keep track of positions where the direction changes (`pre`), the total number of such positions (`totalOne`), and accumulates these positions into `preOne`.
   - It then iterates through the string from right to left, updating the answers for each cell based on the balance of '<' and '>' characters.
   - For each cell, it calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid using the accumulated positions and the `func_1` function.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the logic in `func_2` appears to correctly implement the rules for the pinball's movement and accurately calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting cell.

Since `func_2` correctly implements the required logic and there are no apparent errors in the provided code, the program should be considered correct.

Correctness: **True**
