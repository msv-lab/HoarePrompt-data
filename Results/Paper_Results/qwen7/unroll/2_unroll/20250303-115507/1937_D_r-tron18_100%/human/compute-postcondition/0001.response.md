Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`.**

Explanation: The code `totalOne = len(pre)` calculates the length of the list `pre`, which contains indices (i+1) for each occurrence of '>' in the string `s1`. This length is then assigned to the variable `totalOne`. The values of `s1` and `pre` remain unchanged, and `n` is still an integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5.
