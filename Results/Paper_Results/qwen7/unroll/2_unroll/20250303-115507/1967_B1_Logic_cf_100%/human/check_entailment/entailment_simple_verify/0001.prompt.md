You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 \cdot 10^6, and the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        
        ans = n
        
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, and for each T in the range of t, there exists a corresponding ans which is calculated based on the given formula, and these ans values are printed individually for each T.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`. This suggests that the program might be counting pairs `(a, b)` where `a` ranges from `1` to `n`.

3. **Loop for Calculating Valid Pairs:**
   - The loop iterates over values of `b` from `2` to `min(n, m)`.
   - For each `b`, the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` is added to `ans`.

4. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is not explicitly checked in the provided code.
   - Instead, the code adds a value to `ans` without verifying the condition.

5. **Output:**
   - The final value of `ans` is printed for each test case.

### Verification of the Logic:

- The condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is crucial for determining valid pairs.
- The provided code does not check this condition at all. It simply adds a value to `ans` for each `b` in the range, which does not guarantee that the pairs satisfy the required condition.

### Example Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1:** `n = 1`, `m = 1`
  - Expected output: `1` (only pair `(1, 1)`).
  - Actual output: `1` (correct).

- **Test Case 2:** `n = 2`, `m = 3`
  - Expected output: `3` (pairs `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 1)`).
  - Actual output: `3` (correct).

- **Test Case 3:** `n = 3`, `m = 5`
  - Expected output: `4` (pairs `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(1, 3)`, `(2, 1)`).
  - Actual output: `4` (correct).

- **Test Case 4:** `n = 10`, `m = 8`
  - Expected output: `14` (multiple pairs satisfying the condition).
  - Actual output: `14` (correct).

- **Test Case 5:** `n = 100`, `m = 1233`
  - Expected output: `153` (multiple pairs satisfying the condition).
  - Actual output: `153` (correct).

- **Test Case 6:** `n = 1000000`, `m = 1145141`
  - Expected output: `1643498` (multiple pairs satisfying the condition).
  - Actual output: `1643498` (correct).

### Conclusion:

While the provided code gives the correct output for the given examples, it does not correctly implement the logic required to count valid pairs based on the given condition. The code simply increments a counter without checking the necessary condition.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
