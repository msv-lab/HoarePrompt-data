### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- The function `func_1` aims to update the list `row` such that the cost of installing supports in each cell is calculated according to the problem constraints.
- The function increments the cost of each cell from index `d-1` to the end by 1 plus the minimum value of the previous `d` elements (including itself if applicable).
- The function returns the last element of the updated list `row`.

However, there are a few issues with this function:
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The function does not correctly handle the cost calculation for ensuring that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`. It only considers the minimum value of the previous `d` elements, which does not guarantee the correct cost calculation.
2. **Mandatory Supports**: The function does not explicitly enforce the mandatory installation of supports in the first and last columns of the row.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- The function `func_2` processes the input data and calculates the total cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows.
- It uses `func_1` to compute the cost for each row and then sums up the costs for each set of `k` consecutive rows.
- The function returns the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

Given these observations, let's consider the provided example to see if the program works correctly:

**Example Input:**
```
3 4 1 2
0 1 2 0
0 2 1 0
0 1 2 0
```

**Expected Output:**
The expected minimum total cost of installing supports should be 4.

**Actual Output:**
- For the second row `[0, 2, 1, 0]`:
  - The function `func_1` calculates the cost as follows:
    - For the first cell (0, 1): cost = 1 (since it's the first support and mandatory)
    - For the second cell (0, 2): cost = min([1]) + 1 = 2
    - For the third cell (0, 3): cost = min([2]) + 1 = 3
  - Thus, the total cost for the second row would be 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, which is incorrect.

This example clearly shows that the program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost of installing supports. The function `func_1` does not handle the cost calculation according to the problem description, and the mandatory installation of supports in the first and last columns is not enforced.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
