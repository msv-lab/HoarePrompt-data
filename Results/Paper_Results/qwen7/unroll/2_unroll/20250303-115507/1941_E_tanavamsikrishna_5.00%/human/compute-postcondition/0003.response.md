Output State: **`total_costs` is an empty list, `costs` is a list of results from applying `func_1(row, d)` to each row in `rows`, where each result is a positive integer representing the cost calculated for each row.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `total_costs`. The list `costs` remains unchanged as no operations are performed on it within the given code snippet. Each element in `costs` still represents the cost calculated for each row using `func_1(row, d)`.
