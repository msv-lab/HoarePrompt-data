t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5; for each edge, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and represent the vertices connected by the edge; the adjacency list adj is constructed based on the input edges, where adj[i] is a list of integers representing the neighbors of vertex i.
