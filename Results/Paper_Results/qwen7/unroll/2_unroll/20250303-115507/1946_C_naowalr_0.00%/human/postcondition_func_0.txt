The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer `n` (number of vertices) and another positive integer `k` (a specific condition). For each test case, it constructs an adjacency list representing the graph's structure. It then performs a binary search to find the maximum number of edges that can be removed while ensuring the graph remains connected, with the constraint that the number of cuts does not exceed `k`. The function outputs the result for each test case, which is the maximum number of edges that can be removed under the given constraints.
