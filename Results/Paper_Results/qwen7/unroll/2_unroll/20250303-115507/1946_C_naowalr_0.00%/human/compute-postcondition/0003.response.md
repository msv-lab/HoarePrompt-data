Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through an adjacency list `adj` containing the connections between vertices in a graph, where `t` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are positive integers defining the range of vertices and a specific condition, respectively. The function returns information based on the adjacency list and the given conditions for each test case.**
