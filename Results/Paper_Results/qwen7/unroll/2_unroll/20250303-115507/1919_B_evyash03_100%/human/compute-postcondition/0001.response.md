Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains three variables: `char`, `expression`, and implicitly `index` (which is automatically managed by the `for` loop).

2. **Determine the Initial State of Each Variable**:
   - `count` is initially 0.
   - `expression` is a string consisting of characters `+` and `-`.
   - `length` is an integer representing the length of the string `expression`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will iterate over each character in the string `expression`. The loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the string.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `char` will take on each character in `expression` one by one during the loop iterations.
   - The variable `expression` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
   - The variable `length` also remains unchanged throughout the loop.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing. This means `expression` must have at least one character for the loop to begin.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `count` is 0.
- `expression` must have at least one character.
- `length` is the length of `expression`, which is at least 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`count` is 0, `expression` must have at least one character, `length` is the length of `expression`**.
