Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`.
2. The penalty for a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
3. The provided program only counts the number of '+' and '-' in the string `expression` and calculates a simple difference between the counts. This does not correctly implement the logic required to minimize the penalty.
4. The function `func_1` should aim to split the array `a` into subarrays such that the sum of penalties is minimized. However, the current implementation simply returns the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-', which does not consider the optimal splitting strategy.
5. For example, in the third test case (`--+++++++-`), the correct answer is 0, but the program would incorrectly return 4 because it does not account for the optimal way to split the array.

Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not implement the logic to find the optimal splits that minimize the penalty.
