Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`.
2. The penalty for a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
3. The function `func_1` currently counts the number of '+' and '-' in the string `expression` and calculates the absolute difference between the counts. However, this approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array `a` to minimize the penalty.
4. Let's analyze the function summary and the provided code:
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of '+' characters in the string `expression` and calculates the difference between the length of the string and this count.
   - It then returns the absolute value of the difference between this calculated difference and the count of '+' characters.
5. Given the function summary, the function `func_1` actually aims to balance the number of '+' and '-' characters as closely as possible, which is a key part of minimizing the penalty. Specifically, it tries to create subarrays with equal numbers of '+' and '-' characters, thereby minimizing the absolute sum of each subarray.
6. For example, in the third test case (`--+++++++-`):
   - The function counts 1 '+' and 7 '-' characters.
   - The difference between the length and the count of '+' is \(8 - 1 = 7\).
   - The absolute difference between this difference and the count of '+' is \(|7 - 1| = 6\).
   - However, the optimal solution is to split the array into `([-1, -1], [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1])`, resulting in a penalty of \(2 \times 2 + 8 \times 1 = 0\).
7. The function `func_1` does not explicitly handle the optimal splitting logic, but it does attempt to balance the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is a crucial step towards minimizing the penalty.
8. The provided program does not fully implement the optimal splitting logic, but it does attempt to balance the counts, which is a necessary step. Therefore, the function `func_1` does not completely solve the problem, but it does contribute to the correct approach.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate in pointing out that the program does not fully implement the optimal splitting logic. However, the function `func_1` does attempt to balance the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is a critical step towards minimizing the penalty.

Final: **False**
