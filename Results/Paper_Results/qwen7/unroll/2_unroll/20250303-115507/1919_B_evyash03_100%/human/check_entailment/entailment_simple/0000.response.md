Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Penalty**: The function `func_1` calculates the penalty incorrectly. According to the problem statement, the penalty is the sum of the penalties of the subarrays formed by splitting the array `a` into non-empty subarrays. Each subarray's penalty is calculated as the absolute value of the sum of its elements multiplied by its length. However, the current implementation simply returns the absolute value of the difference between the number of `+` and `-` characters in the string `expression`.

2. **No Actual Splitting Logic**: The program does not actually perform the optimal splitting of the array `a` into subarrays to minimize the total penalty. It only counts the number of `+` and `-` characters and computes a simple difference, which does not reflect the actual penalty calculation as per the problem statement.

3. **Incorrect Return Value**: The return value of the function should be the minimum possible penalty, but the current implementation returns a value that does not correspond to any valid penalty calculation based on the problem description.

Given these points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
