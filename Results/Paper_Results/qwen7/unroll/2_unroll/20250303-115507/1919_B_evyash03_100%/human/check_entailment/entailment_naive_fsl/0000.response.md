Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` simply counts the number of '+' characters and calculates the difference between the number of '-' and '+' characters. This approach does not guarantee the minimum penalty as it does not consider the optimal way to split the array.

For example, consider the input:
```
length = 6
expression = "--++--"
```
The program would output:
```
0
```
However, the optimal split would be `([--++], [--])`, which results in a penalty of `4 + 2 = 6`.

The program fails to handle the optimal splitting of the array to minimize the penalty, thus it is incorrect.
