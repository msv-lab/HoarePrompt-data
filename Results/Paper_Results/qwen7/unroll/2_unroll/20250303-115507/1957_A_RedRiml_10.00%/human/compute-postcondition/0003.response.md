Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, w is an integer representing the number of iterations of the loop, each iteration processes a line (ln) and a list of integers (palka), then calculates and prints the number of unique integers in palka that appear at least 3 times across all iterations.
