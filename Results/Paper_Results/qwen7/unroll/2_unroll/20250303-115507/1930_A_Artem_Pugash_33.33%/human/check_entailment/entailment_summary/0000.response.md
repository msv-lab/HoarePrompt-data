Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases (`numCases`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting**: For each test case, the program reads `2n` integers, sorts them in ascending order, and then iterates through the sorted list in pairs.
3. **Summing Minimum Values**: During each iteration, the program takes the first two elements from the sorted list, calculates the minimum of these two values, and adds it to the cumulative score (`suma`).
4. **Output**: After processing all pairs, the program prints the cumulative score for each test case.

Given this analysis, the program correctly follows the steps required to achieve the maximum final score by always selecting the smallest available pair of integers, which ensures the highest possible score according to the rules of the game.

Correctness: **True**
