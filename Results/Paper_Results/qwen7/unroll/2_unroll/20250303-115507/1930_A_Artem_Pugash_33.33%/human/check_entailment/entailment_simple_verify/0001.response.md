### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - The code correctly handles the input for each test case by reading the number of integers `numInteger` and then the list of integers as strings, which is then split into a list of integers.

2. **Sorting**: The list of numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order using `numbers.sort(reverse=False)`. This ensures that the smallest numbers are always chosen first when pairs are selected.
   - Sorting the list in non-decreasing order is a valid approach to ensure that the minimum values are always selected first.

3. **Pair Selection and Scoring**: For each pair of numbers, the minimum value is added to the score. Since the list is sorted, the minimum values are always the first two elements in the list at each iteration.
   - The code correctly selects the first two elements from the sorted list, pops them, and adds the minimum of these two elements to the score. This ensures that the smallest available numbers are always paired together.

4. **Loop Termination**: The loop continues until all numbers are processed, which happens after exactly \( n \) iterations since \( n \) pairs are formed.
   - The loop runs while `numbers` is not empty, and since each iteration removes two elements, the loop will terminate after \( n \) iterations, ensuring that all \( 2n \) integers are processed.

5. **Output**: The score is printed for each test case.
   - The score is correctly calculated and printed for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the function, the program correctly computes the maximum final score by always selecting the smallest available numbers to maximize the sum of the minimums.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem and produces the correct output for each test case.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
