Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \) and the list of \( 2n \) integers.
3. It sorts the list of integers in ascending order.
4. It iteratively pops the first two elements from the sorted list, adds the smaller of the two to the total score, and continues until the list is empty.
5. The logic ensures that at each step, the smallest available pair is chosen, which maximizes the score because the smallest elements contribute to the sum.
6. The program outputs the total score for each test case, which matches the requirements of the problem statement.

Given this analysis, the program appears to follow the optimal strategy for maximizing the score, as it always selects the smallest available pair of numbers.

Correctness: **True**
