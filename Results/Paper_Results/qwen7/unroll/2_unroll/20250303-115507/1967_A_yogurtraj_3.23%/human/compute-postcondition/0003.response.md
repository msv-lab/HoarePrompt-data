Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes a list of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}), and a list a containing n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{12}). For each test case, the function returns a result based on the given inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with specific parameters and a list of integers. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case without accepting any parameters directly within its definition.
