Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves rearranging cards to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that form a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`. We can buy up to `k` additional cards to achieve this.

2. **Input Parsing**: The function correctly parses the number of test cases, `n`, and `k`, and the initial count of each type of card.

3. **Sorting and Initial Setup**: The function sorts the counts of cards, which is a good start to identify the gaps in the sequence.

4. **Key Logic Analysis**:
   - The function aims to find the highest possible value `r` such that we can adjust the counts to form as many permutations as possible.
   - It iterates through the sorted list of card counts, adjusting `k` and calculating the remaining budget (`rem`) and the number of additional positions needed (`y`).
   - If the remaining budget is zero, it calculates the maximum score directly.
   - If there is still budget left after the loop, it adjusts the last value and calculates the score.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the remaining budget is zero after the loop.
   - It correctly calculates the score using the adjusted value `r`.

6. **Output**: The function prints the calculated score for each test case.

Given the analysis, the provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles the sorting, budget adjustment, and score calculation appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
