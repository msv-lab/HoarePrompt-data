Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}. The list a contains n integers a_i such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{12}, representing the number of cards of each type after the loop has executed all iterations. The value of r is determined based on the final state of the loop, and the values of rem and y are calculated as needed during the loop's execution. The final output prints the result based on the last value of r, rem, and y.
