Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. It initializes a dictionary `d` using `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') in the input string `s`.
3. For each test case, it populates the dictionary `d` with the counts of each difficulty level.
4. It then calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level by comparing the count in the dictionary `d` with the required number of rounds `m`. If the count is less than or equal to `m`, it adds `m - d[val]` to the answer `ans`.
5. Finally, it prints the total number of additional problems needed for the current test case.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic appears to be correct. The program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
