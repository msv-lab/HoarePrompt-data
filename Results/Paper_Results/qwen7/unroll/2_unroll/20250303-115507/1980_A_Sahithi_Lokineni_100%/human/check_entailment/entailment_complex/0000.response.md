Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input for multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the string `s`.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes a dictionary `d` using `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') in the string `s`. This is done correctly.

3. **Counting Problems**: For each character in the string `s`, it increments the corresponding count in the dictionary `d`. This step is also correct.

4. **Calculating Minimum Additional Problems**: The program calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed to ensure that there are at least `m` problems of each difficulty level. This is done by iterating over the keys of the dictionary `d` and checking if the count of any difficulty level is less than `m`. If so, it adds the difference `(m - d[val])` to the answer `ans`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is the value of `ans`.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where the number of problems in the bank might be insufficient for the required rounds. It correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
