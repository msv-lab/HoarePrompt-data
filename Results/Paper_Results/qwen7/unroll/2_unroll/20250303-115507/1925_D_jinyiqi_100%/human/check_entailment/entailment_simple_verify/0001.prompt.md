You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

Each result is calculated based on the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` for that specific iteration, along with the cumulative sum of `f` values from the inner loop, modulo `M` (1000000007).



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of children `n`, pairs of friends `m`, and the number of excursions `k`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `M` is initialized to \(10^9 + 7\), which is used for modulo operations.
   - The variable `sum_f` is initialized to 0 to store the sum of all friendship values.

3. **Summing Friendship Values:**
   - The program iterates through each of the `m` pairs of friends and sums their friendship values into `sum_f`.

4. **Calculating Expected Value:**
   - The formula used to calculate the expected value involves several components:
     - `cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2` calculates the total number of unique pairs of children.
     - `p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` computes the numerator of the expected value.
     - `q = 2 * cn2 ** 2` computes the denominator of the expected value.
   - The program then uses the greatest common divisor (gcd) to simplify the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\).

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Finally, the program prints the result of \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7)\).

### Verification:

1. **Correctness of Summing Friendship Values:**
   - The program correctly sums the friendship values for all given pairs of friends.

2. **Correctness of Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The formula used to compute the expected value is correct based on the problem statement. The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions is derived correctly.

3. **Simplification Using GCD:**
   - The use of gcd to simplify the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) ensures that the result is in its simplest form.

4. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The use of modular arithmetic with \(10^9 + 7\) is appropriate and correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic and calculations are correct according to the problem description. The program follows the steps outlined in the problem and handles the required operations accurately.

Correctness: **True**
