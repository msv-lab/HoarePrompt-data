Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that the friendship value of a pair increases by 1 for each excursion it is chosen, and it does not handle the calculation of the expected value properly.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
2 1 1
1 2 1
```

Expected output:
```
1
```

However, the provided program will output `0` because it calculates the sum of friendship values without considering the increase in friendship values for each excursion. The correct approach would involve calculating the probability of each pair being chosen and updating the friendship values accordingly.

Here's a brief outline of what the correct solution should do:
1. Calculate the initial sum of friendship values.
2. For each excursion, update the friendship values of the chosen pairs.
3. Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k excursions.

The given program does not implement these steps correctly, leading to incorrect results.
