Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The formula used to calculate `p` and `q` does not correctly represent the expected value of the sum of friendship values.
   - The expected value should consider the probability of picking each pair and how the friendship value changes over the excursions.

2. **Incorrect Handling of GCD:**
   - The calculation of the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the simplification of `p` and `q` might not be appropriate for the expected value calculation.

3. **Modular Inverse:**
   - The use of modular inverse (`pow(q, -1, M)`) without ensuring that `q` is coprime with `M` (which it isn't in this context) can lead to incorrect results.

4. **Incorrect Formula for Expected Value:**
   - The formula `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` does not correctly model the expected increase in friendship values over the excursions.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion. Here's a corrected approach:

1. **Calculate the Probability of Picking Each Pair:**
   - Each pair has an equal probability of being picked in each excursion.
   - The probability of picking a specific pair in one excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

2. **Expected Increase in Friendship Value:**
   - For each pair of friends, the expected increase in friendship value over `k` excursions is \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \).

3. **Sum of Expected Values:**
   - Sum the expected increases for all pairs of friends.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        sum_f = 0
        for j in range(m):
            (a, b, f) = map(int, input().split())
            sum_f += f
        # Expected increase in friendship value for each pair of friends
        expected_increase = k * (k + 1) // 2
        result = (sum_f * expected_increase) % M
        print(result)

func()
```

This code correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
