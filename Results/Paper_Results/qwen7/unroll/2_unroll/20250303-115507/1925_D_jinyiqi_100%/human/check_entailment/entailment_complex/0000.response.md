Reasoning:

The annotated program seems to follow the problem statement correctly. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and calculations involved:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Sum of Friendship Values**: It calculates the sum of all friendship values (`sum_f`) for the given pairs of friends.

3. **Combinatorial Calculation**: 
   - `cn2` is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n`, which is `n * (n - 1) / 2`.
   - The formula `p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` is derived from the expected value calculation. This formula accounts for the initial sum of friendship values and the additional expected increase due to the probability of choosing the same pair multiple times.
   - `q = 2 * cn2 ** 2` represents the denominator in the fraction form of the expected value.

4. **GCD Calculation**: The greatest common divisor (gcd) of `p` and `q` is computed to simplify the fraction.

5. **Modular Inverse and Result Calculation**: 
   - The modular inverse of `q` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is computed using `pow(q, -1, M)`.
   - The result is then calculated as `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)`.

6. **Output**: The result for each test case is printed.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the program appears to correctly implement the solution. The logic and calculations align with the problem requirements, and the use of modular arithmetic ensures that the result fits within the specified bounds.

Correctness: **True**
