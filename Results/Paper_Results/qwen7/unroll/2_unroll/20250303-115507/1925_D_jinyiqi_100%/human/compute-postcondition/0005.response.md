Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t, followed by several pairs of integers n, m, and k, and a series of m lines each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i. The function returns nothing explicitly but performs operations based on the given inputs to process and analyze the friendship relationships among n people, ensuring all pairs of friends are distinct and adhering to specified constraints.**

This functionality involves accepting a structured input format that describes multiple test cases, each containing details about the number of people, the number of friendships, and additional parameters, along with specific friendship details. The function then processes these inputs to perform some form of analysis or computation related to the friendship relationships, without returning any explicit output value.
