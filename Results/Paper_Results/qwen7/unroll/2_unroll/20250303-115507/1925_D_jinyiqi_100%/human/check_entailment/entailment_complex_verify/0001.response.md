### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of children `n`, pairs of friends `m`, and the number of excursions `k`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `M` is initialized to \(10^9 + 7\), which is used for modulo operations.
   - The variable `sum_f` is initialized to 0 to store the sum of all friendship values.

3. **Summing Friendship Values:**
   - The program iterates through each of the `m` pairs of friends and sums their friendship values into `sum_f`.

4. **Calculating Expected Value:**
   - The formula used to calculate the expected value involves several components:
     - `cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2` calculates the total number of unique pairs of children.
     - `p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` computes the numerator of the expected value.
     - `q = 2 * cn2 ** 2` computes the denominator of the expected value.
   - The program then uses the greatest common divisor (gcd) to simplify the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\).

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Finally, the program prints the result of \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7)\).

### Detailed Verification:

1. **Summing Friendship Values:**
   - The program correctly sums the friendship values for all given pairs of friends. This part is correct.

2. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The formula used to compute the expected value is correct based on the problem statement. Specifically, the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all \(k\) pairs chosen for the excursions is derived correctly. However, let's verify the formula:
     - The expected value for a single excursion is the sum of friendship values divided by the total number of pairs (\(cn2\)).
     - Since the friendship value increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion if the same pair is chosen, the expected value for \(k\) excursions is the sum of the expected values for each excursion.
     - The formula \(p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)\) and \(q = 2 * cn2 ** 2\) is derived from the expected value calculation, but we need to ensure it correctly captures the expected increase in friendship values.

3. **Simplification Using GCD:**
   - The use of gcd to simplify the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) ensures that the result is in its simplest form. This part is correct.

4. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The use of modular arithmetic with \(10^9 + 7\) is appropriate and correctly implemented. This ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

### Specific Issues:

- **Formula for Expected Value:**
  - The formula \(p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)\) and \(q = 2 * cn2 ** 2\) seems to be an approximation rather than the exact expected value. The exact expected value should consider the probability of choosing each pair and the expected increase in friendship values over \(k\) excursions.
  - The given formula might not fully capture the expected value due to the simplifications made.

### Conclusion:

After re-evaluating the program, while the overall structure and logic seem correct, the specific formula used for the expected value calculation might not be entirely accurate. The program might produce incorrect results for certain edge cases or large inputs.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The program might produce incorrect results due to the simplified formula for the expected value.
