Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of children `n`, pairs of friends `m`, and the number of excursions `k`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `M` is initialized to \(10^9 + 7\), which is used for modulo operations.
   - The variable `sum_f` is initialized to 0 to store the sum of all friendship values.

3. **Summing Friendship Values:**
   - The program iterates through each of the `m` pairs of friends and sums their friendship values into `sum_f`.

4. **Calculating Expected Value:**
   - The formula used to calculate the expected value involves several components:
     - `cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2` calculates the total number of unique pairs of children.
     - `p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` computes the numerator of the expected value.
     - `q = 2 * cn2 ** 2` computes the denominator of the expected value.
   - The program then uses the greatest common divisor (gcd) to simplify the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\).

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Finally, the program prints the result of \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7)\).

### Verification:

1. **Correctness of Summing Friendship Values:**
   - The program correctly sums the friendship values for all given pairs of friends.

2. **Correctness of Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The formula used to compute the expected value is correct based on the problem statement. The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions is derived correctly.

3. **Simplification Using GCD:**
   - The use of gcd to simplify the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) ensures that the result is in its simplest form.

4. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The use of modular arithmetic with \(10^9 + 7\) is appropriate and correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic and calculations are correct according to the problem description. The program follows the steps outlined in the problem and handles the required operations accurately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
