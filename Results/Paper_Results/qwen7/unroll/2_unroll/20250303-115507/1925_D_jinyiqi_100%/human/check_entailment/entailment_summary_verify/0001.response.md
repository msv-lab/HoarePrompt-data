### Reasoning:

The original assessment concluded that the program is correct based on the problem description. However, upon closer inspection, we need to verify the correctness of the formula used to calculate the expected value.

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Summing Friendship Values:**
   - The program correctly sums the friendship values for all given pairs of friends. This part is accurate.

2. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The formula used in the program is:
     \[
     p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
     \]
     \[
     q = 2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2
     \]
   - Here, \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\) represents the total number of unique pairs of children.
   - The numerator \(p\) accounts for the expected increase in friendship values due to the excursions and the initial values.
   - The denominator \(q\) normalizes the expected value.

3. **Simplification Using GCD:**
   - The program correctly simplifies the fraction using the greatest common divisor (gcd).

4. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The use of modular arithmetic with \(10^9 + 7\) is appropriate and correctly implemented.

However, let's re-examine the expected value calculation step-by-step to ensure it aligns with the problem statement.

- The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions should be calculated as follows:
  - Each pair of friends has a probability of \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\) of being chosen in any given excursion.
  - The expected increase in the friendship value for a pair of friends after k excursions is \(k\).
  - Therefore, the expected value for the sum of friendship values is:
    \[
    \text{Expected Value} = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \right) \cdot k
    \]

Given this, the program's current formula seems to overcomplicate the calculation. The simplified formula should directly use the sum of friendship values and the number of excursions.

#### Corrected Formula:
- The correct formula should be:
  \[
  \text{Expected Value} = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \right) \cdot k
  \]
- The program should directly compute this and then handle the modulo operation.

### Conclusion:

The original program uses a more complex formula than necessary, which might lead to incorrect results in certain edge cases. The simplified formula directly addresses the problem statement without unnecessary complexity.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it uses a more complex formula than necessary, leading to potential inaccuracies.
