Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5·10^4, M is 1000000007, each iteration of the loop processes different inputs for n, m, and k, calculates a value based on these inputs, performs GCD operations, and prints the result modulo M. After all iterations, the values of t and M remain unchanged, but the printed results from each iteration are determined by the specific inputs provided during those iterations.
