You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program:
import math

func_1()

def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        if x > 0 and y > 0:
            bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
            x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
            bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
            print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        elif x == 0 and y > 0:
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
        elif x > 0 and y == 0:
            print(math.ceil(x / 15))
        else:
            print(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases (up to 10,000). For each test case, it reads two integers \(x\) and \(y\) (both between 0 and 99). Based on the values of \(x\) and \(y\), it calculates and prints one of the following:
- The sum of \(\left\lceil \frac{y}{2} \right\rceil\) and \(\left\lceil \frac{x - \left\lceil \frac{y}{2} \right\rceil \times 15 + y \times 4}{15} \right\rceil\) if both \(x\) and \(y\) are positive.
- \(\left\lceil \frac{y}{2} \right\rceil\) if only \(y\) is positive.
- \(\left\lceil \frac{x}{15} \right\rceil\) if only \(x\) is positive.
- 0 if both \(x\) and \(y\) are zero.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to place icons on screens where each screen is a 5x3 grid.
   - Icons can be either 1x1 or 2x2.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of screens used.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code starts by calling `func_1()`, which is defined later.
   - `func_1()` takes input and processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
   - The logic inside the function is designed to calculate the minimum number of screens needed.

3. **Breaking Down the Logic:**
   - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
     - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)` calculates the number of full 2x2 icons that can fit into the remaining space after placing all 1x1 icons.
     - `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` adjusts the remaining 1x1 icons after accounting for the space taken by 2x2 icons.
     - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)` calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
     - The total number of screens is `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`.
   - If only `y` is greater than 0:
     - The number of screens needed is `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
   - If only `x` is greater than 0:
     - The number of screens needed is `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
   - If both `x` and `y` are 0:
     - No screens are needed, so the result is 0.

4. **Testing the Logic:**
   - The example provided in the problem statement matches the logic implemented in the code.
   - For instance, for the test case `(1, 1)`, the code correctly calculates that one screen is needed.
   - Similarly, for the test case `(7, 2)`, the code correctly calculates that one screen is needed.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases like when `x` or `y` is zero correctly.
   - It also correctly calculates the number of screens needed for mixed cases.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of screens needed to place the icons as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness:** **True**
