Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `x` and `y`.
3. The logic for calculating the minimum number of screens is as follows:
   - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, the program calculates the number of full 2x2 icons (`bxsfory`) that can fit and then adjusts `x` accordingly. It then calculates how many additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons (`x`), considering that 15 1x1 icons can fit on one screen.
   - If only `y` is greater than 0, it directly calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
   - If only `x` is greater than 0, it directly calculates the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons.
   - If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0, indicating no screens are needed.

4. The calculations and logic seem to follow the problem statement accurately, ensuring that the minimum number of screens is used.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
