Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly determining if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping as described. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Check for Non-Decreasing Array**: The initial check `check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])` only checks if the array is already non-decreasing. This is not sufficient because the problem allows for rearrangement by splitting and swapping.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting and Swapping**: The logic for checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping is flawed. Specifically, the inner loop checks only one possible split point and does not consider all possible splits.

3. **Break Statements**: The use of `break` statements in the inner loop prematurely ends the loop, which may lead to incorrect results.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the array is already non-decreasing
        if all(a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)):
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        # Try all possible splits and check if the resulting array is non-decreasing
        for i in range(1, n):
            x = a[:i]
            y = a[i:]
            if all(y[j - 1] <= y[j] for j in range(1, len(y))) and all(x[j - 1] <= x[j] for j in range(1, len(x))):
                print('YES')
                break
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version:
- Checks if the array is already non-decreasing.
- Iterates over all possible split points.
- Checks if the resulting arrays (both the prefix and the suffix) are non-decreasing.
- Prints 'YES' if any valid split and swap makes the array non-decreasing, otherwise prints 'NO'.
