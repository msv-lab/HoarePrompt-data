Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `sums`**:
   - The logic for calculating `sums` is flawed. It incorrectly subtracts twice the sum of the smallest `x` elements and then adds back the removed elements without proper consideration of the optimal strategy.
   
2. **Unnecessary Complexity**:
   - The nested loop and the way `sums` is updated are overly complex and do not reflect the optimal strategy for both players.

3. **Optimal Strategy Not Properly Implemented**:
   - Alice should remove the smallest elements to minimize the negative impact on the total sum.
   - Bob should flip the smallest positive elements to minimize the sum further.

### Correct Solution:
Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        # Remove k smallest elements
        a = a[k:]
        
        # Bob will flip at most x smallest positive elements
        pos_elements = [a[i] for i in range(len(a)) if a[i] > 0]
        neg_elements = [a[i] for i in range(len(a)) if a[i] <= 0]
        
        # If there are fewer than x positive elements, flip all of them
        if len(pos_elements) <= x:
            pos_elements = [-p for p in pos_elements]
        else:
            # Flip the x smallest positive elements
            pos_elements = sorted(pos_elements)[:x]
            pos_elements = [-p for p in pos_elements]
        
        # Calculate the final sum
        final_sum = sum(neg_elements + pos_elements)
        print(final_sum)


func()
```

This solution correctly implements the optimal strategy for both players:
- Alice removes the smallest `k` elements.
- Bob flips the smallest `x` positive elements.

This ensures the sum of the array is calculated correctly according to the optimal play of both players.
