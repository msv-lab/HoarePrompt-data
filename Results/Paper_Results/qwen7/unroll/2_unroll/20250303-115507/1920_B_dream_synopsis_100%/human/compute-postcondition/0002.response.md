Output State: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, and x are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000 for all i. After executing the loop, the variable ans contains a list of maximum sums calculated based on the conditions provided in the loop. The final output prints the maximum value from the ans list for each test case.
