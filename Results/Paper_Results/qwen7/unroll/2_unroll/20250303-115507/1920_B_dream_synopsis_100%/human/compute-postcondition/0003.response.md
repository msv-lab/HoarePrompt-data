Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a result based on the values of `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a`.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each defined by `n`, `k`, `x`, and a list of integers `a`. For each test case, the function performs some operation based on these inputs and returns the result accordingly.
