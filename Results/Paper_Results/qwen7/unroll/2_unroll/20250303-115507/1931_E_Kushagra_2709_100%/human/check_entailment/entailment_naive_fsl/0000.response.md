Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules described. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `zerocnts` do not accurately simulate the game's logic. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Game Logic Mismatch**: The functions do not properly simulate the turns of Anna and Sasha as described. Anna reverses the digits of an element, and Sasha concatenates two elements. The provided functions do not handle these operations correctly.

2. **Evaluation Criteria**: The functions `func_1` and `zerocnts` do not evaluate the game state according to the rules. They seem to be attempting to calculate something related to the number of trailing zeros in the numbers, but this is not aligned with the game's objective of determining the winner based on the remaining number after Anna's last move.

3. **No Simulation of Moves**: There is no simulation of the turns where Anna and Sasha make their respective moves. The functions do not reduce the list size as Anna's moves decrease the number of elements, and they do not handle Sasha's concatenation moves.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the game logic and thus cannot be considered correct. A correct implementation would need to simulate the turns and evaluate the final state of the list after Anna's last move.
