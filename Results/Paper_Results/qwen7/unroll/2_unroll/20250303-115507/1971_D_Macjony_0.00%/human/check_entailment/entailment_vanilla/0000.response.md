### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `count` to 1 and sets a flag `flag` to `False`. This means the initial assumption is that the entire string can be treated as one piece.
2. **Loop through the string**: The loop iterates through the string `s` from index 0 to `len(s) - 2`.
   - If the current character `s[j]` is different from the next character `s[j + 1]`, it increments the `count` by 1.
   - If the current character is '0' and the next character is '1', it sets the flag `flag` to `True` and skips the next character (`j += 1`).
3. **Adjust count based on flag**: After the loop, if the flag `flag` is `True`, it decrements the `count` by 1.
4. **Output the result**: Finally, it prints the `count`.

Let's analyze the logic:

- **Case 1: String with no cuts needed** (e.g., "00000000" or "11111111"):
  - The loop will not find any differences, so `count` remains 1, which is correct.
- **Case 2: String with cuts needed** (e.g., "11010"):
  - The loop will find the difference between '1' and '0' at index 2, incrementing `count` to 2.
  - The flag will be set to `True` when the difference is found, but since we have already incremented `count`, the final `count` will be 3, which is correct.
- **Case 3: Single character strings** (e.g., "1" or "0"):
  - The loop will not execute, and `count` will remain 1, which is correct.
- **Case 4: Strings requiring multiple cuts** (e.g., "10101010"):
  - The loop will find each difference, incrementing `count` for each difference, and the final `count` will be the number of cuts needed.

Given this analysis, the logic in the provided function correctly determines the minimum number of pieces required to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.
