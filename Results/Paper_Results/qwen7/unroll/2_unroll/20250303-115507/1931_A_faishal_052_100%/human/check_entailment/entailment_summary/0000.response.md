Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Letters**: The program attempts to calculate two numbers based on the input `n` and then sorts them. However, the logic used to determine these numbers is flawed. It incorrectly handles the ranges and does not properly convert the encoded value back into the corresponding letters.

2. **Sorting and Appending**: The program sorts the calculated numbers and appends them to a list. This approach does not ensure that the resulting word is the lexicographically smallest possible.

3. **Output Format**: The program only prints the first two numbers after conversion to characters, ignoring the third number which should be the remaining part of the encoded value.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Determine the lexicographically smallest combination of three letters that sum up to the given encoded value.
- Ensure that the solution respects the constraints of the problem and produces the correct output.

Given the above points, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
