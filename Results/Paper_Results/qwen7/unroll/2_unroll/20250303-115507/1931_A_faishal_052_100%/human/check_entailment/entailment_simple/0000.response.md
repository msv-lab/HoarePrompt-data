Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`cases`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Encoding Logic**:
   - The logic for determining the letters in the word seems flawed. Specifically, the conditions used to determine the letters do not cover all possible values of `lex` accurately.
   - The program attempts to break down `lex` into two parts, but it does not handle all possible values of `lex` properly. For instance, it incorrectly handles values of `lex` that fall between 28 and 51, and 52 and 77.
3. **Sorting and Output**:
   - After processing, the program sorts the elements in each list, which is unnecessary since the goal is to find the lexicographically smallest word.
   - The program then converts the sorted numbers back to characters using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)` and prints them.
4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For `n = 24`, the correct answer should be "aaa" (1+1+1=3, but since we need 24, the smallest lexicographical word is "aav").
   - For `n = 70`, the correct answer should be "rzz" (18+26+26=70).
   - For `n = 3`, the correct answer should be "aaa".
   - For `n = 55`, the correct answer should be "czz" (3+26+26=55).
   - For `n = 48`, the correct answer should be "auz" (1+21+26=48).

Given the above analysis, the program's logic for determining the letters from `lex` is incorrect. It does not handle all possible values of `lex` correctly and thus may produce incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
