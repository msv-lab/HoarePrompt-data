Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, it fails to generate the lexicographically smallest word for certain inputs. For instance, consider the input `n = 55`. According to the problem description, the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded is `"czz"`, but the program outputs `"azz"` instead. This happens because the program logic for determining the characters is flawed, particularly in how it handles the remaining value after the initial conditions. The program needs to ensure that it always selects the smallest possible character values first.
