You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78.

    #State: Output State: `info` is a list containing 100 lists. Each inner list contains 3 elements: two numbers between 1 and 26 (inclusive) and one number between 0 and 78 (inclusive). The last element of each inner list is derived from the initial value of `lex` after applying the specified operations, and the first two elements are the result of the operations on `lex`. All values are sorted within each inner list.
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        
        print(temp)
        
    #State: For each inner list in `info`, the output will be a string created by converting the first three integers to their corresponding lowercase letters (using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)`), concatenated together, and then printed. The fourth integer remains unchanged and is not part of the printed output.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where each case involves an integer \( n \) such that \( 3 \leq n \leq 78 \). For each case, it performs a series of operations on \( n \) and stores the results in a list. Specifically, it calculates two numbers based on \( n \) and appends them along with the modified \( n \) to a list. After processing all cases, it converts the first two numbers in each list to their corresponding lowercase letters and prints these letters as a string, while the third number is not printed. The function ultimately outputs a series of strings, each representing the processed values of \( n \) in a specific format.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, it fails to generate the lexicographically smallest word for certain inputs. For instance, consider the input `n = 55`. According to the problem description, the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded is `"czz"`, but the program outputs `"azz"` instead. This happens because the program logic for determining the characters is flawed, particularly in how it handles the remaining value after the initial conditions. The program needs to ensure that it always selects the smallest possible character values first.
