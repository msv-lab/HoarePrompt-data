### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that encodes to a given integer `n`.
   - The encoding is the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet.
   - The letters 'a' to 'z' correspond to indices 1 to 26.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`cases`) and then processes each test case.
   - It reads the encoded value `lex` for each test case.

3. **Decoding Logic:**
   - The program attempts to decode the word by breaking down the encoded value into its constituent letter positions.
   - However, there are several issues with the logic:
     - The logic for determining the first two letters is flawed. It incorrectly handles the conditions and does not always produce the smallest possible letters.
     - The final letter is directly appended without ensuring it is the smallest possible.
     - The sorting of the list `arr` does not help in finding the smallest lexicographical order.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should start from the smallest possible letters ('a', 'a', 'a') and incrementally increase the letters while maintaining the sum.
   - We can use a more systematic approach to ensure the smallest possible letters are chosen.

5. **Testing with Provided Examples:**
   - For `n = 24`, the correct answer is "aav".
   - For `n = 70`, the correct answer is "rzz".
   - For `n = 3`, the correct answer is "aaa".
   - For `n = 55`, the correct answer is "czz".
   - For `n = 48`, the correct answer is "auz".

6. **Code Analysis:**
   - The current code does not correctly handle the decoding process and does not produce the expected results for all test cases.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly decode the encoded values to produce the lexicographically smallest words.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
