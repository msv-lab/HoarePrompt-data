### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that encodes to a given integer `n`.
   - The encoding is the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet.
   - The letters 'a' to 'z' correspond to indices 1 to 26.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`cases`) and then processes each test case.
   - It reads the encoded value `lex` for each test case.

3. **Decoding Logic:**
   - The current implementation attempts to break down the encoded value into its constituent letter positions but does so in a flawed manner.
   - The logic for determining the first two letters is incorrect and does not always produce the smallest possible letters.
   - The final letter is directly appended without ensuring it is the smallest possible.
   - The sorting of the list `arr` does not help in finding the smallest lexicographical order.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should start from the smallest possible letters ('a', 'a', 'a') and incrementally increase the letters while maintaining the sum.
   - We can use a more systematic approach to ensure the smallest possible letters are chosen.

5. **Testing with Provided Examples:**
   - For `n = 24`, the correct answer is "aav".
   - For `n = 70`, the correct answer is "rzz".
   - For `n = 3`, the correct answer is "aaa".
   - For `n = 55`, the correct answer is "czz".
   - For `n = 48`, the correct answer is "auz".

6. **Code Analysis:**
   - The current code does not correctly handle the decoding process and does not produce the expected results for all test cases.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to:
- Start with the smallest possible letters ('a', 'a', 'a').
- Increment the letters while maintaining the sum.
- Ensure the letters are in lexicographical order.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Initialize the letters
        letters = ['a', 'a', 'a']
        # Convert letters to their positions
        positions = [ord(l) - 96 for l in letters]
        # Adjust the positions to match the encoded value
        while sum(positions) < lex:
            # Try to increment the last letter first
            positions[-1] += 1
            if positions[-1] > 26:
                positions[-1] = 1
                positions[-2] += 1
                if positions[-2] > 26:
                    positions[-2] = 1
                    positions[-3] += 1
        # Convert positions back to letters
        result = ''.join(chr(p + 96) for p in positions)
        print(result)

func()
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was accurate. The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded values to produce the lexicographically smallest words. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
