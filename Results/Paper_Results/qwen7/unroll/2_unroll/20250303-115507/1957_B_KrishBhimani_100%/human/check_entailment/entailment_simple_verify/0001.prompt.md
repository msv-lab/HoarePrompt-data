You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

    #State: Output State: t test cases are processed, each test case outputs two integers separated by a space. For each test case, if n is 1, the output is k itself. Otherwise, the output is a list where the first number is (2^i) - 1, the second number is k minus the first number, and it is padded with zeros to make the total length equal to n.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to construct an array of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum equals `k`, and the number of `1`s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all elements in the array is maximized.

2. **Input and Output Format**: The input consists of multiple test cases, each containing `n` and `k`. For each test case, we need to output a sequence of `n` integers that satisfy the conditions.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n == 1`, the solution is straightforward: print `k`.
   - For larger `n`, we need to maximize the number of `1`s in the bitwise OR result.

4. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided code attempts to solve the problem by:
     - Handling the case when `n == 1` directly.
     - For `n > 1`, it constructs an array with specific values to maximize the number of `1`s in the bitwise OR.
     - It uses `(1 << i) - 1` to generate a number with all bits set to `1` up to a certain bit position `i`.
     - It then calculates the remaining value needed to reach `k` and appends zeros to complete the array.

5. **Issues in the Code**:
   - The logic for constructing the array is flawed. Specifically, the use of `(1 << i) - 1` and appending `k - sum(ans)` might not always produce the optimal solution.
   - The approach does not guarantee that the bitwise OR will have the maximum number of `1`s. For example, consider `n=2` and `k=3`. The code would output `[2, 1]`, but `[1, 2]` would yield a better result with more `1`s in the bitwise OR.
   - The code does not handle the general case effectively, especially when `k` is small compared to `n`.

6. **Correct Approach**:
   - A better approach would involve distributing the value `k` among the `n` elements in a way that maximizes the number of `1`s in the bitwise OR.
   - One effective strategy is to use as many `1`s as possible in the binary representation of the elements, ensuring that the sum constraint is met.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure the maximum number of `1`s in the bitwise OR. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
