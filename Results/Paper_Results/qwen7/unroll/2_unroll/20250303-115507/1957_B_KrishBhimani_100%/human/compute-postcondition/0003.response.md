Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs (t, n, k) where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, each test case contains two integers n and k with 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the total sum of all n values does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. The function returns a value based on the relationship between n and k for each test case.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing integers n and k, and returns a value (not specified in the given information) for each test case based on the relationship between n and k.
