#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two strings `x` and `y` as input, where both strings represent integers of the same length consisting of digits from 1 to 9. It then compares the characters of these strings at each position. If a character in `x` is less than the corresponding character in `y`, it swaps them. This process continues until the end of the strings. After processing, it prints the modified list `a` (which is initially a copy of `x`) and the original list `b`. The function does not return anything.
