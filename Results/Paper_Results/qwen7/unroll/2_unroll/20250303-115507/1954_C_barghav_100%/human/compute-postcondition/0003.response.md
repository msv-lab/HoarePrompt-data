Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `a`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is the loop counter, which starts from 0 in a typical `range(len(a))` loop.
   - `a` is a list containing the characters of the input string.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `a`. Therefore, `i` should be initialized to 0 and `a` should be a non-empty list.

4. **Adjust the given states**:
   - `f` is 0, but this variable is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `x` is a string representing an integer, but this is not part of the loop head either.
   - `y` is a string representing an integer, but this is also not part of the loop head.
   - `a` is a list containing the characters of the input string, and it must be a non-empty list for the loop to execute.
   - `i` should be initialized to 0 for the loop to start.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `a` must be a non-empty list.
- `i` must be 0.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0**.
