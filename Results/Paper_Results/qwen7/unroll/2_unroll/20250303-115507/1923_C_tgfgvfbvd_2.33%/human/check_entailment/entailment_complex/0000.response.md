Reasoning:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" according to the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Problem Definition**: A subarray is considered "good" if there exists another array \( b \) of the same length where:
   - The sums of the elements in both arrays are equal.
   - No element in \( b \) is equal to the corresponding element in \( a \).
   - All elements in \( b \) are positive.

2. **Current Solution Logic**: The current solution checks if the sum of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray. This is not sufficient to determine if the subarray is "good". It only checks if the sum is large enough but does not ensure the existence of a valid \( b \) array.

3. **Correct Approach**: To determine if a subarray is "good", we need to check if we can construct a subarray \( b \) such that:
   - The sum of \( b \) equals the sum of the subarray.
   - No element in \( b \) is equal to the corresponding element in the subarray.
   - All elements in \( b \) are positive.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, constructing such a \( b \) array directly is complex and typically requires more sophisticated algorithms like dynamic programming or graph theory approaches, which are not implemented in the current solution.

Therefore, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
