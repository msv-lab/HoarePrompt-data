Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining whether a subarray is "good" based on specific conditions.
- A subarray is considered "good" if the sum of its elements is at least twice the length of the subarray.
- The provided code correctly calculates the prefix sums of the array `c` and then checks the sum of each queried subarray against the required condition.
- The logic in the code is sound: it computes the prefix sums and then for each query, it calculates the sum of the specified subarray using the prefix sums and checks if the sum is at least twice the length of the subarray.
- The code handles multiple test cases and multiple queries per test case as required by the problem statement.
- There are no apparent logical errors or omissions in the code that would lead to incorrect results.

Correctness: **True**
