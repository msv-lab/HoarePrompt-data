The function processes multiple test cases, each involving an array `c` of positive integers. For each test case, it handles a series of queries. Each query specifies a subarray of `c` defined by indices `a` and `b`. The function calculates the sum of the elements in this subarray and checks if the sum is at least twice the length of the subarray. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This process is repeated for all queries in each test case.
