You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = []
        c = 0
        for x in l:
            c += x
            p.append(c)
        for _ in range(m):
            (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
            s = p[b - 1]
            if a - 2 >= 0:
                s -= p[a - 2]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each involving an array `c` of positive integers. For each test case, it handles a series of queries. Each query specifies a subarray of `c` defined by indices `a` and `b`. The function calculates the sum of the elements in this subarray and checks if the sum is at least twice the length of the subarray. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This process is repeated for all queries in each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is good according to the problem description. Specifically, the program checks if the sum of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray, which is not sufficient to guarantee that the subarray is good. 

To be good, a subarray must satisfy three conditions:
1. The sum of the elements in the subarray must be equal to the sum of the corresponding elements in another array \( b \).
2. No element in the subarray can be equal to the corresponding element in \( b \).
3. All elements in \( b \) must be positive.

The program only checks the sum condition and does not ensure that the subarray can be transformed into another array \( b \) that satisfies all three conditions. For example, consider the subarray \([1, 2, 1]\):

- The sum of the subarray is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\).
- The length of the subarray is 3.
- The sum condition \(4 \geq 2 \times 3\) is satisfied, so the program would incorrectly print 'YES'.

However, it is impossible to find an array \( b \) such that the subarray \([1, 2, 1]\) can be transformed into \( b \) while satisfying all three conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
