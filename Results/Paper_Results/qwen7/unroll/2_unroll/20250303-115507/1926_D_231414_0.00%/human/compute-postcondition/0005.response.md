Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it takes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), and a list of n non-negative integers a (0 ≤ a_j < 2^31 for all 1 ≤ j ≤ n). The function returns a result based on the input for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer `t`, another positive integer `n`, and a list of `n` non-negative integers. For each test case, the function processes these inputs and returns a specific result, though the exact nature of the result is not specified in the given information.
