Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand.
   
2. **Counting Card Occurrences:**
   - The program initializes a count array `cnt` of size `n+1` to keep track of how many times each card value appears among the cards in your hand.
   - It then iterates through the list `a` and increments the corresponding index in `cnt` for each card value.

3. **Calculating Maximum Points:**
   - The program iterates through the count array `cnt` and calculates the maximum points you can get.
   - For each card value `x`, it adds `max(0, x - 1)` to `ans`. This means that if a card value `x` appears more than once in your hand, you can ensure at least one point by playing one of those cards.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated maximum points `ans` for each test case.

### Reasoning:

- **Correctness of Counting:**
  - The counting logic correctly counts the occurrences of each card value in your hand.

- **Optimal Strategy:**
  - The strategy of adding `max(0, x - 1)` ensures that for any card value `x` that appears more than once, you can guarantee at least one point by playing one of those cards. This aligns with the problem statement where Nene will always play optimally to minimize your score.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where a card value might appear only once, resulting in `max(0, x - 1) == 0`.

- **Overall Logic:**
  - The logic correctly reflects the optimal strategy for maximizing your score while considering Nene's optimal play to minimize your score.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
