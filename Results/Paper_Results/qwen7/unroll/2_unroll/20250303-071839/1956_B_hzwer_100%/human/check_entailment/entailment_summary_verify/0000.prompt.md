You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You and Nene are playing a card game. The deck with 2n cards is used to play
this game. Each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, and each of integers 1
through n appears exactly on 2 cards. Additionally, there is a table where
cards are placed during the game (initially, the table is empty).

In the beginning of the game, these 2n cards are distributed between you and
Nene so that each player receives n cards.

After it, you and Nene alternatively take 2n turns, i.e. each person takes n
turns, starting with you. On each turn:

  * The player whose turn is it selects one of the cards in his hand. Let x be the number on it. 
  * The player whose turn is it receives 1 point if there is already a card with the integer x on the table (otherwise, he receives no points). After it, he places the selected card with the integer x on the table. 

Note that turns are made publicly: each player can see all the cards on the
table at each moment.

Nene is very smart so she always selects cards optimally in order to maximize
her score in the end of the game (after 2n rounds). If she has several optimal
moves, she selects the move that minimizes your score in the end of the game.

More formally, Nene always takes turns optimally in order to maximize her
score in the end of the game in the first place and to minimize your score in
the end of the game in the second place.

Assuming that the cards are already distributed and cards in your hand have
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n written on them, what is the maximum number of
points you can get by taking your turns optimally?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) —
the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer
from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n at most 2
times.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer: the maximum number of points you can
get.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    1 1 2 3
    
    8
    
    7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5
    
    8
    
    7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6
    
    3
    
    1 2 3
    
    1
    
    1

Output

    1
    2
    1
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, the integers written on your cards are 1 , 1 , 2 and 3
. The integers written on Nene's cards are 2 , 3 , 4 and 4 . The game may
proceed as follows:

  1. You select one of the cards with an integer 1 written on it and place it on the table. 
  2. Nene selects one of the cards with an integer 4 written on it and places it on the table. 
  3. You select the card with an integer 1 written on it, receive 1 point, and place the selected card on the table. 
  4. Nene selects the card with an integer 4 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  5. You select the card with an integer 2 written on it and place it on the table. 
  6. Nene selects the card with an integer 2 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  7. You select the card with an integer 3 written on it and place it on the table. 
  8. Nene selects the card with an integer 3 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 

At the end of the game, you scored 1 point, and Nene scored 3 . It can be
shown that you cannot score more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally, so the
answer is 1 .

In the second test case, if both players play optimally, you score 2 points
and Nene scores 6 points.

- Program:
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = [0] * (n + 1)
        for x in a:
            cnt[x] += 1
        ans = 0
        for x in cnt:
            ans += max(0, x - 1)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of inputs, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list of integers \( a \), where each integer from 1 to \( n \) appears at most twice. For each input, it counts the occurrences of each integer in the list \( a \) and calculates the sum of the maximum values of 0 and \( x-1 \) for each count \( x \). Finally, it prints the calculated sum for each input.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the scenario where there are duplicate cards in your hand correctly. According to the problem description, each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice among the 2n cards. However, the program calculates the maximum points you can get by assuming each integer appears at most once in your hand. This leads to an incorrect result when there are duplicates.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
2 2 1 1
```

In this case, you have two cards with the number 1 and two cards with the number 2. If you play optimally, you should be able to get 2 points because you can pair each of the numbers 1 and 2 with a card on the table. However, the program will only calculate `max(0, 2-1) + max(0, 2-1) = 2`, which is correct in this specific case but does not account for the possibility of getting more points if there are multiple pairs.

To fix this, the program needs to consider the possibility of having multiple pairs of the same number. Specifically, for each unique number in your hand, if it appears more than once, you can potentially get an additional point by pairing it with another card of the same number before Nene can block it.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = [0] * (n + 1)
        for x in a:
            cnt[x] += 1
        
        ans = 0
        for x in range(1, n + 1):
            if cnt[x] > 1:
                # You can get 1 point for each pair of the same number
                ans += cnt[x] // 2
            else:
                # If there is only one card of this number, Nene can block it
                ans += max(0, cnt[x] - 1)
        
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that you account for the possibility of having multiple pairs of the same number, leading to a more accurate calculation of the maximum points you can get.
