### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
   
2. **Non-Decreasing Check**: It first checks if the array `a` is already non-decreasing using the condition `check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`. If this condition is true, the function prints 'YES' immediately, as no swaps are needed.

3. **Finding Potential Swap Points**: If the array is not non-decreasing, it iterates through the array to find the first point where the sequence breaks (`a[i-1] > a[i]`). This is done with the loop `for i in range(1, n)`.

4. **Checking New Array After Swap**: For the found index `i`, it splits the array into two parts: `new = a[i:]` (suffix) and the remaining part (prefix). It then checks two conditions:
   - `check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])`: This checks if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to every element in the suffix.
   - `new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])`: This checks if the suffix itself is non-decreasing.

5. **Decision Making**: If both conditions are satisfied, it means the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping the suffix and the prefix. Hence, it prints 'YES'. If either condition fails, it prints 'NO'.

### Analysis:
The logic in the program correctly identifies if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping. The initial check ensures that if the array is already non-decreasing, it returns 'YES'. The subsequent checks ensure that the array can be rearranged by finding a suitable split point and verifying the conditions.

### Conclusion:
Given the problem description and the provided examples, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by the specified operations.

**Correctness: True**
