Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Check for Sorted Array:**
   - The `check_all` variable checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, but this is not sufficient. The problem requires checking if the array can be made sorted by splitting and swapping parts.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting and Swapping:**
   - The code attempts to split the array at every possible position and checks if the resulting array is sorted. However, it only checks if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to the elements of the new subarray (`check_all_new`). This is not a comprehensive check for the entire array being sorted.
   - The code should ensure that after swapping, the entire array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Correct Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))

        # Check if the array is already sorted
        if all(a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)):
            print('YES')
            continue

        # Try to find a valid split point
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                # Check if the suffix part is sorted
                if all(a[i + j] >= a[j] for j in range(i, n)):
                    # Check if the prefix part is sorted
                    if all(a[j] <= a[j + 1] for j in range(n - i - 1)):
                        print('YES')
                        break
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This solution correctly checks if the array can be made sorted by finding a valid split point and ensuring both parts are sorted.
