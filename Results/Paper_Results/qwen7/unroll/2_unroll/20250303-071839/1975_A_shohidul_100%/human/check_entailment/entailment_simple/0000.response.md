Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
3. It checks if the array `a` is already non-decreasing using `check_all = all([(a[i - 1] <= a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])`. If this condition is true, it prints "YES".
4. If the array is not non-decreasing, it iterates through possible splits of the array and checks if the first part is non-decreasing and the second part is non-increasing (`check_all_new` and `new_all`).
5. If such a split exists, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic appears to be correctly implemented to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts. The conditions and checks seem to cover the necessary cases.

Correctness: **True**
