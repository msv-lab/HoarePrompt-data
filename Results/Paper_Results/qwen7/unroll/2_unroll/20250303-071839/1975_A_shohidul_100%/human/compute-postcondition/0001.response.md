Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: According to the problem, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an integer input, it will always be greater than or equal to 1 (as per the given constraint).

4. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Given the constraints, `t` will always be at least 1, but to explicitly state the requirement, we need to ensure `t > 0`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t` must be greater than 0.

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
