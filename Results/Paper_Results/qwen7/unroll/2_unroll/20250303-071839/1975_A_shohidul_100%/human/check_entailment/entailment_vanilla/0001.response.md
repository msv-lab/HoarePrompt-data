Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array and the array itself.
   
2. **Checking if the Array is Already Sorted:**
   - The program uses `check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])` to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is already sorted, it prints 'YES'.

3. **Handling Unsorted Arrays:**
   - If the array is not sorted, the program iterates through possible splits of the array.
   - For each split at index `i`, it checks:
     - Whether the prefix `[a[0], ..., a[i-1]]` is greater than or equal to the suffix `[a[i], ..., a[n-1]]` at the start.
     - Whether the suffix is sorted.
   - If such a split exists where the conditions are met, it prints 'YES'.
   - If no such split exists, it prints 'NO'.

### Verification Against Test Cases

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `1 1 4 5 1 4`
   - The array is not sorted, and there is no way to split it such that the resulting array becomes sorted. Therefore, the output should be 'NO'.
   - The program correctly identifies this and outputs 'NO'.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `7 9 2 2 3`
   - The array can be split into `[7]` and `[9, 2, 2, 3]`, and then swapped to get `[9, 2, 2, 3, 7]`, which is sorted. Therefore, the output should be 'YES'.
   - The program correctly identifies this and outputs 'YES'.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `1 2 3`
   - The array is already sorted. Therefore, the output should be 'YES'.
   - The program correctly identifies this and outputs 'YES'.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the test cases provided in the problem statement. It accurately determines whether the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts of the array.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
