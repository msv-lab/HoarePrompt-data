Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`. This part is correct.

2. **Sum of Friendship Values Calculation**: The program calculates the sum of friendship values (`sum_f`) for all given pairs of friends. This is done correctly.

3. **Combinatorial Calculations**:
   - The program calculates `cn2` which is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n`, i.e., \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n \times (n-1)}{2} \). This calculation is correct.
   - The formula used for `p` and `q` seems to be derived from the expected value calculation. Specifically, `p` represents the numerator of the expected value, and `q` represents the denominator. The formulas used for `p` and `q` are:
     \[
     p = 2 \times k \times cn2 \times sum_f + m \times k \times (k - 1)
     \]
     \[
     q = 2 \times cn2^2
     \]
   - The GCD calculation and simplification of `p` and `q` are correct, ensuring that the fraction is in its simplest form.

4. **Modular Inverse Calculation**: The program correctly computes the modular inverse of `q` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) using `pow(q, -1, M)`. This is a standard method to find the modular inverse when the modulus is prime.

5. **Final Output**: The program prints the result of the expression `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)` for each test case, which is the required output format.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow the correct logic and calculations as per the problem statement. There are no apparent errors in the logic or the implementation.

Correctness: **True**
