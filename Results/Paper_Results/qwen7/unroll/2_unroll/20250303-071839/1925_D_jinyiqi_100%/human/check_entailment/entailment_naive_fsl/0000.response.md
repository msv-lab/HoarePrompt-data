Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the numerator `p` and the denominator `q` without considering the probability of choosing each pair of friends.

The program calculates `p` and `q` as follows:
- `p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`
- `q = 2 * cn2 ** 2`

However, the correct approach involves calculating the expected value based on the probability of choosing each pair of friends. The expected value for each excursion is the sum of the friendship values of the chosen pairs, weighted by their probabilities.

A correct solution would involve:
1. Calculating the probability of choosing each pair of friends.
2. Using these probabilities to compute the expected value for each excursion.
3. Summing up the expected values for all k excursions.

Here's a brief outline of how the correct solution should work:
- For each pair of friends, calculate the probability of being chosen in a single excursion.
- Use these probabilities to compute the expected value for each excursion.
- Sum up the expected values for all k excursions.

The given program does not account for these probabilities and directly uses the friendship values and counts, which leads to incorrect results.
