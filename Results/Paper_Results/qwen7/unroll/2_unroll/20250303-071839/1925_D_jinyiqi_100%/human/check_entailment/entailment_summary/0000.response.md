Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Friendship Value Calculation**: For each test case, it correctly sums up the friendship values `sum_f` from the given pairs.
3. **Combination Calculation**: The variable `cn2` is calculated as the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n`, which is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
4. **Expression Calculation**: The program calculates `p` and `q` using the formula:
   \[
   p = 2 \times k \times \text{cn2} \times \text{sum\_f} + m \times k \times (k - 1)
   \]
   \[
   q = 2 \times (\text{cn2})^2
   \]
5. **GCD Calculation**: The greatest common divisor (gcd) of `p` and `q` is computed to simplify the fraction.
6. **Final Output**: The program computes \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\), which is the required output format.

Given the problem statement and the provided example, the program appears to follow the correct mathematical formulation and handles the constraints appropriately. The logic seems sound and aligns with the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
