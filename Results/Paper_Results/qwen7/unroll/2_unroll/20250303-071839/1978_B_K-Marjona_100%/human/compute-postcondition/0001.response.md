Output State: The output state consists of multiple lines, where each line corresponds to the output of one test case. For each test case, if \(b \leq a\), the output is \(a \times n\). Otherwise, the output is \(b \times k - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a\), with \(k = \min(n, b - a)\).

This means for each test case, the output will either be a simple multiplication result or a more complex calculation involving the minimum value between \(n\) and \(b - a\), followed by arithmetic operations.
