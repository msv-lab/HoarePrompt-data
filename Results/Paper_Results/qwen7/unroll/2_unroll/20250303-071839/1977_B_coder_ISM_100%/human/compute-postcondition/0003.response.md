Output State: t lines, each line containing an integer (which is the new length of the list `s` after processing) followed by a sequence of characters ('0', '1', or '-1') representing the processed binary representation of the input number. The processing rules transform the binary representation according to specific conditions and update the length of the list accordingly.
