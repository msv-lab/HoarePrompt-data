You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

Example

    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1
    6
    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

    #State: Output State: t lines, each line containing an integer (which is the new length of the list `s` after processing) followed by a sequence of characters ('0', '1', or '-1') representing the processed binary representation of the input number. The processing rules transform the binary representation according to specific conditions and update the length of the list accordingly.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a positive integer \( t \) (number of test cases) and another positive integer \( x \) (within the range 1 to \( 2^{30} - 1 \)). For each test case, it converts \( x \) into its 30-bit binary representation, applies a series of transformations based on specific conditions, and outputs the new length of the binary representation along with the transformed binary string. The transformations include flipping bits under certain conditions and adjusting the length of the binary string accordingly. After processing all test cases, the function prints the results for each test case, showing the updated length and the modified binary string.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - The program constructs a binary representation of `x` using a list `s`.
   - It iterates from `0` to `29` (since `2^30` is the upper limit), checking if the `i-th` bit of `x` is set (`1`) or not (`0`).
   - This part is correct and ensures that the binary representation of `x` is stored in `s`.

3. **Adjusting for Constraints:**
   - The program then iterates through the bits of `s` to ensure no two consecutive non-zero bits exist.
   - If a `1` is found, it checks if the next bit is also `1`. If so, it changes the current bit to `-1` and sets a flag.
   - If the flag is set and the current bit is `0`, it changes the current bit to `1`.
   - These adjustments are designed to ensure no two consecutive non-zero bits exist, which is correct.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where the last bit might need adjustment and ensures the final result meets the constraints.
   - If the last bit is `0` and the flag is set, it changes the last bit to `1` and increments the length.
   - If the flag is still set, it appends a `1` to the end of the list and increments the length.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the resulting list `s` and then prints the list itself.
   - This output format matches the required format specified in the problem statement.

### Verification

Given the problem constraints and the steps outlined above, the program appears to correctly generate an array `a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}` that satisfies all the conditions mentioned in the problem statement.

### Conclusion

The program logic is sound and adheres to the problem requirements. Therefore, the given program is correct.
