Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a positive integer \( t \) (number of test cases) and another positive integer \( x \) (within the range 1 to \( 2^{30} - 1 \)). For each test case, it converts \( x \) into its 30-bit binary representation, applies a series of transformations based on specific conditions, and outputs the new length of the binary representation along with the transformed binary string. The transformations include flipping bits under certain conditions and adjusting the length of the binary string accordingly. After processing all test cases, the function prints the results for each test case, showing the updated length and the modified binary string.**
