Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. The program takes an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
2. It then iterates over each test case, reading a string of length 5.
3. For each string, it counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'.
4. It compares the counts and prints the character ('A' or 'B') that appears more frequently.
5. The program handles all given constraints and examples correctly.

Given this analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
