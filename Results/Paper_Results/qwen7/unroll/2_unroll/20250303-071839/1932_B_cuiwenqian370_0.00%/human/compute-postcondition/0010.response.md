Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `n` (an integer representing the number of signs for each test case), and `path` (a string containing `n` space-separated integers representing the periodicities of the signs for each test case). It returns different outputs based on the conditions specified in the problem statement.**

This means the function `func_2` takes in the number of test cases (`t`), the number of signs for each test case (`n`), and a string (`path`) that contains `n` space-separated integers representing the periodicities of the signs for each test case. The function then processes these inputs according to the specified conditions and returns the appropriate output for each test case.
