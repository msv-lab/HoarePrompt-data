### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are unrelated to the problem description. The problem requires calculating the year in which all signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially based on their periodicities. However, the given functions instead deal with a different problem involving paths containing `@` and `*` characters.

Let's break down the annotated code to understand why the original assessment is accurate:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function takes a string `path` as input, which consists of `@` and `*` characters.
   - It initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` to store intermediate results.
   - The function calculates values in `dp` based on the characters in `path`. Specifically:
     - If the first character is `@`, `dp[0]` is set to 1.
     - If the first character is `*`, `dp[0]` is set to -infinity.
     - Subsequent elements in `dp` are calculated based on the characters in `path`. If a character is `*`, the corresponding `dp` element is set to -infinity. Otherwise, it is the maximum of the previous two elements in `dp` plus 1 if the character is `@`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes it, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It splits the input string into a list of strings and extracts the necessary information.
   - It then calls `func_1` for each test case and appends the results to a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints the results.

Given the problem description, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not perform the required calculations to determine the year when all signs of the apocalypse will occur. They are solving a different problem entirely.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate. The program is indeed incorrect for the given problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program does not solve the problem as described in the problem statement.
