Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, `n` is the length of `path`, and `dp` is a list of `n` zeros. The length of `path` is greater than 1, and the second character of `path` is not '*', so the first element of `dp` is either 1 (if the first character of `path` is '@') or 0 (if the first character of `path` is '*').
