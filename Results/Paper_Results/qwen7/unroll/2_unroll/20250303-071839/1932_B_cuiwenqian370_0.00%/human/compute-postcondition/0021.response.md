Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, `n` is the length of `path`, and `dp` is a list of `n` zeros. The first character of `path` is checked, and if it is '@', the first element of `dp` is set to 1. If it is '*', the first element of `dp` is set to -inf. Otherwise, the first element of `dp` remains 0. The second character of `path` is '*', and the first element of `dp` reflects the corresponding value based on the first character of `path`. The length of `path` is greater than 1.
