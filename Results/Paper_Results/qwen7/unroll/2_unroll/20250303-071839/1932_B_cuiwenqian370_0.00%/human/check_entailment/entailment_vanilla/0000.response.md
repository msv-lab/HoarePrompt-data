Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the year when all signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially. This involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities of the signs.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The code provided includes two functions (`func_1` and `func_2`). However, these functions do not match the requirements of the problem.
   - `func_1` seems to be designed to process some kind of path or sequence represented by characters (`@` and `*`), but this is unrelated to the problem of calculating the year for the apocalypse.
   - `func_2` reads input and calls `func_1` with what appears to be a string of characters, not integers representing periodicities.

3. **Expected Solution**:
   - The solution should involve calculating the LCM of the periodicities for each test case.
   - The LCM can be calculated iteratively using the formula `lcm(a, b) = abs(a*b) // gcd(a, b)` where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
