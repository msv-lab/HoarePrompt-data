### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are unrelated to the problem description. Let's break down the problem and the provided code to understand why the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description:
The problem requires calculating the year in which all \( n \) signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially. This means we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \), because the LCM will give us the smallest year in which all signs will occur simultaneously.

#### Provided Code:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function seems to be designed to process a string with characters `@` and `*`. It calculates some value based on these characters using dynamic programming.
   - The function does not relate to the periodicities of the signs or finding the LCM.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - Again, it does not perform any calculation related to the periodicities of the signs or finding the LCM.

Given that both functions are unrelated to the problem, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect for the given problem description.
