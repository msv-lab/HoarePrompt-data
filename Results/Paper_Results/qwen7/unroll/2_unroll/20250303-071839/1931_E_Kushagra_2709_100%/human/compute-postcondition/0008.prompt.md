You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of integers in the list, m is an integer representing the parameter determining when Sasha wins, and nums is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
def func_1(n, m, nums):
    tot = sum(len(val) for val in map(str, nums))
    cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)
    for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2):
        tot -= cntvals[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `cntvals` is a list of the sorted counts of zeros in each integer of `nums`, excluding every second count in descending order; `tot` is the sum of the lengths of the string representations of each integer in `nums` minus the counts at even indices; `n` is an integer representing the number of integers in the list; `m` is an integer representing the parameter determining when Sasha wins; `nums` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
    return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'
    #The program returns 'Sasha' if the sum of the lengths of the string representations of each integer in `nums` minus the counts at even indices is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, otherwise it returns 'Anna'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n`, which is an integer representing the number of integers in the list `nums`; `m`, which is an integer representing the parameter determining when Sasha wins; and `nums`, which is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. It returns 'Sasha' if the sum of the lengths of the string representations of each integer in `nums` minus the counts at even indices is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, otherwise it returns 'Anna'.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns 'Sasha' if the sum of the lengths of the string representations of each integer in `nums` minus the counts at even indices is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, otherwise it returns 'Anna'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
