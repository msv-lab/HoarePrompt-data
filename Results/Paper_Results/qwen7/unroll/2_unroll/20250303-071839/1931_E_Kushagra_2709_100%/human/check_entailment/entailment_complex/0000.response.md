Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function calculates a score (`tot`) based on the lengths of the numbers in the list and the number of trailing zeros in those numbers.
   - It sums up the lengths of the string representations of each number in `nums`.
   - It then subtracts the counts of trailing zeros at even indices from this sum.
   - If the resulting `tot` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, it returns 'Sasha'. Otherwise, it returns 'Anna'.
   
2. **Function `zerocnts` Analysis**:
   - This function counts the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of a given number `num`.
   - It iterates over the string representation of `num` from the end to the beginning, counting the zeros until it encounters a non-zero digit.
   - It returns the count of trailing zeros.

3. **Game Logic**:
   - The game alternates between Anna and Sasha.
   - Anna reverses the digits of an element.
   - Sasha concatenates two elements.
   - The game ends when Sasha can no longer make a move, and the final number is checked against `10^m`.

4. **Winning Condition**:
   - Sasha wins if the final number is greater than or equal to `10^m`.
   - Anna wins otherwise.

5. **Score Calculation**:
   - The score `tot` calculated in `func_1` seems to be a simplified way to determine the outcome of the game.
   - The logic behind subtracting the counts of trailing zeros at even indices might be related to the optimal strategy for Sasha to ensure the final number is large enough to win.

6. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
   - The `zerocnts` function accurately counts trailing zeros.
   - The `func_1` function correctly calculates the score and determines the winner based on the score relative to `m + 1`.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
