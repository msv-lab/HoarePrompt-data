Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):`. This means the loop variable `i` is being initialized and updated within this range.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being set to `len(num) - 1`.

3. **Understand the range**: The range is from `len(num) - 1` to `-1` (inclusive), with a step of `-1`. This means `i` will take values from `len(num) - 1` down to `0`.

4. **Identify the necessary adjustments**: Since the loop depends on the value of `i` and the length of `num`, these are the variables that need to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute.

5. **Consider the initial state of `num`**: `num` is a string representation of an integer in the range `1 ≤ num ≤ 10^9`. We need to ensure that `num` is a valid string and has a non-zero length.

6. **Final state before the loop**: Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to `len(num) - 1`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `num` and `i`.

**State:**
- `num` is a string representation of an integer in the range `1 ≤ num ≤ 10^9`.
- `i` is set to `len(num) - 1`.

So, the final answer is:
**State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer in the range 1 ≤ num ≤ 10^9, `i` is len(num) - 1**.
