Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Let's analyze why:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program calculates `ans` as `n`, which initializes the count of valid pairs.
   - It then iterates from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m` (inclusive) and increments `ans` by \((n + b) // (b * b)\). This part of the code does not correctly reflect the logic required to solve the problem.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each pair \((a, b)\), you need to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The correct approach involves iterating through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within their respective ranges and checking the condition.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(x, y):
    return math.gcd(x, y)

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    return ans

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

func()
```

This corrected version properly checks each pair \((a, b)\) to see if it meets the condition and counts the valid pairs accordingly.
