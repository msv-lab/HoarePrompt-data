Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n` and `m`.
2. **Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes `ans` to `n`. This is because the trivial solution where `a = n` and `b = 1` always satisfies the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
3. **Loop for Calculating Valid Pairs**: The loop iterates over values of `b` from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m`. For each `b`, it adds `(n + b) // (b * b)` to `ans`. This part seems to be incorrectly calculating the number of valid pairs.

The key issue here is the formula used in the loop: `(n + b) // (b * b)`. This does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. Specifically, the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) should be checked for each possible pair \((a, b)\).

To verify this, let's consider a few examples:

- For the test case `10 8`:
  - The correct answer should be 14, but the given program will not produce the correct result because of the incorrect calculation in the loop.

Given these observations, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

Correctness: **False**
