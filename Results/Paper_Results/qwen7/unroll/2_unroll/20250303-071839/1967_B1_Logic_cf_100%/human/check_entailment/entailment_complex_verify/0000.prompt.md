You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        
        ans = n
        
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t`, followed by `t` lines, each containing the result of the computation for each input pair `[n, m]`. For each pair, the result is calculated by initializing `ans` to `n`, then adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b` from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of integers \( t \), \( n \), and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates a value based on \( n \) and \( m \) using a specific formula: starting with \( ans = n \), it adds \( (n + b) // (b * b) \) for each \( b \) from 2 up to the minimum of \( n \) and \( m \). The function then prints the result for each test case, outputting \( t \) lines of results.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Specifically, the program calculates `ans` using a formula that does not accurately reflect the conditions specified in the problem statement. 

To illustrate, consider the test case `n = 10` and `m = 8`. According to the problem description, we need to count the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 \le a \le n`, `1 \le b \le m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b \cdot \gcd(a, b)`.

However, the program's logic does not properly check these conditions. Instead, it incorrectly adds a value to `ans` based on a simplified formula `(n + b) // (b * b)`, which does not account for the gcd condition or the requirement that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b \cdot \gcd(a, b)`.

For instance, for the pair `(2, 2)`, the program would incorrectly include this pair in the count, as it does not validate whether `2 + 2` is a multiple of `2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2)`. This is because the program does not explicitly compute the gcd or check the multiple condition.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is thus incorrect.
