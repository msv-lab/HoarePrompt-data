Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the value of `t` is updated to the integer input provided, while the constraints on `t` remain the same. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`) are not affected by this line of code.
