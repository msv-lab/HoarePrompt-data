You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: `t` is the final value of `t` after all iterations of the loop have executed, based on the given operations and conditions within the loop. The value of `t` is determined by the inputs `a` and `b` for each iteration of the loop, and it is updated according to the specified rules. The initial value of `t` from the precondition is modified by these operations, and the final value of `t` after all iterations is the output state.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `x` and `y` (number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively).

2. **Initial Calculation**:
   - `t = b`: This initializes `t` with the value of `b` (number of 2x2 icons).
   - If `t` is even, `t` is divided by 2. Otherwise, `t` is divided by 2 and incremented by 1. This calculation aims to determine the minimum number of 2x2 icons that can fit into the available space without overlapping.
     - This part seems correct because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and dividing by 2 gives the maximum number of non-overlapping 2x2 icons that can fit.

3. **Space Calculation**:
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`: This calculates the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, so `b * 4` accounts for the total space taken by 2x2 icons. Multiplying `t` by 15 gives the total space these icons would occupy if they were placed optimally.
     - This step seems incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that the remaining space should be calculated based on the actual grid layout (5x3).

4. **Remaining Space Filling**:
   - `if t1 >= a`: Checks if there is enough space to fit all 1x1 icons.
   - If not, it calculates how many additional screens are needed to fit the remaining 1x1 icons.
     - The logic here is flawed. The remaining space should be recalculated based on the actual grid layout, not just the difference between `t1` and `a`.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - The program prints the final number of screens needed, which is stored in `t`.

### Example Analysis

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

- **Test Case 1**: `1 1`
  - `t = 1`, `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`. Since `11 >= 1`, `t = 1`.
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2**: `7 2`
  - `t = 2`, `t1 = 2 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 22`. Since `22 >= 7`, `t = 1`.
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3**: `12 4`
  - `t = 4`, `t1 = 4 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 44`. Since `44 >= 12`, `t = 1`.
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4**: `0 3`
  - `t = 3`, `t1 = 3 * 15 - 3 * 4 = 33`. Since `33 < 0`, `t2 = 0 - 33 = -33`, and `t = 1 + -33 // 15 + 1 = 1 + (-2) + 1 = 0`.
  - Output: `0` (Incorrect, should be `2`)

- **Test Case 5**: `1 0`
  - `t = 0`, `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`. Since `0 >= 1`, `t = 1`.
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 6**: `8 1`
  - `t = 1`, `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`. Since `11 >= 8`, `t = 1`.
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 7**: `0 0`
  - `t = 0`, `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`. Since `0 >= 0`, `t = 0`.
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Test Case 8**: `2 0`
  - `t = 0`, `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`. Since `0 >= 2`, `t = 1`.
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 9**: `15 0`
  - `t = 0`, `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`. Since `0 >= 15`, `t = 1`.
  - Output: `1` (Incorrect, should be `3`)

- **Test Case 10**: `8 2`
  - `t = 2`, `t1 = 2 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 22`. Since `22 >= 8`, `t = 1`.
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 11**: `0 9`
  - `t = 9`, `t1 = 9 * 15 - 9 * 4 = 99`. Since `99 >= 0`, `t = 1`.
  - Output: `1` (Incorrect, should be `3`)

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly calculate the number of screens needed. The space calculations and the logic for determining the number of additional screens are flawed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
