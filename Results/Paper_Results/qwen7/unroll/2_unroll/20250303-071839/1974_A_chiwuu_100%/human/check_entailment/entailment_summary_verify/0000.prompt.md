You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b
        if t % 2 == 0:
            t = t // 2
        else:
            t = t // 2 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two non-negative integers \(x\) and \(y\), and a positive integer \(t\) (where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)). For each test case, it calculates a final value of \(t\) based on specific operations involving \(x\) and \(y\). The function updates \(t\) according to predefined rules and prints the final value of \(t\) for each test case. The overall effect is to transform the initial value of \(t\) into a new value based on the given inputs and conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place the icons. Specifically, the logic to determine the number of screens required is flawed. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the input `x = 10` and `y = 1`. According to the problem description, we need to fit 10 icons of size 1x1 and 1 icon of size 2x2. Each screen can hold up to 15 icons (5 rows * 3 columns). The 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, leaving 11 cells available for 1x1 icons. Since 10 <= 11, we can fit all the 1x1 icons on the same screen as the 2x2 icon. Therefore, the minimum number of screens needed is 1.

However, the program calculates the number of screens as follows:
1. It calculates `t = b` (where `b` is the number of 2x2 icons).
2. It checks if `t` is even or odd and adjusts accordingly.
3. It calculates `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`.
4. It checks if `t1 >= a` and adjusts the number of screens accordingly.

This logic does not correctly handle the case where the number of 1x1 icons exceeds the available space after placing the 2x2 icon. For the given example, the program would incorrectly calculate the number of screens needed.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly account for the space taken by the 2x2 icon and ensure that the remaining space can accommodate the 1x1 icons.
