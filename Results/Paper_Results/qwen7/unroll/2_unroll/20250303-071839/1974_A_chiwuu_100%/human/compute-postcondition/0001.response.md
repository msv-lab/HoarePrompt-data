Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the objects in the loop head: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. Determine the initial state of these objects:
   - `i` is not explicitly initialized in the loop head, but it will start from 0 (the default value for `range(n)`).
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. Determine the condition for the loop to execute:
   - The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0.

4. Adjust the state based on the loop condition:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop increments `i`, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

5. Consider the initial state given:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

6. Combine the information:
   - The state of `t` does not affect the loop execution directly, so it does not need to be adjusted.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
