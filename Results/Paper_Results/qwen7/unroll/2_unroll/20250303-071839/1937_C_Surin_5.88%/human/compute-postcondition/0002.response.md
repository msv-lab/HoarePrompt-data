Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `kp` which is initialized by `range(int(input()))`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `kp` is within the range specified by `int(input())`.

3. **Determine the Initial State**: 
   - The lambda function `R` is defined to take an integer input.
   - The existence of the secret permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) is maintained.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The loop will start when `kp` is set to the first value in the range, which is `0`.
   - The input to `int(input())` will determine the upper limit of the range.
   - Since the loop will execute as long as `kp` is less than this upper limit, the initial state of `kp` should be `0`, and the input value should be valid (i.e., a positive integer).

5. **Formulate the Final State**:
   - `kp` must be `0` initially.
   - The input value must be a positive integer to ensure the loop can execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`kp` is 0, the input value must be a positive integer**.
