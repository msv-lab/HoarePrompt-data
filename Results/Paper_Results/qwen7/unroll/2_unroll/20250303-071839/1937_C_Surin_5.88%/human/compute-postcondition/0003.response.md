Output State: The output state will consist of two main parts. First, for each iteration of `kp`, the loop will determine the relative order of elements based on the comparison results (`<` or `>`). Second, it will output the final pair of indices `! {prev} {v1}` which represents the sorted positions of the elements according to the secret permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \).

In more detail, for each value of `n`, the loop will compare pairs of elements to establish their relative order. After completing these comparisons, it will determine the correct position of `v1` and another element `prev` in the sorted sequence. The final output for each `n` will show the sorted positions of these two elements.
