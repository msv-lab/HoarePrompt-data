Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `edges` is an empty list, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n.**

Explanation: The code initializes `edges` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, or `start`. The values of `n` and `t` are updated to the integer inputs from the user, while `start` remains unchanged. Therefore, `edges` is now an empty list.
