Output State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is still an empty list, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `empty` is still True, `nodes` is a defaultdict where all values are now lists containing the neighbors of each node based on the input edges.

This means that after the loop executes, the `nodes` defaultdict will contain the adjacency list representation of a graph with `n` nodes. Each key in `nodes` corresponds to a node, and the value associated with each key is a list of its neighboring nodes. The `edges` list remains empty as it was not affected by the loop, and the other variables (`t`, `empty`, and `start`) remain unchanged.
