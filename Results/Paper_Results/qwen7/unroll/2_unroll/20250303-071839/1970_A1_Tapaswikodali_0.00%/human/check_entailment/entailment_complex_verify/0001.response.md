### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Balance Calculation:**
   - The program correctly reads the input string `s` and iterates through each character.
   - It calculates the balance of the parentheses sequence by incrementing the balance for an opening parenthesis `(` and decrementing it for a closing parenthesis `)`. This part is correct.

2. **Details List Construction:**
   - For each character, the program appends a tuple `(balance, -i, char)` to the `details` list.
   - Using `-i` ensures that when sorting by balance, characters with the same balance will be sorted in decreasing order of their original positions. This is correct.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The `details` list is sorted based on the balance values in ascending order and positions in descending order.
   - Sorting by balance first ensures that the prefixes' balances are correctly ordered, and the secondary sorting by position ensures that sequences with the same balance are ordered from right to left in the original string. This is correct.

4. **Result Construction:**
   - The program constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `details` list. However, there is a small issue here. The `details` list is sorted with the balance values in ascending order, but the characters should be joined in the reverse order of their positions (from left to right in the original string). The current implementation joins the characters in the order they appear in the sorted `details` list, which might not produce the correct result.

5. **Output:**
   - The result string is printed, which should be the balanced shuffle of the input sequence. Given the issue mentioned in point 4, the output might not be correct.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is partially correct. While the program correctly calculates the balance and constructs the `details` list, the final step of constructing the result string is flawed. The characters should be joined in the order of their original positions, not the order they appear in the sorted `details` list.

### Final:
**False**
