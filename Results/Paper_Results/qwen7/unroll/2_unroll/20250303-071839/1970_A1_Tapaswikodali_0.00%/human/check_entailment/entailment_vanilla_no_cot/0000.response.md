Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic for the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization and Balance Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `balance` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character in the input string `s`, updating the balance for each opening `(` and decrementing it for each closing `)`.

2. **Recording Details**:
   - For each character, it records the current balance, the negative position (to ensure higher positions come first in case of equal balances), and the character itself.
   - This ensures that the details are recorded in a way that respects the required sorting criteria.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The details are sorted primarily by balance (in ascending order) and secondarily by position (in descending order due to the use of `-i`).

4. **Constructing the Result**:
   - After sorting, the program constructs the final result by joining the characters from the sorted details.

5. **Output**:
   - The result is printed, which is the balanced shuffle of the input string.

Given these steps, the program accurately performs the balanced shuffle operation as specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
