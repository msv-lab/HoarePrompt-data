Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases internally. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and two binary strings `a_1` and `a_2` of length `n`. It returns a result based on the comparison of these binary strings for each test case.**

This means the function iterates over multiple test cases, each defined by `t`, `n`, and two binary strings. For each test case, it performs some operation (not specified here) on the binary strings and returns a result accordingly.
