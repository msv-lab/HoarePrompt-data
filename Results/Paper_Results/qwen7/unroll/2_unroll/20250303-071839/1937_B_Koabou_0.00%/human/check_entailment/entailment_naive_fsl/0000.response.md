Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the optimal path involves moving both right and down in a way that minimizes the resulting string.

Consider the following test case:
```
3
3
010
100
```

The expected output for this test case should be:
```
000
2
```

However, the program will produce an incorrect result because it does not properly handle the combination of right and down moves to minimize the string. The program attempts to find a specific pattern but does not account for all possible paths that could yield the lexicographically smallest string.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to consider all possible paths from the top-left to the bottom-right cell and compare them to find the lexicographically smallest string. The current implementation is too simplistic and does not cover all necessary cases.
