Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires constructing a sequence \(a\) of at most 25 non-negative integers such that:
   - No subsequence sums to \(k\).
   - All integers from 1 to \(n\) (excluding \(k\)) can be represented as a subsequence sum.

2. **Analyzed Code**:
   - The code iterates through each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it initializes a list `nums` with 21 elements, which are powers of 2.
   - It finds the index `idx` of the first element in `nums` that is greater than \(k\).
   - It appends three new elements to `nums`: \(k - \text{nums}[idx]\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + \text{nums}[idx] + 1\).
   - It removes the element at index `idx` from `nums`.
   - Finally, it prints the length of `nums` and its elements.

3. **Verification**:
   - The constructed list `nums` ensures that no subsequence sums to \(k\). This is because the only way to get a sum of \(k\) would involve the removed element, which is no longer in the list.
   - The list `nums` includes all necessary elements to form subsequences that sum to every integer from 1 to \(n\) except \(k\):
     - Powers of 2 ensure that all sums can be formed.
     - The adjustments involving \(k\) ensure that the sums cover all required values.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic in the code correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem's requirements for each test case.
   - The output format and constraints are satisfied.

Correctness: **True**
