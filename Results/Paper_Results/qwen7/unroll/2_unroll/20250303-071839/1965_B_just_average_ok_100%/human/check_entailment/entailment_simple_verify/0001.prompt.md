You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(21)]
        idx = -1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
def func():

        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(21)]
        
        idx = -1
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each representing the result of one test case. For each test case, two lines will be printed: the first line contains the length of the list `nums` after modifications, and the second line contains the elements of the list `nums` in ascending order. The list `nums` will always contain unique elements and will have a maximum length of 23 (since it starts with 21 elements and can add up to 2 more). The elements in `nums` will be powers of 2, adjusted by the value of `k`, and will include `k-nums[idx]`, `k+1`, and `k+nums[idx]+1`, where `idx` is the index just before the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The program initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\). This means `nums` will contain the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^{20}]`.
   - It finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and stores its index.
   - If `k` is a power of 2, it sets `idx` to the index of `k` directly.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the closest smaller power of 2 (`nums[idx]`) and uses it to construct additional elements in the sequence.

3. **Additional Elements**:
   - It appends `k - nums[idx]` to the list `nums`, ensuring that the sum of this element and `nums[idx]` equals `k`.
   - It also appends `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to ensure that sums of `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` are achievable.
   - Finally, it removes the element `1 << idx` (i.e., the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`).

4. **Output**:
   - The length of the constructed list `nums` is printed.
   - The elements of the list `nums` are printed.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:

1. **No Subsequence Summing to `k`**:
   - The construction ensures that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence because the only way to get close to `k` would be using `k - nums[idx]` and `nums[idx]`, which together form `k`. However, these are removed from the list, making `k` unachievable.

2. **Subsequences Summing to All Values from 1 to `n` Except `k`**:
   - The remaining elements in `nums` cover a wide range of sums.
   - By including `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, the program ensures that sums from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed.
   - The powers of 2 ensure that all intermediate sums are covered.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem requirements. Therefore, the given program is correct.
