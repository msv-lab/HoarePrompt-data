The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). It constructs a list `nums` containing specific values derived from \( k \) and prints the length and contents of this list for each test case. The list `nums` includes powers of 2, adjusted by \( k \), and additional values \( k - \text{nums}[i] \), \( k + 1 \), and \( k + \text{nums}[i] + 1 \), where \( \text{nums}[i] \) is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \). The final state of the program after each test case is the output of the length and sorted list `nums`.
