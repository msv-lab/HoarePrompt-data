Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each representing the result of one test case. For each test case, two lines will be printed: the first line contains the length of the list `nums` after modifications, and the second line contains the elements of the list `nums` in ascending order. The list `nums` will always contain unique elements and will have a maximum length of 23 (since it starts with 21 elements and can add up to 2 more). The elements in `nums` will be powers of 2, adjusted by the value of `k`, and will include `k-nums[idx]`, `k+1`, and `k+nums[idx]+1`, where `idx` is the index just before the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`.
