Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The program initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\). This means `nums` will contain the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^{20}]`.
   - It finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and stores its index.
   - If `k` is a power of 2, it sets `idx` to the index of `k` directly.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the closest smaller power of 2 (`nums[idx]`) and uses it to construct additional elements in the sequence.

3. **Additional Elements**:
   - It appends `k - nums[idx]` to the list `nums`, ensuring that the sum of this element and `nums[idx]` equals `k`.
   - It also appends `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to ensure that sums of `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` are achievable.
   - Finally, it removes the element `1 << idx` (i.e., the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`).

4. **Output**:
   - The length of the constructed list `nums` is printed.
   - The elements of the list `nums` are printed.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:

1. **No Subsequence Summing to `k`**:
   - The construction ensures that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence because the only way to get close to `k` would be using `k - nums[idx]` and `nums[idx]`, which together form `k`. However, these are removed from the list, making `k` unachievable.

2. **Subsequences Summing to All Values from 1 to `n` Except `k`**:
   - The remaining elements in `nums` cover a wide range of sums.
   - By including `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, the program ensures that sums from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed.
   - The powers of 2 ensure that all intermediate sums are covered.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem requirements. Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
