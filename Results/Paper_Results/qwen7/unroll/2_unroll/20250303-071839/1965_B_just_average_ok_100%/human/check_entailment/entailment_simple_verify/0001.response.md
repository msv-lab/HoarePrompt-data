### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key steps and logic of the program. Let's break down the program and verify each step against the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The program initializes a list `nums` with the first 21 powers of 2. This list is used to build the required sequence.
   - It finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and stores its index. This is done using the line `idx = -1` followed by the loop that breaks when it finds the first power of 2 greater than `k`.
   - If `k` is a power of 2, `idx` will be set to the index of `k`. Otherwise, `idx` will be set to the index of the largest power of 2 less than `k`.

3. **Additional Elements**:
   - The program appends `k - nums[idx]` to the list `nums`. This ensures that the sum of `k - nums[idx]` and `nums[idx]` equals `k`, but `k` itself is not included in the list.
   - It also appends `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to ensure that sums of `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` are achievable.
   - Finally, it removes the element `1 << idx` (i.e., the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`).

4. **Output**:
   - The length of the constructed list `nums` is printed.
   - The elements of the list `nums` are printed.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:

1. **No Subsequence Summing to `k`**:
   - The construction ensures that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence because the only way to get close to `k` would be using `k - nums[idx]` and `nums[idx]`, which together form `k`. However, these are removed from the list, making `k` unachievable.

2. **Subsequences Summing to All Values from 1 to `n` Except `k`**:
   - The remaining elements in `nums` cover a wide range of sums.
   - By including `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, the program ensures that sums from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed.
   - The powers of 2 ensure that all intermediate sums are covered.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem requirements. The original assessment accurately describes the logic and verifies the correctness of the program.

**Final: True**

The given program is correct.
