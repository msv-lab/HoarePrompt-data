Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a test case where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and `s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a maximum length of 10. The function returns information based on the string `s` for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to process multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t` and a string `s`. However, since the function definition does not explicitly mention accepting these parameters, the function's role is to handle the logic for each given test case where `t` and `s` are predefined. The function will return different outputs based on the content of the string `s` for each test case.
