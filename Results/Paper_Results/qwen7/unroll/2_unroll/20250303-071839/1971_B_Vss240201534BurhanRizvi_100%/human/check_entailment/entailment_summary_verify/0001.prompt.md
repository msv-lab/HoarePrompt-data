You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes up to 1000 test cases, where each test case includes a string `s` of lowercase English letters with a maximum length of 10. For each string `s`, it checks if the string has a length of 1 or consists of the same character repeated. If either condition is met, it prints "No". Otherwise, it generates a random permutation of the characters in `s` and prints "Yes" followed by this permutation.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Checking Length and Characters:**
   - If the length of `s` is 1, the program prints 'No'. This is correct because there is no way to rearrange a single character to form a different string.
   - If all characters in `s` are the same (i.e., `len(set(s)) == 1`) but the length is greater than 1, the program also prints 'No'. This is correct because if all characters are the same, any rearrangement will result in the same string.

3. **Generating a Different String:**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program generates a new string `s2` by randomly shuffling the characters of `s`.
   - It then checks if `s2` is the same as `s`. If they are the same, it tries to generate another string by moving the first character to the end (`s2 = s[1:] + s[0]`).
   - Finally, it prints 'Yes' followed by the generated string `s2`.

### Issues with the Program

1. **Random Shuffling:**
   - The use of `random.sample(s, len(s))` is generally fine, but it does not guarantee that `s2` will always be different from `s`. There is a small chance that the shuffled string could be the same as the original string due to the randomness.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where the string length is 1 or all characters are the same.
   - However, the program does not ensure that the generated string `s2` is different from `s` in all cases. For example, if the string is already a palindrome or has a specific structure that allows for only one unique permutation, the program might fail.

### Example Scenarios

- **Example 1:** `s = "codeforces"`
  - Randomly shuffling this string will likely produce a different string.
- **Example 2:** `s = "aaaaa"`
  - All permutations of "aaaaa" are the same, so the program correctly outputs 'No'.
- **Example 3:** `s = "co"`
  - Randomly shuffling "co" will produce "oc", which is different.
- **Example 4:** `s = "d"`
  - The program correctly outputs 'No' because the string length is 1.
- **Example 5:** `s = "nutdealer"`
  - Randomly shuffling this string will likely produce a different string.
- **Example 6:** `s = "mwistht"`
  - Randomly shuffling this string will likely produce a different string.
- **Example 7:** `s = "hhhhhhhhh"`
  - All permutations of "hhhhhhhhh" are the same, so the program correctly outputs 'No'.

### Conclusion

While the program handles most cases correctly, it does not guarantee that a different string will always be produced. Therefore, the program is not fully correct as it might fail in some edge cases.
