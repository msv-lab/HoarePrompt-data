Output State: **`test_cases` is the result of `func_1()`, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer represents the price a_i for Alice, `bonuses` is a list of n integers where each integer represents the price b_i for Bob, the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.**

The code `test_cases = func_1()` assigns the result of the function `func_1()` to the variable `test_cases`. Since the function `func_1()` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact output. However, we know that `t` is the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n`, `k`, `prices`, and `bonuses` are defined according to the given constraints. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
