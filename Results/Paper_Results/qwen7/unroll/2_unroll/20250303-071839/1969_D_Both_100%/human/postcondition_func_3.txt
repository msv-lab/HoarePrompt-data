The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of items \(n\), the number of operations \(k\), a list of item prices for Alice, and a list of item bonuses for Bob. For each test case, it calculates the maximum possible profit by strategically choosing items to buy and sell based on their prices and bonuses. The function returns the highest profit achieved across all test cases.
