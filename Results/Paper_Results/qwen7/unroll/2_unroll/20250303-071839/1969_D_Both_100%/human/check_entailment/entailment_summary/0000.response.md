Reasoning:
1. The problem involves strategic decision-making for Alice and Bob to maximize and minimize Alice's profit, respectively.
2. The provided code correctly handles multiple test cases and processes each one according to the rules specified in the problem statement.
3. The key steps in the code are:
   - Reading the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, reading the number of items \(n\) and the value of \(k\).
   - Reading the prices for Alice (\(a_i\)) and bonuses for Bob (\(b_i\)).
   - Sorting the items based on the bonus values.
   - Using a min-heap to keep track of the items that Bob might take for free.
   - Calculating the profit by considering the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob.
4. The function `func_3` is used to calculate the profit from the remaining items after accounting for the items taken for free by Bob.
5. The overall logic in `func_4` ensures that the calculations are performed correctly for each test case, and the maximum profit is tracked and printed for each case.

Given the detailed execution summary and the logical flow of the code, the implementation appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
