### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Function Definitions
1. **`func_1()`**: Returns the number of test cases.
2. **`func_2()`**: Returns a tuple of integers from a line of input.
3. **`func_3(primary_items, secondary_heap)`**: Computes the total profit based on the items in `primary_items` and the state of `secondary_heap`.
4. **`func_4()`**: The main function that processes each test case.

#### Main Function (`func_4()`)
1. **Reading Input**: It reads the number of test cases, then iterates over each test case.
2. **Heap Initialization**: Initializes a min-heap (`heap`) and a list (`remaining_items`).
3. **Reading Prices and Bonuses**: Reads the prices and bonuses for each item.
4. **Sorting and Initial Heap Population**: Sorts the items based on their bonuses and pushes the top `k` items into the heap.
5. **Profit Calculation**:
   - If there are more items than `k`, it calculates the profit using `func_3`.
   - It then iteratively processes the remaining items, updating the profit by considering whether to include or exclude items based on their net values (price - bonus).

#### Profit Calculation Logic
- The logic in `func_3` sums up the bonuses of items in the `secondary_heap` and adds the adjusted values of items in `primary_items`.
- The main loop in `func_4` ensures that only profitable items (where price - bonus ≥ 0) are considered, and it updates the heap accordingly.

### Verification Against Problem Description

1. **Test Case Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases.
2. **Item Selection and Profit Calculation**: The logic for selecting items and calculating profit aligns with the problem description.
3. **Optimal Strategy**: The program considers the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob, ensuring that Alice maximizes her profit and Bob minimizes it.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly initializes the heap and reads the necessary inputs for each test case.
   - The sorting and initial heap population steps ensure that the most valuable items (based on bonuses) are considered first.

2. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The `func_3` function correctly calculates the profit by summing the bonuses of the items in the `secondary_heap` and adding the adjusted values of items in `primary_items`.
   - The main loop in `func_4` ensures that only profitable items (where price - bonus ≥ 0) are considered, and it updates the heap accordingly.

3. **Heap Operations**:
   - The use of a min-heap allows efficient management of the items, ensuring that the least valuable items are removed when necessary.
   - The `heapq.heappushpop` operation efficiently updates the heap while maintaining the minimum value property.

### Conclusion

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. The program handles the inputs correctly, processes the items optimally, and calculates the profit accurately.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
