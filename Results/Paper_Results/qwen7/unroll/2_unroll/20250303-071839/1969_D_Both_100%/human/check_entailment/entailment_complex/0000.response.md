Reasoning:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly reads an integer from the input, which is within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and returns it. This integer represents the number of test cases to follow.
2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function reads a single line of space-separated integers from the input and returns a map object containing these integers. However, the map object should be converted to a list before being used further. This is a minor issue but can be corrected by converting the map object to a list.
3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function calculates the sum of the first element plus the second element of each tuple in `primary_items` if the sum of the elements in the tuple is greater than or equal to 0. However, the function does not handle the case where `secondary_heap` is empty, which might cause issues. This can be fixed by checking if `secondary_heap` is empty before performing any operations.
4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**: This function processes multiple test cases and calculates the maximum possible profit for each test case. It uses a min-heap to keep track of the best items to buy and sell. The overall logic seems correct, but there are a few points to verify:
   - The function correctly handles the scenario where Bob can take all items for free if Alice buys less than \(k\) items.
   - The function correctly calculates the profit by considering the best items to buy and sell based on their prices and bonuses.
   - The function iterates through the items and updates the profit accordingly, ensuring that the best possible profit is calculated.

Given the above analysis, the main issues are with the data types and edge cases in the functions. However, the overall logic and flow of the program seem correct and align with the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
