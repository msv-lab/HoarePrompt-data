State: **`test_cases` must be at least 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `prices` is a list of n integers, `bonuses` is a list of n integers, the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5**

Explanation:
- The loop `for _ in range(test_cases):` will execute as long as `test_cases` is at least 1.
- Since the loop is iterating over `test_cases`, `test_cases` must be a positive integer (at least 1) for the loop to execute.
- The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are used within each iteration of the loop, but their values do not directly control the loop's execution. They are part of the problem constraints and will be used within the loop body.
- The lists `prices` and `bonuses` are also used within each iteration of the loop and must be valid lists of the required length `n`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is that `test_cases` must be at least 1.
