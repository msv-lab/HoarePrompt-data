Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n`.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop. This is incorrect because the function should be called within the loop to process each test case.

3. **GCD Calculation and Problem Splitting**:
   - The program attempts to find the maximum balance by iterating through possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
   - It checks if `i` is a divisor of `x` using `x % i == 0`.
   - If `i` is a divisor, it checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` or `i`, and updates `ans` accordingly.
   - The final result is printed for each test case.

### Issues Identified:
- The function `func_1()` is not being called for each test case. Instead, the code directly processes the input without using the function.
- The logic for calculating the maximum balance seems correct based on the problem statement and the example provided.

### Corrected Version:
To fix the issue, we need to call `func_1()` inside the loop that processes each test case.

```python
from math import isqrt, gcd

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = func_1(x, n)
    print(ans)

def func_1(x, n):
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    return ans
```

### Conclusion:
After making the necessary correction, the program should work as intended. Therefore, the original program is incorrect due to the unused function `func_1()`. However, with the correction, it becomes correct.

**Correctness: False** (before correction)  
**Correctness: True** (after correction)
