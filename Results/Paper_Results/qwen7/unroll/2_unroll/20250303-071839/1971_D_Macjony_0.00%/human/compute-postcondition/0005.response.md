Functionality: **The function processes an integer `t` and `t` binary strings `s`, each with a length between 1 and 500. For each string `s`, it counts the number of consecutive characters and adjusts this count by subtracting 1 if the substring "01" appears anywhere in `s`. The function prints the adjusted count for each string `s`.**
