You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, s is a binary string such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 1
        
        flag = False
        
        j = 0
        
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        
        print(count)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, and for each `i` in the range of `t`, `count` is an integer representing the number of consecutive characters in the string `s` (input at the `i`-th iteration), adjusted by subtracting 1 if the substring "01" appears anywhere in `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an integer `t` and `t` binary strings `s`, each with a length between 1 and 500. For each string `s`, it counts the number of consecutive characters and adjusts this count by subtracting 1 if the substring "01" appears anywhere in `s`. The function prints the adjusted count for each string `s`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, it fails to account for strings that contain multiple segments of consecutive '0's followed by consecutive '1's. For example, consider the input "010101". The program would incorrectly count this as needing 3 pieces (one for each '0' and '1'), but it can actually be rearranged into a sorted binary string with just 2 pieces: "000" and "111".

To fix this, the program needs to properly identify and count the number of transitions from '0' to '1' and vice versa, and ensure that each segment of consecutive '0's or '1's is counted as a separate piece.
