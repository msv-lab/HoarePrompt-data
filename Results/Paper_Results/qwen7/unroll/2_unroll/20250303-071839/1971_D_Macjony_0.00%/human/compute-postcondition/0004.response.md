Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes an integer `t` and a binary string `s` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500 and 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500. It does not return any value directly but operates on these inputs.**

Note: The provided code snippet does not include the actual logic for processing `t` and `s`, so the functionality described here is based solely on the constraints given.
