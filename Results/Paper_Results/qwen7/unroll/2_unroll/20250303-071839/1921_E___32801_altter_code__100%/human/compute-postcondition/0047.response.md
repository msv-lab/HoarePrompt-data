Postcondition: **`t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using space as delimiter, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is incremented by `a`, `y1` is adjusted based on the condition (if `y2 <= y1`, then `y1` is set to `0`; otherwise, `y1` is adjusted by adding `a` to its previous value), `x2` is the fifth element of `r` reduced by `a`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r`, `x1` is less than or equal to `x2`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `c` is `-1` if `y2 <= y1` and `m - y1` otherwise, `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`. The condition `(b // 2 > a and abs(x2 - c) >= x1 + c and (1 <= y1 <= m) and (1 <= x1 <= n))` is true.**
