Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using space as delimiter, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is the third element of `r` increased by `a`, `y1` is the second element of `r`, `x2` is the fifth element of `r` decreased by `a`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r`, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`; `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `x2 > x1`, `x1 \geq 1`, and `x2 \leq n`, and `y1` is now equal to `m`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value of `m` to `y1`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
