Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, r is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using space as delimiter, n is the first element of r, m is the second element of r, x1 is incremented by 1, y1 is one less than the original y1 (which was equal to y2), x2 is the fifth element of r, and y2 is the sixth element of r.**

The value of `x1` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
