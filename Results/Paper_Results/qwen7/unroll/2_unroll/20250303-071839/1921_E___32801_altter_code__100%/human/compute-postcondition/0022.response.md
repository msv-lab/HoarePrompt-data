Postcondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, r is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using space as delimiter, n is the first element of r, m is the second element of r, x1 is incremented by 1, y1 is adjusted based on the relationship with y2 (if y2 > y1, y1 becomes one more than the original value; otherwise, y1 becomes one less than the original value), x2 is the fifth element of r, y2 is the sixth element of r, x2 is greater than x1, y1 is not equal to y2, and y1 is greater than or equal to y2**.
