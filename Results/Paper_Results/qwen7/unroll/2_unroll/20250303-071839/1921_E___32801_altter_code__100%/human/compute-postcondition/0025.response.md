Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, r is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using space as delimiter, n is the first element of r, m is the second element of r, x1 is incremented by 1, and y1 becomes one less than its original value because y2 is not greater than y1, x2 is the fifth element of r, and y2 is the sixth element of r, with x2 being greater than x1, and y1 is not equal to y2; a is m - y2.**

This means that the variable `a` is now assigned the value of `m - y2`. All other variables retain their previous conditions and values.
