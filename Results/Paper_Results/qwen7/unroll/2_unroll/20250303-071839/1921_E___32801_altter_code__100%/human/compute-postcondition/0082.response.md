Output State: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using space as delimiter, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is the third element of `r` increased by `a`, `y1` is the second element of `r`, `x2` is the fifth element of `r` decreased by `a`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r` plus `a`, `c` is `m - y2`**.

This means that the variable `c` is now assigned the value `m - y2`. All other variables retain their previous values as per the initial state.
