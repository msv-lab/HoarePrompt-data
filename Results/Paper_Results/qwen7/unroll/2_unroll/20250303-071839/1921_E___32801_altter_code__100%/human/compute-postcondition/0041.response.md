Output State: **`t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using space as delimiter, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is incremented by `a`, `y1` is now `0`, `x2` is the fifth element of `r` reduced by `a`, `y2` is `1`, `x1` is less than or equal to `x2`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `a` is `0` since `y2 - 1` equals `0`, `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`, `c` is `-1`.**

Explanation:
- `c = y1 - 1`: Since `y1` is now `0`, `c` is calculated as `0 - 1`, which results in `-1`.
