Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting a string using space as a delimiter.
- `n` is the first element of `r`.
- `m` is the second element of `r`.
- `x1` is the third element of `r` increased by `a`.
- `y1` is the fourth element of `r`.
- `x2` is the fifth element of `r` decreased by `a`.
- `y2` is the sixth element of `r`.
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
- `b` is `x2 - x1`.
- `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`.
- The current value of `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('draw')
```

Given the conditions, the print statement will simply output the string `'draw'`.

Output: **draw**
