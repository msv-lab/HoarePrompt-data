Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `r`, which iterates over the `results` list.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The variable `r` will take each element from the `results` list one by one.
   - The `results` list contains strings ('yes' or 'no') based on certain conditions checked for each input `n` and its corresponding string `arr`.
   - The loop will continue until all elements in the `results` list are processed.

3. **Initial state of `results` list**:
   - The length of the `results` list is equal to the value of `t`.
   - Each element in the `results` list is determined by the conditions mentioned in the problem statement.

4. **Conditions for each iteration**:
   - If the count of '1's in `arr` is 2 and '11' is a substring of `arr`, the result is 'no'.
   - If the count of '1's is even and the above condition is met, the result is also 'no'.
   - If the count of '1's is odd, the result is 'no'.
   - Otherwise, the result is 'yes'.

Since the loop is iterating over the `results` list, the only state that needs to be considered is the state of the `results` list itself. The values of `start`, `end`, and `t` do not directly affect the loop's execution or the values of `r`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the `results` list, ensuring it contains the correct number of elements (equal to `t`) and the correct values based on the conditions described.

**State:**
**`results` is a list containing strings 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions checked for each input `n` and its corresponding string `arr`, and the length of the `results` list is equal to the value of `t`.**
