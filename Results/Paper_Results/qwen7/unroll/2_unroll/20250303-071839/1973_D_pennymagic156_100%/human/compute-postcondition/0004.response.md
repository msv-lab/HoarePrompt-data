Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n // k + 1):` will start with `i = 1` and increment `i` until `i` reaches `n // k + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n // k + 1` must be at least 1, which means `n // k` must be non-negative. Since `k` is a positive integer and `n` is a positive integer, this condition is always true.
   - However, the loop will not execute if `n // k + 1` is less than 1, which would happen if `n < k`. But since `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, this condition is also always true.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing. This means we need to set `i` to its initial value, which is 1.
   - Additionally, we need to ensure that the loop can continue as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `n // k + 1`.

Given the constraints and the loop structure, the key is to ensure that `i` starts at 1 and that `n // k + 1` is a valid number of iterations.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `i` should be set to 1 (the starting value).
- `n` should be such that `n // k + 1` is a valid number of iterations, but since `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, this is inherently satisfied.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted is:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4**
