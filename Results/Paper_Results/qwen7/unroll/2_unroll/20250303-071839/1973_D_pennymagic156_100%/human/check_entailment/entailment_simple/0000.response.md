### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Handling:**
   - `func_1()`: This function correctly reads and returns a list of integers from the input, which are presumably `n` and `k`.
   - `func_2()`: This function correctly reads and returns an integer from the input, which is the response to a query.
   - `func_3()`: This function correctly reads and returns a tuple of two integers from the input, which are presumably the number of test cases and the values within each test case.
   - `func_4()`: This function correctly reads and returns the user's input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace.
   - `func_5()`: This function is responsible for the main logic of the program.

2. **Main Logic in `func_5()`:**
   - The function first reads `n` and `k` using `func_3()`.
   - It initializes `v` to 1 and iterates backward from `n` to 1, querying the maximum possible value of `f(1, r)` for each `r` from `n` to 1. If `v` equals `n`, it breaks the loop and sets `v` to `i`.
   - It then enters a nested loop where it tries to split the array into `k` subarrays such that each subarray has the same value `m = i * v`. It queries the smallest `r` for each starting point `l` such that `f(l, r) = i * v`.
   - If it successfully finds a valid split, it prints the result and exits.
   - If no valid split is found, it prints `-1`.

3. **Query and Response Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the queries and responses as specified in the problem statement.
   - It flushes the output after each query to ensure immediate processing.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles the constraints and edge cases as required, such as ensuring that the number of queries does not exceed `2n`.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
