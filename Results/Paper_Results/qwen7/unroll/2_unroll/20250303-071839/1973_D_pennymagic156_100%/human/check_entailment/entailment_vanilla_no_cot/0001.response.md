Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads `n` and `k` using `func_3()`, which calls `map(int, input().split())`.
   - This part is correct and expected.

2. **Finding Maximum Value `v`:**
   - The program iterates from `n` down to `1` and prints a query `? 1 {i * n}` to find the smallest `r` such that `f(1, r) = i * n`.
   - It breaks the loop when it finds a valid `r` and sets `v = i`.

3. **Checking for Valid Subarrays:**
   - The program then tries to find `k` subarrays where each subarray's product of length and maximum equals `v`.
   - It does this by iterating up to `n // k + 1` and checking if `l` can reach `n + 1` while maintaining the condition `f(l, r) = i * v`.
   - If it successfully finds `k` such subarrays, it prints the result and exits.
   - If it fails to find `k` such subarrays, it prints `-1`.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Finding Maximum Value `v`:**
   - The logic to find `v` seems correct. It iteratively checks the maximum possible values for `f(1, r)` and finds the smallest `r` for each value.
   - However, there's a potential issue: the program assumes that the first valid `r` found will be the correct `v`. This might not always be true if there are multiple valid `r` values for different `i * n`.

2. **Checking for Valid Subarrays:**
   - The logic to check for valid subarrays is mostly correct. It iteratively tries to split the array into `k` subarrays and ensures each subarray meets the condition.
   - However, the program assumes that the first valid split it finds is the correct one. It should ensure that all splits are valid before concluding.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases like `k = 1` or `n = 1` explicitly. It should handle these cases separately.
   - The program also does not handle the case where no valid split exists for the given `k`.

### Conclusion:

The program has some logical issues and does not fully address all edge cases. Specifically, it assumes the first valid `r` found is the correct `v` and does not ensure all splits are valid before concluding.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
