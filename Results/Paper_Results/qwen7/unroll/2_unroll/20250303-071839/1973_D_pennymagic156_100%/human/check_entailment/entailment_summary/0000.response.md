Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves finding the largest value \(m\) such that the array can be split into exactly \(k\) subarrays where each subarray has a product of its length and its maximum value equal to \(m\). The solution uses a binary search-like approach to determine the value of \(m\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: Reads a line of space-separated integers from standard input and returns them as a list of integers. This function is not used in `func_5`.
   - **func_2**: Reads an integer from standard input. This function is used in `func_5` to get the response from the queries.
   - **func_3**: Reads two space-separated integers from the standard input and returns them as a tuple. This function is used in `func_5` to get the initial values of \(n\) and \(k\).
   - **func_4**: Reads a line of input from standard input and returns it after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. This function is not used in `func_5`.
   - **func_5**: This function implements the logic to solve the problem. It first determines a lower bound for \(m\) by querying the maximum possible value for \(f(1, r)\). Then, it iteratively checks if the array can be split into \(k\) subarrays with the product of their lengths and maxima equal to \(m\).

3. **Verification**:
   - The function correctly initializes the search for \(m\) by querying the maximum possible value for \(f(1, r)\).
   - It then iteratively checks if the array can be split into \(k\) subarrays with the product of their lengths and maxima equal to \(m\).
   - If it finds such a split, it prints the value of \(m\) and terminates.
   - If no such split is found, it prints \(-1\) and terminates.

Given the provided information and the execution summaries, the function `func_5` correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
