Output State: **v is n, cnt is 0, l is n + 1 for each iteration of the outer loop, and the inner loop prints ? l i * v for each valid l from 1 to n.**

Explanation: During each iteration of the outer loop (controlled by `i`), the inner loop runs until `cnt` reaches 0 or `l` exceeds `n`. The condition `l == n + 1` and `cnt == 0` triggers the printing of `! i * v` and a call to `func_2()`, then returns. Since `v` is set to `n` at the start, it remains `n` throughout the loop iterations. The values of `cnt` and `l` are reset at the beginning of each outer loop iteration and reach the specified conditions, leading to the described output.
