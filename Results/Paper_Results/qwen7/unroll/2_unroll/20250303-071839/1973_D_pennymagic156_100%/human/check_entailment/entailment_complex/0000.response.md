Reasoning:
1. **Function Definitions and Purpose**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads a line of space-separated integers and returns them as a list.
   - `func_2()`: Reads an integer input from the user.
   - `func_3()`: Reads two space-separated integers and returns them as a tuple.
   - `func_4()`: Reads a line of input and returns it after stripping whitespace.
   - `func_5()`: Implements the logic to solve the problem.

2. **Function 5 Analysis**:
   - `func_5()` takes `n` and `k` as inputs, where \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
   - It initializes `v` to 1 and iterates backward from `n` to 1, printing queries to find the maximum value `v` such that \(f(1, r) = v\) for some `r`.
   - After finding `v`, it attempts to split the array into `k` subarrays where each subarray has a product of its length and maximum equal to `v`.
   - If successful, it prints the answer and returns.
   - If no such `v` is found, it prints `-1`.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The function correctly initializes and updates `v` to find the maximum possible value for the subarrays.
   - It checks if the found `v` can be used to split the array into `k` subarrays with the required properties.
   - The logic for querying and validating the splits is implemented correctly according to the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the provided function `func_5()` appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
