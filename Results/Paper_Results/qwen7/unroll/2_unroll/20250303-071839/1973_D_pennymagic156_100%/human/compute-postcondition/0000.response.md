Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, and they are the return values of `func_3()`**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = func_3()` calls the function `func_3()`, which returns two values. These returned values are assigned to `n` and `k`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are positive integers with the condition `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4`, after executing the code, `n` and `k` retain these properties but now specifically refer to the values returned by `func_3()`.
