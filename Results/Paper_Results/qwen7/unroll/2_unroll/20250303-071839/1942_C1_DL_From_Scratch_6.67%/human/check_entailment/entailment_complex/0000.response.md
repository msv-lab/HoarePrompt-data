Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be formed from a polygon with \(n\) sides, given that Bessie has already chosen \(x\) vertices and we can choose up to \(y\) additional vertices. Since \(y = 0\) in this version, we only need to use the \(x\) vertices Bessie has chosen.
2. The solution provided counts the number of gaps of length 1 between consecutive chosen vertices and adds 1 for the gap between the last chosen vertex and the total number of vertices \(n\). This approach is correct because each gap of length 1 represents an opportunity to draw a diagonal that forms a triangle.
3. The logic in the code correctly implements this approach:
   - It sorts the list of chosen vertices.
   - It iterates through the sorted list to count the number of gaps of length 1 between consecutive vertices.
   - It also checks the gap between the last chosen vertex and \(n\).
   - Finally, it prints the sum of the count and \(x - 2\), which accounts for the initial \(x - 2\) triangles that can always be formed from any set of at least 3 vertices.

Given that the logic matches the problem requirements and the implementation accurately follows the described approach, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
