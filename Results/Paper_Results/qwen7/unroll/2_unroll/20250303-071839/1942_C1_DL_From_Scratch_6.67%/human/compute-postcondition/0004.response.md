Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, it processes three integers n, x, and y (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), y = 0). It also processes x distinct integers representing vertices chosen by Bessie, with the constraint that the sum of x across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. The function returns information based on the processed data for each test case.**

This functionality describes a function that iterates over multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters and additional data related to vertices chosen by Bessie, and processes this information according to the given constraints.
