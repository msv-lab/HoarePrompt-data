Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
- We need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.
- Given a regular polygon with `n` sides, we can form triangles using non-intersecting diagonals.
- Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices, and we can choose up to `y` additional vertices.
- For this specific version, `y = 0`, so we only use the `x` vertices Bessie has chosen.
- The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangles formed by these vertices.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Vertices and Triangles**: To form a triangle, we need 3 vertices. Therefore, the maximum number of triangles we can form is `(x - 2)` if all vertices are optimally placed.
2. **Non-Intersecting Condition**: The condition of non-intersecting diagonals means we need to ensure that the vertices form a convex hull and that the triangles do not overlap.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        count = 0
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        num = n - list0[-1]
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        print(count + x - 2)
```

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - `T`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read `n`, `x`, and `y`.
   - Read the `x` chosen vertices into `list0`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - Sort the chosen vertices to facilitate the calculation of gaps between consecutive vertices.

3. **Counting Gaps**:
   - Iterate through the sorted list and count the number of gaps of length 1 between consecutive vertices.
   - This step is unnecessary for the problem since we are only interested in forming triangles using the given vertices.

4. **Calculating Remaining Vertices**:
   - Calculate the number of vertices after the last chosen vertex (`num = n - list0[-1]`).
   - If this value is 1, increment the count.

5. **Output**:
   - Print the result of `count + x - 2`, which should be `x - 2` since `y = 0`.

### Correctness Check:
- The program does not correctly calculate the number of triangles. It counts gaps of length 1, which is not relevant for forming triangles.
- The logic to calculate the number of triangles should directly use `x - 2` since the vertices are already chosen and we are forming triangles without any additional vertices.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it includes unnecessary steps and does not correctly calculate the number of triangles.

**Correctness: **False**
