State: **`T` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, _ is now 1** 

Explanation:
- The variable `_` is used as a throwaway variable in the `for` loop and is automatically incremented with each iteration. It does not need to be explicitly set before the loop starts; its value will be 1 at the start of the first iteration.
- The variable `T` is the only variable mentioned in the loop head that affects whether the loop can execute. Since the loop runs `T` times, `T` must be a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4) for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `T` is within the given constraints, and `_` will be 1 at the start of the first iteration.
