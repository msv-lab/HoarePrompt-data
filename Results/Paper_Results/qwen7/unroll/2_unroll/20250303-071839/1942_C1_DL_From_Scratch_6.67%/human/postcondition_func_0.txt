The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n, x, and y along with x distinct integers representing vertices. It calculates and prints the value of `count` plus `x-2`, where `count` is incremented by 1 for each pair of consecutive elements in the sorted list of vertices that have a difference of exactly 1, and also for the difference between the last vertex and n if it is exactly 1.
