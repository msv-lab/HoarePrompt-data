You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        count = 0
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        num = n - list0[-1]
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        print(count + x - 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n, x, and y along with x distinct integers representing vertices. It calculates and prints the value of `count` plus `x-2`, where `count` is incremented by 1 for each pair of consecutive elements in the sorted list of vertices that have a difference of exactly 1, and also for the difference between the last vertex and n if it is exactly 1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
- We need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.
- Given a regular polygon with `n` sides, we can form triangles using non-intersecting diagonals.
- Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices, and we can choose up to `y` additional vertices.
- For this specific version, `y = 0`, so we only use the `x` vertices Bessie has chosen.
- The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangles formed by these vertices.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Vertices and Triangles**: To form a triangle, we need 3 vertices. Therefore, the maximum number of triangles we can form is `(x - 2)` if all vertices are optimally placed.
2. **Non-Intersecting Condition**: The condition of non-intersecting diagonals means we need to ensure that the vertices form a convex hull and that the triangles do not overlap.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        count = 0
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        num = n - list0[-1]
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        print(count + x - 2)
```

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - `T`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read `n`, `x`, and `y`.
   - Read the `x` chosen vertices into `list0`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - Sort the chosen vertices to facilitate the calculation of gaps between consecutive vertices.

3. **Counting Gaps**:
   - Iterate through the sorted list and count the number of gaps of length 1 between consecutive vertices.
   - This step is unnecessary for the problem since we are only interested in forming triangles using the given vertices.

4. **Calculating Remaining Vertices**:
   - Calculate the number of vertices after the last chosen vertex (`num = n - list0[-1]`).
   - If this value is 1, increment the count.

5. **Output**:
   - Print the result of `count + x - 2`, which should be `x - 2` since `y = 0`.

### Correctness Check:
- The program does not correctly calculate the number of triangles. It counts gaps of length 1, which is not relevant for forming triangles.
- The logic to calculate the number of triangles should directly use `x - 2` since the vertices are already chosen and we are forming triangles without any additional vertices.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it includes unnecessary steps and does not correctly calculate the number of triangles.

**Correctness: **False**
