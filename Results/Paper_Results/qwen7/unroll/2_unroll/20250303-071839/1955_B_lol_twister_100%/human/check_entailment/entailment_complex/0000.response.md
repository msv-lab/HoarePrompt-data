Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to check if the given list of numbers `l` can form a progressive square based on the given `n`, `c`, and `d`. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Input**: For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n`, `c`, and `d`, and the list `l` of integers.
3. **Function Call**: It calls the function `func_1(n, c, d, l)` with the appropriate parameters.
4. **Function Logic**:
   - **Step 1**: Find the minimum value `a` in the list `l`.
   - **Step 2**: Generate the expected progressive square values `li` using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for each position `(k, h)` in the \( n \times n \) matrix.
   - **Step 3**: Sort both the generated list `li` and the original list `l`.
   - **Step 4**: Compare the sorted lists `l` and `li`. If they are identical, return `'yes'`, indicating that the list `l` can form a progressive square. Otherwise, return `'no'`.

The logic in the function `func_1` is sound and correctly checks whether the given list `l` can be rearranged to match the structure of a progressive square. The sorting step ensures that the order of elements is correctly compared.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly determines whether the given list can form a progressive square.

Correctness: **True**
