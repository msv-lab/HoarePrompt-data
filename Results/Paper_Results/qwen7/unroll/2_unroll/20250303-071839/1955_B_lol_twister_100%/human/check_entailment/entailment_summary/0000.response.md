Reasoning:
1. The program correctly identifies the minimum value `a` from the input list `l`.
2. It then generates the expected progressive square values using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for each cell `(k, h)` in the \( n \times n \) matrix.
3. The generated list `li` is sorted to match the order of the progressive square.
4. The original list `l` is also sorted and compared with `li`. If they match, it means the input list `l` can form a progressive square, and the function returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.
5. Given the constraints and the problem description, this approach should work correctly for all valid inputs as per the provided execution summary.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
