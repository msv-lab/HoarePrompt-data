Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 500), two integers `c` and `d` (where 1 <= c, d <= 10^6), and a list of integers `l` (where the length of `l` is n^2 and 1 <= l_i <= 10^9). Depending on the conditions within the function, it returns either 'yes' or 'no'.**
