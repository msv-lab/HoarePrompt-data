Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for constructing a progressive square. Specifically, the program generates a sequence `li` based on the formula `a + k * c + d * h`, but this does not guarantee that the sequence will match the input array `l` for all possible values of `a`, `c`, and `d`.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  3
  3 2 3
  3 9 6 5 7 1 10 4 8
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```

However, the program incorrectly outputs `YES` because it does not account for the fact that the minimum value in the input array `l` might not be the starting value `a_{1,1}`. The program assumes that the minimum value in `l` is `a`, but this is not necessarily true for all progressive squares.

For example, in the given test case, the input array `l` is `[3, 9, 6, 5, 7, 1, 10, 4, 8]`. The minimum value is `1`, but the progressive square construction should start from the correct initial value `a_{1,1}`, which is not necessarily the minimum value in the array.

A correct approach would involve finding the correct starting value `a` such that the generated sequence matches the sorted input array `l`. The current implementation does not handle this correctly, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
