Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. The states of other variables remain unchanged.**

This means that the variable `t` now holds the value entered by the user, converted to an integer, and it must satisfy the condition 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. All other variables (`n` and `a`) are not affected by this code snippet.
