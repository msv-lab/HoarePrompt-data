Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that need to be addressed to correctly solve the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `pk`:**
   ```python
   if n % 2 == 0:
       pk = n // 2
   else:
       pk = n // 2
   ```
   This code assigns `pk` to `n // 2` regardless of whether `n` is even or odd. However, the value of `pk` should be adjusted to ensure that the condition for being "as close to the middle of the village as possible" is met correctly. Specifically, when `n` is even, `pk` should be `(n // 2) + 1`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Percentages:**
   ```python
   zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))
   one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))
   ```
   The percentages are calculated as a percentage of the total number of houses on each side, but they should be calculated as a percentage of the number of residents on each side, which is simply the count of zeros and ones, not the number of houses.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   The logic for handling edge cases where the optimal position might be before the first house or after the last house needs to be more robust.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        sl = list(s)
        o = sl.count('1')
        z = sl.count('0')
        
        zero, one = 0, 0
        lst = []
        mini = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero += 1
            else:
                one += 1
            
            if zero >= math.ceil((i + 1) / 2) and one >= math.ceil((n - i - 1) / 2):
                lst.append(i + 1)
        
        if not lst:
            # If no valid position found, check the edge cases
            if z >= math.ceil(n / 2):
                print(0)
            elif o >= math.ceil(n / 2):
                print(n)
            else:
                print(0)
        else:
            mini = min(abs(n // 2 - pos) for pos in lst)
            final = [pos for pos in lst if abs(n // 2 - pos) == mini]
            print(min(final))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly calculates the required conditions and handles edge cases appropriately.
