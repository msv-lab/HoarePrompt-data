Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes inputs through a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes three integers n, k, and x, and an array a of n integers. It returns a result based on the conditions provided.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with its own set of integers n, k, x, and an array a. The function processes these inputs according to the given constraints and returns a result for each test case.
