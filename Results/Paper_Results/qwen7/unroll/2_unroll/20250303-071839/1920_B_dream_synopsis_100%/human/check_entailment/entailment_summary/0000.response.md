Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x` along with the array `a`.
3. It sorts the array in descending order, which is a good start since Alice would ideally want to remove the smallest elements and Bob would want to negate the largest possible elements.
4. The program then iterates through a range up to `k + 1` and calculates various sums based on the conditions involving `x` and `k`. However, there are some issues with the logic:
   - The initial sum (`sum1`) is calculated correctly as the sum of the sorted array.
   - The loop for calculating sums seems to be trying to account for different scenarios where Alice removes elements and Bob negates elements. However, the logic inside the loop is flawed:
     - The condition `if i == 0:` is not necessary and leads to incorrect calculations.
     - The calculation of `sums` inside the loop does not properly account for the optimal strategy for both players.
     - The approach of adding and subtracting elements in a specific manner does not reflect the optimal strategy for the game.
5. The final `max(ans)` is intended to find the best possible sum after both players have made their moves, but the way `ans` is populated is incorrect.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for the game as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
