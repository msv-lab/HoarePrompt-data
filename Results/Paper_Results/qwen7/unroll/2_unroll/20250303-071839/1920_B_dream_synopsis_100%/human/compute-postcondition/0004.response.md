Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n, k, and x, and an array a of n integers. For each test case, it sorts the array in descending order, calculates a series of sums based on specified conditions involving x and k, and appends these sums to a list. Finally, it prints the maximum value from this list.**
