Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `x * x <= n`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `x` is 1
   - `cnt` is 0 (not relevant to the loop condition)
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `m` is an input integer (not relevant to the loop condition)

3. **Determine the necessary adjustment**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `x * x <= n` must be true.
   - Currently, `x` is 1, so `x * x` is `1 * 1` which is 1.
   - Therefore, the condition becomes `1 <= n`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `x` is fixed at 1, no adjustment is needed for `x`.
   - The only relevant variable is `n`, and it must satisfy the condition `1 <= n`.

Thus, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
