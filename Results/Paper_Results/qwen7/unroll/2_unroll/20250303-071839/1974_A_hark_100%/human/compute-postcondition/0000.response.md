Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `ap`. The value of `t` remains unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^4, and `ap` now holds the value of the input integer.
