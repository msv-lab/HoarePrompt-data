Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of two non-negative integers x and y (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99) within a range defined by a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it performs some unspecified operation and returns the result accordingly.**

Note: The specific operation to be performed on x and y is not detailed in the given information, so the functionality description focuses on the structure and parameters involved.
