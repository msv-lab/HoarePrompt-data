You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x > 0 and y > 0:
            bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
            x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
            bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
            print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        elif x == 0 and y > 0:
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
        elif x > 0 and y == 0:
            print(math.ceil(x / 15))
        else:
            print(0)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will be a list of integers, each representing the value printed during each iteration of the loop based on the input values provided for `x` and `y`. The length of this list will be equal to the value of `ap`, and each element in the list will be calculated according to the conditions specified in the loop body. If `x` and `y` are both positive, the value will be the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`. If `x` is zero and `y` is positive, the value will be `math.ceil(y / 2)`. If `x` is positive and `y` is zero, the value will be `math.ceil(x / 15)`. If both `x` and `y` are non-positive, the value will be `0`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of two non-negative integers x and y (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99) within a range defined by a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it performs some unspecified operation and returns the result accordingly.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
