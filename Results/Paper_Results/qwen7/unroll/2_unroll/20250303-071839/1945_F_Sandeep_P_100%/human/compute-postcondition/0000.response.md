Output State: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer representing the number of mushrooms, v is a list of integers representing the magic powers of the mushrooms, and p is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.**

The given code snippet is a docstring for a decorator function and does not actually modify any of the variables `t`, `n`, `v`, or `p`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged after the code is executed.
