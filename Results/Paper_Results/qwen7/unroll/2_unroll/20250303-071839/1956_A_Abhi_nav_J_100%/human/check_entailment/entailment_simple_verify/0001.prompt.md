You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene invented a new game based on an increasing sequence of integers a_1, a_2,
\ldots, a_k .

In this game, initially n players are lined up in a row. In each of the rounds
of this game, the following happens:

  * Nene finds the a_1 -th, a_2 -th, \ldots , a_k -th players in a row. They are kicked out of the game simultaneously. If the i -th player in a row should be kicked out, but there are fewer than i players in a row, they are skipped. 

Once no one is kicked out of the game in some round, all the players that are
still in the game are declared as winners.

For example, consider the game with a=[3, 5] and n=5 players. Let the players
be named player A, player B, \ldots , player E in the order they are lined up
initially. Then,

  * Before the first round, players are lined up as ABCDE. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. These are players C and E. They are kicked out in the first round. 
  * Now players are lined up as ABD. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. The 3 -rd player is player D and there is no 5 -th player in a row. Thus, only player D is kicked out in the second round. 
  * In the third round, no one is kicked out of the game, so the game ends after this round. 
  * Players A and B are declared as the winners. 

Nene has not yet decided how many people would join the game initially. Nene
gave you q integers n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_q and you should answer the following
question for each 1 \le i \le q independently:

  * How many people would be declared as winners if there are n_i players in the game initially? 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 250 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line case contains two integers k and q (1 \le k, q \le 100 ) — the
length of the sequence a and the number of values n_i you should solve this
problem for.

The second line contains k integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k (1\leq
a_1<a_2<\ldots<a_k\leq 100 ) — the sequence a .

The third line contains q integers n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_q (1\leq n_i \leq 100 ).

Output

For each test case, output q integers: the i -th (1\le i \le q ) of them
should be the number of players declared as winners if initially n_i players
join the game.

Note

The first test case was explained in the statement.

In the second test case, when n=1 , the only player stays in the game in the
first round. After that, the game ends and the only player is declared as a
winner.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have a sequence \(a\) of length \(k\) where \(a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_k\).
- For each input \(n\), we need to simulate the game and determine how many players remain at the end.
- The game continues until no more players can be removed in a round.

### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \(k\) and \(q\).
   - It then reads the sequence \(a\) and the list of \(n_i\) values.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to simulate the removal of players.
   - However, the logic in `func_1` is incorrect. It simply returns the minimum of `a` and `b`, which does not correctly simulate the game described in the problem.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The function `func_1` is not correctly implementing the logic required to remove players from the game.
- The function should simulate the removal process as described in the problem statement, but instead, it returns a simple minimum value, which is not relevant to the problem.

### Example Walkthrough:
Given the example in the problem statement:
- Sequence \(a = [3, 5]\)
- \(n = 5\)

The expected steps are:
1. Initial lineup: ABCDE
2. Round 1: Remove 3rd and 5th players -> C and E are removed -> Remaining: ABD
3. Round 2: Remove 3rd player -> D is removed -> Remaining: AB
4. No more players can be removed -> Game ends

Expected output: 2 (Players A and B are winners).

However, the current implementation will not correctly simulate these steps because `func_1` does not handle the logic of removing players in rounds.

### Conclusion:
Since the function `func_1` is not correctly implemented to simulate the game as described, the provided code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
