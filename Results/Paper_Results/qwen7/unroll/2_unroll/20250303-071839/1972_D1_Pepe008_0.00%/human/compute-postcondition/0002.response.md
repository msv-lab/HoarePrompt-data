Output State: The value of `T` is reduced to 0 after all iterations of the loop have finished. For each iteration `t` from 0 to `T-1`, the code calculates a sum based on the values of `a` and `b` provided by user input, and then prints the result. However, the final state of the output does not store or depend on these intermediate results; it only tracks the decrement of `T` to 0.
