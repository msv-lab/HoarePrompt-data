Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs using a different approach that does not adhere to the problem's requirements.

For example, consider the test case \(n = 3\) and \(m = 5\):

- According to the problem description, the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((1, 3)\), and \((1, 4)\).
- However, the program calculates the number of valid pairs using a formula that does not account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To verify this, let's manually check the pairs:
- For \((1, 1)\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\), which is not a multiple.
- For \((1, 2)\): \(1 + 2 = 3\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(1, 2) = 2\), which is not a multiple.
- For \((1, 3)\): \(1 + 3 = 4\) and \(3 \cdot \gcd(1, 3) = 3\), which is not a multiple.
- For \((1, 4)\): \(1 + 4 = 5\) and \(4 \cdot \gcd(1, 4) = 4\), which is not a multiple.
- For \((2, 2)\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 4\), which is a multiple.
- For \((2, 4)\): \(2 + 4 = 6\) and \(4 \cdot \gcd(2, 4) = 8\), which is not a multiple.
- For \((3, 3)\): \(3 + 3 = 6\) and \(3 \cdot \gcd(3, 3) = 9\), which is not a multiple.
- For \((3, 6)\): \(3 + 6 = 9\) and \(6 \cdot \gcd(3, 6) = 18\), which is not a multiple.

The program fails to correctly identify these valid pairs, hence it is incorrect.
