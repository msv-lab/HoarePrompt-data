Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program aims to count the number of ordered pairs `(i, j)` such that `1 ≤ i ≤ a`, `1 ≤ j ≤ b`, and `(i + j) % (j * gcd(i, j)) == 0`.
   - However, the program does not directly check this condition. Instead, it uses a different approach involving a summation formula which seems incorrect based on the problem statement.

3. **Summation Formula:**
   - The formula used in the program is `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. This formula is derived from a different problem and does not directly solve the given problem.
   - The logic inside the loop `for i in range(1, b + 1):` does not correctly implement the condition `(i + j) % (j * gcd(i, j)) == 0`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result after calculating `suma - 1`. This subtraction by 1 is not explained and might be incorrect.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate through all possible pairs `(i, j)` and check if they satisfy the condition `(i + j) % (j * gcd(i, j)) == 0`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for i in range(1, a + 1):
            for j in range(1, b + 1):
                if (i + j) % (j * math.gcd(i, j)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
