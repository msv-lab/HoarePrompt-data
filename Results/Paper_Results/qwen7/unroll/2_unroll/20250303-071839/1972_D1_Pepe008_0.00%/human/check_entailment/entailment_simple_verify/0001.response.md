### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program:

1. **Incorrect Condition Check:**
   - The program attempts to use a summation formula to count the valid pairs without actually checking the condition `(i + j) % (j * gcd(i, j)) == 0`. This is fundamentally incorrect because the problem requires explicitly verifying this condition for each pair `(i, j)`.

2. **Incorrect Summation Formula:**
   - The formula `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` is derived from a different problem and does not apply to this specific problem. The logic inside the loop does not correctly implement the required condition.

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - The output calculation `print(suma - 1)` is not explained and might be incorrect. Given the nature of the problem, subtracting 1 from the sum is not necessary.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

### Final Evaluation

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly implement the required condition and uses an incorrect summation formula.
