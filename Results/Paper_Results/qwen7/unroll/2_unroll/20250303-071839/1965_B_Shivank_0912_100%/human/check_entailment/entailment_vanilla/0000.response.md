Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates through each test case.
   
2. **Variable Initialization:**
   - `i` is initialized to 0. This variable is used to determine the appropriate power of 2 to use in constructing the sequence.

3. **Finding the Appropriate Power of 2:**
   - The loop `while 1 << i + 1 <= k:` ensures that `i` is set to the largest integer such that \(2^{i+1} \leq k\). This means `i` is effectively the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k/2\).

4. **Constructing the Sequence:**
   - The sequence `ans` is constructed as follows:
     - `ans[0] = k - (1 << i)`: This ensures that there is no subsequence summing to `k`.
     - `ans[1] = k + 1`: This ensures that there is a subsequence summing to `k + 1`.
     - `ans[2] = k + 1 + (1 << i)`: This ensures that there is a subsequence summing to `k + 1 + (1 << i)`.
     - The remaining elements are powers of 2 up to \(2^{19}\): `ans[j] = 1 << j` for `j` from 0 to 19, excluding `i`.

5. **Output:**
   - The length of the sequence `ans` is printed.
   - The sequence `ans` is printed.

### Verification Against Problem Constraints:

- **Sequence Size:**
  - The sequence `ans` has a maximum length of 25 because it includes the three specific values plus up to 20 powers of 2.

- **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
  - The value `k - (1 << i)` ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` because any subsequence containing this value will have a sum that is at least `k - (1 << i)` and cannot reach exactly `k`.

- **Subsequences Summing to All Values from 1 to `n` Except `k`:**
  - The sequence includes all necessary powers of 2, which can be combined to form any sum from 1 to \(2^{20} - 1\).
  - By including `k + 1` and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, the sequence can cover a wide range of sums.
  - The remaining powers of 2 ensure that all values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed.

### Conclusion:

The program constructs a sequence that meets all the requirements specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
