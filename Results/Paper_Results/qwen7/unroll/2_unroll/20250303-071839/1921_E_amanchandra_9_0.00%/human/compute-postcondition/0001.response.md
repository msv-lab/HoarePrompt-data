Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob'. The number of lines will be equal to the number of test cases provided. For each test case, the output depends on the relative positions of (xa, ya) and (xb, yb) within the grid defined by dimensions h and w. If xa is greater than xb, the output is 'Draw'. Otherwise, it checks the vertical positions and determines if Alice ('Alice') or Bob ('Bob') can win based on their positions relative to the midpoint between xa and xb.
