Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It then reads the dimensions of the board (`h`, `w`) and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (`xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`).

2. **Initial Comparison:**
   - The program checks if `xa > xb`. If this condition is true, it prints "Draw". This part is correct because if Alice starts higher than Bob, neither can capture the other since Alice can only move down and Bob can only move up.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program calculates `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`, which represents half the vertical distance between Alice and Bob.
   - It then checks if `abs(xa - xb)` is odd using `if abs(xa - xb) % 2:`. This is necessary because the parity (odd or even nature) of the distance affects the outcome.
     - If the distance is odd, it sets the boundaries for Bob's possible moves (`l` and `r`).
     - It then checks if Alice can capture Bob within these boundaries.
     - If the distance is even, it sets the boundaries for Alice's possible moves and checks if Bob can capture Alice within these boundaries.

4. **Boundary Calculations:**
   - The boundaries `l` and `r` are calculated based on the distance `x` and the current position of Bob (`yb`).
   - The program then checks if Alice can capture Bob within the range `[l, r]` when the distance is odd, and similarly for Bob when the distance is even.

5. **Capture Check:**
   - The program uses `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` to check if Alice can capture Bob when the distance is odd.
   - Similarly, it uses `abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x` to check if Bob can capture Alice when the distance is even.

### Conclusion:
The logic in the program appears to be correct based on the problem description. It handles the different scenarios (even and odd distances) appropriately and correctly determines the outcome based on the positions and movements of the chips.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
