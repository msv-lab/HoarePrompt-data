Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, n is the first integer input split from input, k is the second integer input split from input.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of space-separated integers as input and splits them into two integers, which are then assigned to `n` and `k` respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged and retains its initial state, being an integer between 1 and 1000.
