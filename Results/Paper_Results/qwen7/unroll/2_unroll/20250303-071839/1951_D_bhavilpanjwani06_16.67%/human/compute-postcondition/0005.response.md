Output: **YES**

Explanation: 
- The initial state defines that `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` and `k` are positive integers with 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
- It is explicitly stated that `n` is equal to `k`.
- The `print('YES')` statement simply outputs the string 'YES', regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string 'YES' without referencing any variables whose values need to be calculated, the output is simply 'YES'.
