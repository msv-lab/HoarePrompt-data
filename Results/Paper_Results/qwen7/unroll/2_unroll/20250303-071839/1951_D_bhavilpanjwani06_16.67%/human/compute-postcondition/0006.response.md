Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `n` is the first integer input split from input.
- `k` is the second integer input split from input.
- `n` is equal to `k`.

The print statement is `print(1)`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the integer `1`, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`, the output will be:

Output: **1**
