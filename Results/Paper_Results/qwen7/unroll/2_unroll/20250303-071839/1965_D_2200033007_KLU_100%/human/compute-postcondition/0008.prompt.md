You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: odds is a list of integers representing the subarray sums of the palindrome array a, excluding one sum. n is an integer representing the size of the array a, and 3 <= n <= 1000.
def func_3(odds, n):
    a = [0] * n
    prev = 0
    idx = (n - 1) // 2
    for x in odds:
        if idx == n - 1 - idx:
            a[idx] = x
        else:
            a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
            a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        
        prev = x
        
        idx = idx - 1
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is a list of length `n` where the first half of the elements are calculated based on the values in `odds`. For each element at index `i` (where `i <= (n - 1) // 2`), `a[i]` and `a[n - 1 - i]` are set to `(x - prev) // 2` for the corresponding `x` in `odds`. The last element `a[n-1]` is set to the last value in `odds`. All other elements in `a` remain 0. `odds` remains unchanged, `n` remains the same, `prev` is the last value in `odds`, and `idx` is `-1`.
    return a
    #The program returns a list `a` of length `n`, where the first half of the elements are calculated based on the values in `odds`. Each element at index `i` (where `i <= (n - 1) // 2`) is set to `(x - prev) // 2` for the corresponding `x` in `odds`, and `a[n-1]` is set to the last value in `odds`. All other elements in `a` remain 0. `odds` remains unchanged, `n` remains the same, `prev` is the last value in `odds`, and `idx` is `-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `odds` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `a` of length `n`, where the first half of the elements are calculated based on the values in `odds`. Each element at index `i` (where `i <= (n - 1) // 2`) is set to `(x - prev) // 2` for the corresponding `x` in `odds`, and `a[n-1]` is set to the last value in `odds`. All other elements in `a` remain 0.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `a` of length `n`, where the first half of the elements are calculated based on the values in `odds`. Each element at index `i` (where `i <= (n - 1) // 2`) is set to `(x - prev) // 2` for the corresponding `x` in `odds`, and `a[n-1]` is set to the last value in `odds`. All other elements in `a` remain 0. `odds` remains unchanged, `n` remains the same, `prev` is the last value in `odds`, and `idx` is `-1`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
