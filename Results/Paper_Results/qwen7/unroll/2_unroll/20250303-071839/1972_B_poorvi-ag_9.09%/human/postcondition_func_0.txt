The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, it determines whether to append 'yes' or 'no' to a results list based on the parity of `n` and the count of 'U' compared to 'D' in the string `s`. Finally, it prints each element in the results list on a new line.
