Output State: **A boolean indicating whether the length of s1 is greater than or equal to n times k, a substring of s1 starting from index r*k and ending at the end of s1, and the string s2.**

This means the program returns three things:
1. A boolean value indicating if the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`.
2. A substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1`.
3. The string `s2` which is the character removed from `alphabet` if there were multiple characters.
