### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` processes the string `s` and checks if it contains all necessary characters to form all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It initializes `s1` and `s2` as empty strings and creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through each character in `s`, adding it to `s1` if it is in `alphabet`. If `alphabet` has more than one character, it removes the character from `alphabet`. If `alphabet` has only one character, it adds the character to `s2` and resets `alphabet`.
   - After processing `s`, it calculates `r` as `len(s1) // k` and returns a tuple `(len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)`.
   - This means:
     - The first element of the tuple is a boolean indicating if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`.
     - The second element is a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end.
     - The third element is `s2`, which is a string containing the character that was removed if `alphabet` had only one character.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` and processes the result.
   - If `func_1` returns `False` (i.e., the length of `s1` is less than `n * k`), it prints "NO" and constructs a string `be9i` using the character from `s2` repeated `n - len(s2)` times, then appends `s2` and `be9i` to `OUT`.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "YES".

3. **Output Handling**:
   - The main program collects the results in `OUT` and prints each result.

### Correctness Check:

- The logic in `func_1` correctly checks if the string `s` contains enough characters to form all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- The main program correctly handles the output based on the result of `func_1`.

Given the problem description and the provided code, the program appears to be correct.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
