Reasoning:

1. The main program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it calls the `func_1` function to determine if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
3. The `func_1` function:
   - Filters the string `s` to include only characters from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - Removes one character if there's only one unique character in those alphabets.
   - Checks if the filtered string `s1` is at least `n * k` characters long.
   - Returns:
     - `True`, a substring of `s1` starting from the position `r*k`, and the string `s2` (which contains the removed character) if the condition is met.
     - `False`, the same substring, and the same `s2` otherwise.
4. Based on the result of `func_1`, the main program decides whether to output "YES" or "NO" and, if "NO", prints a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence of `s`.

Given the logic in the `func_1` function and how it is used in the main program, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
