Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` processes the string `s` to filter out characters that are not in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It keeps track of the characters from `s` that are in the first `k` alphabets in `s1`.
   - If there is more than one unique character in `s1`, it removes one of these characters and stores it in `s2`.
   - The function then checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`.
   - If `s1` is at least `n * k` characters long, it returns `True`, a substring of `s1` starting from the position `r * k`, and the string `s2`.
   - If `s1` is less than `n * k` characters long, it returns `False`, the same substring, and the same `s2`.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` and checks its output.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it prints "NO" and constructs a string of length `n` that cannot be a subsequence of `s` using the characters in `s1` and `s2`.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "YES".

3. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - The function correctly handles cases where the filtered string `s1` might be shorter than `n * k` characters.
   - It ensures that if there is only one unique character in `s1`, it still processes the string correctly.
   - The main program logic correctly identifies when a string of length `n` cannot be a subsequence of `s` and prints an appropriate result.

Given the analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the required functionality according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
