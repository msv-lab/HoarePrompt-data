You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Program:
t = int(input())
OUT = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    (b, s1, s2) = func_1(s, k, n)
    if not b:
        OUT.append('No')
        i = 97
        while i <= k + 97:
            if chr(i) not in s1:
                break
            i += 1
        be9i = chr(i) * (n - len(s2))
        OUT.append(s2 + be9i)
    else:
        OUT.append('Yes')
for i in OUT:
    print(i)

def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
    r = len(s1) // k
    return (len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a string `s`, an integer `k`, and an integer `n`. It filters `s` to keep only characters from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, removing one character if there's only one unique character in those alphabets. It then checks if the filtered string `s1` is at least `n` times `k` characters long. If so, it returns `True`, a substring of `s1` starting from the position `r*k` (where `r` is the smallest integer such that `r*k` is greater than or equal to the length of `s1`), and the string `s2` which contains the removed character. Otherwise, it returns `False`, the same substring, and the same `s2`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` followed by the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function aims to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets can be found as subsequences in `s`.
   - It initializes `s1` and `s2` as empty strings.
   - It creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through each character in `s`:
     - If the character is in `alphabet`, it removes the character from `alphabet` and appends it to `s1`.
     - If `alphabet` becomes an empty set, it appends the current character to `s2` and resets `alphabet` to the full set of `k` alphabets.
   - It calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
   - Finally, it returns a tuple indicating whether `s1` is at least `n * k` characters long, `s1` sliced from index `r * k` to the end, and `s2`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` and checks the result.
   - If `func_1` returns `(False, ..., ...)`, it prints "No" and constructs a string `be9i` using the first `k` alphabets that is not present in `s1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `(True, ..., ...)`, it prints "Yes".

### Detailed Verification:

1. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program should handle edge cases like when `s` is very short or when `n` is large compared to `k`.
   - The function `func_1` should correctly identify if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets can be found as subsequences in `s`.

2. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` seems flawed. Specifically, it doesn't ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are checked.
   - The variable `s1` accumulates characters from `s` that are in the first `k` alphabets, but it doesn't guarantee that all combinations of these characters are present.
   - The slicing and resetting of `alphabet` might miss some combinations.

3. **Constructing the Result String:**
   - The construction of `be9i` assumes that `s1` is missing some combination, but this assumption might not hold true for all cases.

### Conclusion:

Given the flaws in the logic of `func_1` and the assumptions made in constructing the result string, the program is not correctly solving the problem as described.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
