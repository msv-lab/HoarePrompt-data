Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: a string `s`, an integer `k`, and an integer `n`. It returns a boolean indicating whether the length of `s` is greater than or equal to `n` times `k`. Additionally, it returns a substring of `s` starting from index `r*k` (where `r` is the smallest integer such that `r*k` is greater than or equal to the length of `s`) and ending at the end of `s`, and the string `s` itself.**

Note: The description assumes that the function returns these three items together in a tuple or similar structure, but since the exact return type isn't specified, the description focuses on the nature of the returned values.
