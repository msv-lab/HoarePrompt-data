The function accepts a string `s`, an integer `k`, and an integer `n`. It filters `s` to keep only characters from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, removing one character if there's only one unique character in those alphabets. It then checks if the filtered string `s1` is at least `n` times `k` characters long. If so, it returns `True`, a substring of `s1` starting from the position `r*k` (where `r` is the smallest integer such that `r*k` is greater than or equal to the length of `s1`), and the string `s2` which contains the removed character. Otherwise, it returns `False`, the same substring, and the same `s2`.
