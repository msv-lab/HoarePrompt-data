Reasoning:
1. The program correctly categorizes the constraints into three lists: `big` (for constraints where \( k \) must be greater than or equal to \( x \)), `less` (for constraints where \( k \) must be less than or equal to \( x \)), and `no` (for constraints where \( k \) must not be equal to \( x \)).
2. It calculates the potential range of \( k \) values by finding the difference between the minimum value in `less` and the maximum value in `big`.
3. It adjusts this range by subtracting the count of elements in `no` that fall within the calculated range.
4. The logic handles the special case where the range is less than 1 by printing 0.
5. Given the constraints and guarantees in the problem statement, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
