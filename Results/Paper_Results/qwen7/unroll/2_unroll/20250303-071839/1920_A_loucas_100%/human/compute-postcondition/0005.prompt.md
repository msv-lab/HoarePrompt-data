You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. There are n lines describing constraints, where each line contains two integers a and x such that a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        
        big = []
        
        no = []
        
        num = 0
        
        innerLoop = int(input())
        
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            x, a = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        
        num = min(less) - max(big) + 1
        
        if num < 1:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        for i in no:
            if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
                num -= 1
        
        print(num)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state depends on the specific values of `loop` and the inputs provided within each iteration of the loop. After executing all iterations, `loop` integers will be processed, and for each integer, a value of `num` will be calculated based on the elements in `big`, `less`, and `no`. The final output will be a series of values printed for each iteration, with each value representing `num` for that particular iteration. Each `num` is calculated as the difference between the minimum of `less` and the maximum of `big`, adjusted by the number of elements in `no` that fall within the range defined by `min(less)` and `max(big)`, ensuring this difference is at least 1. If the difference is less than 1, the output is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns a result based on a series of constraints involving an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and another integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100). For each of the n lines, it processes two integers a and x (a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), ensuring there is at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, and no duplicate constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
