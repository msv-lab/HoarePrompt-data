Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a result based on a series of constraints involving an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and another integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100). For each of the n lines, it processes two integers a and x (a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), ensuring there is at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, and no duplicate constraints.**
