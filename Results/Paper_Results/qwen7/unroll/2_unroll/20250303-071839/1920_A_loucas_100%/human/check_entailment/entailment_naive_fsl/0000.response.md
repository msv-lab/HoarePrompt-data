Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there is a constraint of type 3 (k must not be equal to some integer x) that falls within the range defined by the constraints of type 1 and 2. Specifically, the program calculates the range between the minimum value of `less` and the maximum value of `big` and subtracts the number of elements in `no` that fall within this range. However, it does not account for the fact that if an element in `no` is exactly equal to the minimum value of `less` or the maximum value of `big`, it should not be counted as it would violate the constraints.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
3 10
1 3
2 15
3 11
```
Here, the constraints are:
- \( k \geq 3 \)
- \( k \leq 15 \)
- \( k \neq 11 \)

The program will calculate the range from 3 to 15, which is 13 possible values. However, since 11 is not allowed, the correct answer should be 12, but the program incorrectly counts 11 as part of the valid range, resulting in 13 - 1 = 12 instead of 12 - 1 = 11.

To fix this, the program needs to check if the elements in `no` are exactly equal to the minimum value of `less` or the maximum value of `big` and exclude them accordingly.
