You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        big = []
        no = []
        num = 0
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            (x, a) = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        num = min(less) - max(big) + 1
        if num < 1:
            print(0)
            continue
        for i in no:
            if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
                num -= 1
        print(num)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of constraints involving integers \( t \) and \( n \). For each of the \( n \) lines, it reads two integers \( a \) and \( x \), categorizing them into three lists based on the value of \( a \): `big`, `less`, and `no`. It then calculates the difference between the minimum value in `less` and the maximum value in `big`, adjusting this difference by subtracting the count of elements in `no` that fall within the range defined by `min(less)` and `max(big)`. If this difference is less than 1, the output is 0; otherwise, the adjusted difference is printed. This process is repeated for each of the \( t \) test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `loop`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `innerLoop`.

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - It initializes three lists: `big`, `less`, and `no` to store the constraints of types 1, 2, and 3 respectively.
   - It iterates over each constraint and categorizes them into these lists based on their type.

3. **Calculating Initial Range:**
   - It calculates the initial range of possible values for `k` by finding the difference between the minimum value in `less` and the maximum value in `big`. This gives an initial count of potential values for `k` that could satisfy the constraints without considering the "not equal to" constraints.

4. **Adjusting for "Not Equal To" Constraints:**
   - It then iterates over the list `no` and subtracts 1 from the initial count for each value that falls within the range `[max(big), min(less)]`. This adjustment accounts for the fact that `k` cannot be equal to these specific values.

5. **Outputting Result:**
   - Finally, it prints the adjusted count of possible values for `k`.

### Verification Against Problem Description

1. **Guarantees:**
   - The problem guarantees that there will always be at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, ensuring that the initial range calculation will always be valid.
   - The problem also guarantees that no two constraints are the same, which ensures that the logic for adjusting the count will work correctly.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the initial range is invalid (i.e., `min(less) < max(big)`). In such a case, it correctly outputs `0`.
   - The program also correctly adjusts the count for "not equal to" constraints that fall within the valid range.

3. **Logic Consistency:**
   - The logic for calculating the initial range and adjusting for "not equal to" constraints is consistent with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints. It handles all specified edge cases and guarantees provided by the problem statement.
