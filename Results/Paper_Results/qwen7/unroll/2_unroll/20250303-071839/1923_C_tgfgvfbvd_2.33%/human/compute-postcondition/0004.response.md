Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of elements \(n\) and the number of queries \(m\), followed by an array \(l\) of length \(n\). It then calculates a prefix sum array \(p\) where each element \(p[i]\) represents the sum of the first \(i+1\) elements of \(l\). For each query defined by indices \(a\) and \(b\), it checks if the sum of the subarray from index \(a-1\) to \(b-1\) is at least twice the length of this subarray. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but outputs the results of all queries for each test case.**
