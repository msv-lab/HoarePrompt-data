Output State: The output state will consist of two integers separated by a space. The first integer represents the value of `mak2`, which is the final value of `mak` after the second main loop completes. The second integer is the value of `pans[mak]`, which is the last element in the list `pans` that satisfies the condition of being equal to or greater than `mak2`. This result is derived from the interactions with the hypothetical comparison oracle through the `?` and `!` commands, where the program queries the relative order between pairs of indices and outputs the final determined order.
