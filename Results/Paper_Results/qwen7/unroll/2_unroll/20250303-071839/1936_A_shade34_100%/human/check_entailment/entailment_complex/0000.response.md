### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to ensure its correctness according to the problem statement and the provided example.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n`.

2. **Finding the Maximum XOR Pair:**
   - The program initializes `mak` to 0.
   - It iterates from index 1 to `n-1` and compares `(p_mak | p_i)` with `(p_mak | p_i)`. This seems redundant and unnecessary since both expressions are identical.
   - If the result of the comparison is `<`, it updates `mak` to `i`. This step aims to find the index `i` where the bitwise OR with `mak` results in a smaller value compared to itself, which is not a meaningful comparison and likely incorrect logic.

3. **Second Loop:**
   - The program initializes `mak2` to `mak`.
   - It iterates through all indices and compares `(p_mak2 | p_i)` with `(p_mak2 | p_mak2)`. If the result is `<`, it updates `mak` to `i` and stores `i` in `pans`. If the result is `=`, it appends `i` to `pans`.
   - After the loop, it finds the index in `pans` where the bitwise OR with `mak2` is greater than `mak2` and updates `mak` accordingly.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The program prints the indices `mak2` and `pans[mak]` as the result.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Redundant Comparison:**
   - The comparison `(p_mak | p_i) < (p_mak | p_i)` is redundant and incorrect. This comparison will always be false, leading to no useful information.

2. **Incorrect Logic:**
   - The logic for finding the maximum XOR pair is flawed. The program does not correctly identify the indices that maximize the XOR operation.

3. **Query Limit:**
   - The program makes more than 3n queries, which violates the constraint of making at most 3n queries per test case.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.

### Correctness:
**False**
