Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a permutation of integers based on the number of test cases and the size of the permutation for each test case. It returns information about the permutation for each test case.**

Given the constraints, the function likely processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each of those test cases, it takes an integer `n` representing the size of the permutation, followed by a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. The function then performs some operation or returns information about each permutation based on the given constraints.
