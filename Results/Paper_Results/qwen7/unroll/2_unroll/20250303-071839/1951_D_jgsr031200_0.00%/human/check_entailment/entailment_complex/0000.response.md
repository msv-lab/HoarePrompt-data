Reasoning:

1. **Functionality Check**: The function `func_1(n, k)` correctly handles the three main cases:
   - When `n == k`, it prints "YES" followed by 1 twice and returns `n` (or `k`), which is correct.
   - When `n < k`, it prints "NO" and returns `None`, which is also correct.
   - When `n >= k`, it calculates the sum of `n` divided by each value in the list `[n - k + 1, 1]` and stores it in `h`. If `h < k`, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES", "2", and the values in the list `[n - k + 1, 1]`.

2. **Output Validation**:
   - For the case when `n == k`, the output matches the expected format ("YES", 1, 1).
   - For the case when `n < k`, the output matches the expected format ("NO").
   - For the case when `n >= k`, the output matches the expected format ("YES", 2, n - k + 1, 1).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is exactly `k`.
   - The function correctly handles the case where `n` is less than `k`.
   - The function correctly handles the case where `n` is greater than or equal to `k` and prints the appropriate number of stalls and prices.

4. **Stall Limitation**:
   - The function does not exceed the limit of 60 stalls, as it only uses 1 or 2 stalls depending on the conditions.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1(n, k)` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and produces the correct outputs for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
