Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `costs` is a list containing two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - `h` is the sum of `n` divided by each value in `costs`, i.e., `h = n // (n - k + 1) + n // 1`.
   - `h` is also stated to be greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(*costs)
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The `*costs` syntax in the `print` function unpacks the list `costs` and prints its elements separated by spaces.
   - Since `costs` is explicitly defined as `[n - k + 1, 1]`, the elements to be printed are `n - k + 1` and `1`.

Therefore, the output will be the elements of the list `costs` printed as `n - k + 1 1`.

Output: **n - k + 1 1**
