### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary step-by-step to verify the original assessment.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
The function `func_1`:
1. Checks if `n` equals `k`. If true, it prints "YES", 1, and 1 and returns `n` (or `k`).
2. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints "NO" and returns `None`.
3. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates the sum of `n` divided by each value in the list `[n - k + 1, 1]` and stores it in `h`. If `h` is less than `k`, it prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES", 2, and the values in the list `[n - k + 1, 1]`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Handling `n == k`:**
   - The program correctly prints "YES" and 1, 1 when `n == k`. However, it should also return `None` instead of `n` (or `k`).

2. **Handling `n < k`:**
   - The program correctly prints "NO" and returns `None` when `n < k`.

3. **Handling `n >= k`:**
   - The program attempts to set up only 2 stalls, which is incorrect. For example, if `n = 255` and `k = 8`, the program should set up 8 stalls with prices `[128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]`, but it incorrectly prints "NO".

4. **Pricing Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating the prices of the stalls is flawed. It does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. For example, with `n = 255` and `k = 8`, the program should set up 8 stalls with prices `[128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]`, but the current implementation does not achieve this.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of stalls needed exceeds 2, which is insufficient for many cases.
- The logic for determining the prices of the stalls is flawed and does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, specifically in handling the number of stalls and the pricing logic.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the flaws in handling the number of stalls and the pricing logic.
