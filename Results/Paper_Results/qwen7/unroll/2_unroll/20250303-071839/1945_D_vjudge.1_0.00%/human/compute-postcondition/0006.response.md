Output State: **`soma_b` is 0, `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated input, `k` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated input, `lista_A` is a list of n integers obtained from the subsequent space-separated inputs and is reversed, `lista_B` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, and `lista_B` is reversed, `pref` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `pref` to 0. This does not affect the values of `soma_b`, `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, or `lista_B`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
