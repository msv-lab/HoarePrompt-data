The function accepts two positive integers n and k, along with two lists of integers lista_A and lista_B, each containing n integers. It calculates and returns the minimum value of the expression `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for all indices i in the range from `n-k` to `n-1`. Here, `pref` is the sum of elements in lista_A up to index i where lista_A[i] < lista_B[i], and `soma_b` is the sum of elements in lista_B from index `n-k` to i.
