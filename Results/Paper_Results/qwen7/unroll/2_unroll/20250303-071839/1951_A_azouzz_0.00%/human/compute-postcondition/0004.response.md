Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.**

Given the constraints and the lack of any input parameters in the function definition, the function does not accept any parameters. Since there are no parameters mentioned, the function does not process any input values. The function also does not have any return statement provided, indicating it does not return any value. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept no parameters and return nothing.
