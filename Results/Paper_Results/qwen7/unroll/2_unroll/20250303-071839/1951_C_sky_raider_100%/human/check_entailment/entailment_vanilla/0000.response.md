Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` which represent the number of sale days, the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, and the number of tickets to be bought at the end.
   - It then reads the list of ticket prices `a` for each of the `n` days.

2. **Sorting the List:**
   - The program sorts the list of ticket prices `l`. This is unnecessary because the algorithm doesn't rely on the order of the prices but rather on the cumulative effect of buying tickets.

3. **Initialization:**
   - Variables `t`, `s`, and `c` are initialized to 0. 
     - `t` likely represents the cumulative increase in price due to previous purchases.
     - `s` is set to the minimum of `m` and `k` at each iteration.
     - `c` accumulates the total cost.

4. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each day.
   - `s` is set to the minimum of `m` and `k`, ensuring no more than `m` tickets are purchased in a single day.
   - The cost for purchasing `s` tickets on the current day is calculated as `s * (l[i] + t)` and added to `c`.
   - `t` is updated by adding `s` to it, representing the increase in price for subsequent days.
   - `k` is decremented by `s`.

5. **Output:**
   - The total cost `c` is printed for each test case.

### Correctness Check

Given the logic and steps above, let's verify if the program meets the requirements:

- The program correctly handles the constraints and logic described in the problem statement.
- The sorting step is unnecessary and can be removed without affecting the outcome since the algorithm relies on cumulative effects rather than the order of prices.
- The main loop correctly implements the logic of buying tickets and updating the price incrementally.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the program, it appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
