Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where purchasing tickets on a given day affects the prices of subsequent days. Specifically, the program does not account for the increase in ticket prices after purchasing tickets on a particular day. 

For example, consider the following input:
- `n = 4`, `m = 2`, `k = 3`
- `a = [1, 3, 8, 4]`

The optimal strategy would be:
1. Buy 2 tickets on the first day with a total cost of `2 * 1 = 2`. Prices for the next days become `[3, 8, 4]`.
2. Buy 1 ticket on the second day with a cost of `1 * 3 = 3`.

The total cost would be `2 + 3 = 5`. However, the program calculates the cost incorrectly, leading to a higher total cost. This is because the program does not update the ticket prices correctly after each purchase.

To fix this, the program needs to update the ticket prices dynamically based on the number of tickets purchased on each day.
