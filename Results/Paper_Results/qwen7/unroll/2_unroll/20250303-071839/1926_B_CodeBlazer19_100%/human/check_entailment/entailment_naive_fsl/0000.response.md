Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. Let's consider a few cases:

1. **Triangle Case**: For a triangle, the grid should have rows with increasing numbers of `1`s centered around a column. However, the program checks if any row has exactly one `1`. If so, it incorrectly identifies it as a triangle. This is incorrect because a triangle can have more than one row with `1`s.

2. **Square Case**: For a square, the grid should have rows with the same number of `1`s positioned symmetrically around the center. The program checks if any row has more than one `1` and sets a flag `b` to `SQUARE`. However, this does not guarantee that the entire grid forms a square. For example, consider the following grid:
   ```
   00000
   00000
   01110
   01110
   00000
   ```
   This grid does not form a square but the program would incorrectly identify it as a square because there are multiple rows with more than one `1`.

To fix this, the program needs to check the structure of the grid to ensure it matches either a triangle or a square. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_triangle(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    for i in range(n):
        ones_count = sum(row[i] for row in grid)
        if ones_count == 0:
            continue
        if ones_count % 2 == 0 or ones_count > 2 * i + 1:
            return False
    return True

def is_square(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    for i in range(n):
        ones_count = sum(row[i] for row in grid)
        if ones_count == 0:
            continue
        if ones_count != n:
            return False
    return True

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        if is_triangle(grid):
            print("TRIANGLE")
        elif is_square(grid):
            print("SQUARE")
        else:
            print("NEITHER")

func()
```

This corrected version checks the structure of the grid to ensure it matches the criteria for a triangle or a square.
