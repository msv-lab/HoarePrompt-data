Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. Here's why:

1. **Triangle Identification**: The logic for identifying a triangle is flawed. The program checks if any row has exactly one '1', which is not sufficient to determine a triangle. A triangle requires specific patterns of '1's in multiple rows, not just one row with a single '1'.

2. **Square Identification**: Similarly, the logic for identifying a square is incomplete. The program checks if any row has more than one '1' but doesn't verify the spacing or the number of rows and columns required for a square.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to implement logic that checks for the specific patterns of a triangle and a square as defined in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def check_triangle(grid, n):
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        # Check if the pattern matches a triangle
        for i in range(n - k + 1):
            if all(grid[i + m][j] == '1' for m in range(k) for j in range(i + m, i + m + 2 * m + 1)):
                return True
    return False

def check_square(grid, n):
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        # Check if the pattern matches a square
        for i in range(n - k + 1):
            for j in range(n - k + 1):
                if all(grid[i + m][j + n // 2 - k // 2 + d] == '1' for m in range(k) for d in range(k)):
                    return True
    return False

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        if check_triangle(grid, n):
            print("TRIANGLE")
        elif check_square(grid, n):
            print("SQUARE")
        else:
            print("NO SHAPE")

func()
```

This corrected program checks for both triangle and square patterns according to the problem definition.
