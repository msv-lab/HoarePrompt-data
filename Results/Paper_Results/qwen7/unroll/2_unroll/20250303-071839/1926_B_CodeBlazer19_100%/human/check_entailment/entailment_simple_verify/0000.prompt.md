You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. Let's consider a few cases:

1. **Triangle Case**: For a triangle, the grid should have rows with increasing numbers of `1`s centered around a column. However, the program checks if any row has exactly one `1`. If so, it incorrectly identifies it as a triangle. This is incorrect because a triangle can have more than one row with `1`s.

2. **Square Case**: For a square, the grid should have rows with the same number of `1`s positioned symmetrically around the center. The program checks if any row has more than one `1` and sets a flag `b` to `SQUARE`. However, this does not guarantee that the entire grid forms a square. For example, consider the following grid:
   ```
   00000
   00000
   01110
   01110
   00000
   ```
   This grid does not form a square but the program would incorrectly identify it as a square because there are multiple rows with more than one `1`.

To fix this, the program needs to check the structure of the grid to ensure it matches either a triangle or a square. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_triangle(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    for i in range(n):
        ones_count = sum(row[i] for row in grid)
        if ones_count == 0:
            continue
        if ones_count % 2 == 0 or ones_count > 2 * i + 1:
            return False
    return True

def is_square(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    for i in range(n):
        ones_count = sum(row[i] for row in grid)
        if ones_count == 0:
            continue
        if ones_count != n:
            return False
    return True

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        if is_triangle(grid):
            print("TRIANGLE")
        elif is_square(grid):
            print("SQUARE")
        else:
            print("NEITHER")

func()
```

This corrected version checks the structure of the grid to ensure it matches the criteria for a triangle or a square.
