### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the problems and verify them using the annotated version and the problem description.

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Shapes:**
   - The program only checks if a row contains exactly one '1' or more than one '1'. This logic is insufficient to identify the shapes correctly.
   - For example, consider a grid that forms a square:
     ```
     00000
     01110
     01010
     01110
     00000
     ```
     The program would incorrectly identify this as a triangle because some rows have more than one '1'.

2. **No Check for Triangle Shape:**
   - The program does not check if the '1's form a triangle shape, which requires checking the positions of the '1's in multiple rows.
   - For example, a triangle with `k=3` would look like:
     ```
     000
     011
     011
     ```
     The program would not recognize this pattern.

3. **No Check for Square Shape:**
   - Similarly, the program does not check if the '1's form a square shape, which requires checking the positions of the '1's in multiple rows.
   - For example, a square with `k=3` would look like:
     ```
     000
     011
     011
     ```
     The program would not recognize this pattern.

Given these issues, the program fails to correctly identify the shapes in the grid. The annotated version confirms that the program only checks for rows with exactly one '1' or more than one '1', which is not sufficient to determine the shape.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly identify the shapes (triangles or squares) in the grid based on the provided problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
