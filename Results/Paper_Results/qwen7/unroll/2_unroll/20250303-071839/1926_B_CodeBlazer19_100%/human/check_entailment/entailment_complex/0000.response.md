Reasoning:

The given program attempts to determine whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. However, there are several issues with the logic implemented in the function:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Triangles and Squares**: 
   - The program checks if any row contains exactly one '1' to determine if the shape is a triangle. This is not sufficient because a triangle can have more than one row with '1's, but they must be aligned in a specific pattern.
   - Similarly, checking if any row contains more than one '1' to determine if the shape is a square is also insufficient. A square can have rows with more than one '1' but they must be evenly spaced.

2. **Incomplete Logic for Determining Shapes**:
   - The program does not properly check the alignment of '1's to form a triangle or a square. For example, a triangle requires that the '1's in each row are centered and increase in count as you move down the rows. A square requires that the '1's in each row are evenly spaced and form a consistent width across the rows.

3. **Potential Missed Cases**:
   - The program might miss cases where the shape is neither a perfect triangle nor a perfect square but still contains all '1's in a grid.

Given these issues, the current implementation will not correctly identify the shapes in all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
