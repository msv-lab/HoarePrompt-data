Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly identifies whether the shape in the grid is a triangle or a square.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.

2. **Identifying Shapes:**
   - The program initializes two variables `a` and `b`:
     - `a` is used to store the result if a triangle is found.
     - `b` is used to store the result if a square is found.
   - For each row in the grid:
     - If a row contains exactly one '1', it sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'.
     - If a row contains more than one '1', it sets `b` to 'SQUARE'.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all rows, if `a` is set, it prints 'TRIANGLE'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'SQUARE'.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Shapes:**
   - The program only checks if a row contains exactly one '1' or more than one '1'. This logic is insufficient to identify the shapes correctly.
   - For example, consider a grid that forms a square:
     ```
     00000
     01110
     01010
     01110
     00000
     ```
     The program would incorrectly identify this as a triangle because some rows have more than one '1'.

2. **No Check for Triangle Shape:**
   - The program does not check if the '1's form a triangle shape, which requires checking the positions of the '1's in multiple rows.
   - For example, a triangle with `k=3` would look like:
     ```
     000
     011
     011
     ```
     The program would not recognize this pattern.

3. **No Check for Square Shape:**
   - Similarly, the program does not check if the '1's form a square shape, which requires checking the positions of the '1's in multiple rows.
   - For example, a square with `k=3` would look like:
     ```
     000
     011
     011
     ```
     The program would not recognize this pattern.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly identify the shapes (triangles or squares) in the grid based on the provided problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
