Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `digits` is a list containing all the digit characters from the original `password` string sorted in ascending order; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the original `password` string.**

The code `digits.sort()` sorts the `digits` list in ascending order. The `letters` list remains unchanged, and the `password` string also remains unchanged.
