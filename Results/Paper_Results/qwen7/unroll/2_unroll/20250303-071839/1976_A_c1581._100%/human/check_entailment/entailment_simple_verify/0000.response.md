### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its annotated version to determine if it correctly verifies whether a password meets the specified criteria.

1. **Function `func_1(password)`**:
   - The function splits the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - It then sorts these lists.
   - After sorting, it checks if any digit is greater than the next digit (which ensures digits are in non-decreasing order).
   - It also checks if the last digit is greater than any letter (ensuring no digit comes after a letter).

2. **Key Points in the Annotated Code**:
   - The function correctly handles the sorting of digits and letters.
   - It ensures that digits are in non-decreasing order.
   - It ensures that no digit comes after a letter by comparing the last digit with the first letter.

3. **Test Cases Analysis**:
   - The provided test cases cover various scenarios:
     - "12ac": Correctly identified as "YES".
     - "123wa": Correctly identified as "NO" because the letters are not sorted.
     - "allllmost": Correctly identified as "YES".
     - "ac123": Correctly identified as "NO" because the digits are not in non-decreasing order.
     - "011679": Correctly identified as "YES".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles passwords with only digits, only letters, or a mix of both.
   - It correctly identifies when digits are out of order or when a digit comes after a letter.

Given the analysis, the function `func_1(password)` correctly implements the required conditions for a strong password. The original assessment was incorrect because it pointed out a flaw that does not exist in the provided code.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
