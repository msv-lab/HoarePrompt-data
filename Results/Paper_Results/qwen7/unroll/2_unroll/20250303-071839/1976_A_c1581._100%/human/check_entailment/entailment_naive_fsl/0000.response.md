Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are consecutive digits in the password that are not sorted in non-decreasing order. For example, consider the password "123a". According to the problem description, this password should be considered invalid because the digits "1", "2", and "3" are already sorted, but the program incorrectly accepts it as valid. This can be seen in the test cases output where "123a" is printed as "YES", which is incorrect.
