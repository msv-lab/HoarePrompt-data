### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes a password string and processes it to check if it meets the criteria for a strong password.
   - It separates the digits and letters into two lists (`digits` and `letters`).
   - It sorts both lists.
   - It then checks if the sorted combination of these lists matches the original password.
   - If the sorted combination matches the original password, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. **Key Checks**:
   - The function ensures that no two consecutive digits in the `digits` list are out of order.
   - The function also checks if the last digit in the `digits` list is not greater than any of the letters in the `letters` list.

3. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function call.
   - They confirm that the function processes the password, sorts the digits and letters, and checks if the sorted combination matches the original password.

4. **Problem Description**:
   - The problem requires that:
     - The password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
     - There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
     - All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
     - All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases show that the function correctly identifies invalid passwords such as "123a" and "ac123".

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic required to verify if a password is strong according to the problem description. The original assessment was incorrect because the function actually handles the case where there are consecutive digits in the password that are not sorted in non-decreasing order correctly. The function ensures that all digits are sorted and checks if the sorted combination matches the original password.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the provided test cases.
