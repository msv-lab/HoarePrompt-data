Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the product of `x` and `y`. The logic in `func_1()` does not ensure that the largest possible digits are swapped between corresponding positions in `x` and `y`. Instead, it only checks if the current digit in `a` is less than the corresponding digit in `b` and swaps them if so. This approach does not guarantee that the product will be maximized.

For example, consider the test case:
```
x = 3516
y = 3982
```
The program would output:
```
3516
3982
```
However, the optimal solution would be to swap the second and third digits:
```
x = 3916
y = 3582
```
This results in a larger product. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality.
