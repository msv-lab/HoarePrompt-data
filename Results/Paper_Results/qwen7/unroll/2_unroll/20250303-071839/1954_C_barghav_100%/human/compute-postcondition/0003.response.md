Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `len(a)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is the loop counter, and it starts at 0.
   - `len(a)` is the length of the list `a`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`. Therefore, the loop will run at least once if `len(a)` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` should be set to 0 (the starting value).
   - `len(a)` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

5. **Consider the other given variables (`f`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`)**: These variables are not directly involved in the loop condition and their values do not affect whether the loop will execute. They can remain unchanged.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `len(a)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `len(a)` must be greater than 0**
