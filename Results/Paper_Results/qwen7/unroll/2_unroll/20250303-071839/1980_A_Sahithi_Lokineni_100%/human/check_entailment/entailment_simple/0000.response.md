### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. It also correctly parses `n` and `m` for each test case and reads the string `s`.

2. **Initialization of Dictionary**: A dictionary `d` is initialized with default values for keys 'A' through 'G'. This is done to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the input string `s`.

3. **Counting Problem Difficulties**: The program correctly counts the occurrences of each difficulty level in the input string `s` using a loop.

4. **Calculating Missing Problems**: For each difficulty level, the program checks if the count of problems is less than or equal to `m`. If it is, it calculates the number of additional problems needed for that difficulty level. This calculation is done correctly by subtracting the current count from `m` and adding the result to `ans`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the total number of additional problems required for all difficulty levels, which is stored in `ans`.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic appears to be correct. The program handles the constraints and requirements specified in the problem statement accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
