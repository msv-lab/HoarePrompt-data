Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ `u`, `v` ≤ `n`, `n` is an integer input from the user, and `tree` is an empty deque.**

The code initializes an empty deque named `tree`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `u`, `v`, or `n`. The values of `t`, `u`, `v`, and `n` remain as they were updated from the user input.
