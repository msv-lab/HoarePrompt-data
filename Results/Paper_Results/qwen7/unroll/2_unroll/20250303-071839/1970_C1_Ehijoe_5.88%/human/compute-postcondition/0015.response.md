Postcondition: `empty` is False, `t` is an input integer, `u` is `min(t, idx)`, `v` is `min(t, n - idx - 1)`, `n` is an integer input from the user, `tree` is a deque with elements added based on the given conditions, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in the deque `tree`. If there exists at least one move in `moves` which is odd, then no specific changes are mentioned. If all moves in `moves` are even numbers, then no specific changes are mentioned as well.
