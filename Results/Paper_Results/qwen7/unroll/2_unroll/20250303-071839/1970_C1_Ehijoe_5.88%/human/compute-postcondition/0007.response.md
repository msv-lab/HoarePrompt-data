Output State: **`empty` is False, `t` is an input integer, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ `u`, `v` ≤ `n`, `n` is an integer input from the user, `tree` is a deque with elements added based on the given conditions, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in the deque `tree`.**

The code `idx = tree.index(start)` finds the index of the `start` element within the deque `tree` and assigns it to the variable `idx`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. The initial conditions regarding `empty`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `n`, and `tree` remain valid.
