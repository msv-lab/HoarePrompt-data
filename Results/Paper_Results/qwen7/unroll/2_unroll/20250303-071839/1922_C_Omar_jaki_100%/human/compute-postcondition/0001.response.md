Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a is a list of n integers in strictly increasing order (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9), m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and queries is a list of m pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, r is a lambda function that maps integers from input split by spaces, t is the first integer input using the lambda function r().**

The code `t, = r()` assigns the first integer from the input, split by spaces, to the variable `t`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
