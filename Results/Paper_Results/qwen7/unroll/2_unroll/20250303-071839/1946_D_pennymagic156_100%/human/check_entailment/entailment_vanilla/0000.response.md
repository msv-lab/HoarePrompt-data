### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x` using `func_1()`, which is correct.
   - It then reads the array `a` using `func_1()`.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The function `func_5()` iterates over the bits from 29 down to 0 (since `x` is a 30-bit number).
   - For each bit position `i`:
     - It checks if both `u` (the `i`-th bit of `x`) and `v` (the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`) are zero. If so, it continues to the next bit.
     - If `u` is zero and `v` is odd, it returns the current answer `ans` because this configuration cannot form valid segments.
     - If `u` is zero and `v` is even, it processes the array to split it into segments where the XOR of the `i`-th bits is zero.
     - If `u` is one and `v` is odd, it skips to the next iteration.
     - If `u` is one and `v` is even, it counts the number of segments where the XOR of the `i`-th bits is zero.
     - If `u` is one and `v` is zero, it breaks out of the loop since no further segments can be formed.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `v` is zero and `u` is one by breaking out of the loop, ensuring no further segments are considered.
   - The final result is the maximum count of segments found or the length of the array if no valid segments are found.

4. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the maximum number of segments `k` or `-1` if no valid segments exist.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all the specified conditions and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
