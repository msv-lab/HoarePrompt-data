You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, x) is a tuple of two integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ x < 2^30; a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30.
def func_5():
    n, x = func_3()
    a = func_1()
    t, ans = [], -1
    for i in range(29, -1, -1):
        u, v = x >> i & 1, sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])
        
        if u == v == 0:
            continue
        
        if u == 0:
            if v % 2:
                return ans
            else:
                op = ai = 0
                for val in a:
                    op ^= val >> i & 1
                    ai ^= val
                    if not op:
                        t.append(ai)
                        ai = 0
                a, t = t, []
        elif v % 2:
            continue
        elif v:
            op = cnt = 0
            for val in a:
                op ^= val >> i & 1
                if not op:
                    cnt += 1
            ans = max(ans, cnt)
        else:
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an empty list, `ans` is the maximum count of consecutive 1s found in the binary representation of the elements in `a` for each bit position from 29 to 0, `n` is a value between 1 and 100000, `x` is an integer between 0 and 2^30 - 1, `a` is the return value of `func_1()`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over bit positions from 29 to 0. For each bit position, it checks the bit values of `x` and the elements in `a`. If both bits are 0, it skips. If the bit in `x` is 0 and the corresponding bit in `a`'s sum is odd, it returns `ans`. If the bit in `x` is 0 and the corresponding bit in `a`'s sum is even, it performs some operations on `a` and updates `t`. If the bit in `x` is 1 and the corresponding bit in `a`'s sum is odd, it skips. If the bit in `x` is 1 and the corresponding bit in `a`'s sum is even, it calculates the maximum count of consecutive 1s found in the binary representation of the elements in `a` for that bit position and updates `ans`. If the bit in `x` is 1 and the corresponding bit in `a`'s sum is 0, it breaks the loop. After the loop, `t` remains empty, `ans` contains the maximum count of consecutive 1s, and other variables retain their original values.
    return max(ans, len(a))
    #The program returns the maximum value between ans (which is the maximum count of consecutive 1s found in the binary representation of the elements in a for each bit position from 29 to 0) and the length of the list a.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but works on predefined variables (n, x) and a list a. It calculates the maximum count of consecutive 1s found in the binary representation of the elements in a for each bit position from 29 to 0, then returns the maximum value between this count and the length of the list a.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the maximum value between ans (which is the maximum count of consecutive 1s found in the binary representation of the elements in a for each bit position from 29 to 0) and the length of the list a.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
