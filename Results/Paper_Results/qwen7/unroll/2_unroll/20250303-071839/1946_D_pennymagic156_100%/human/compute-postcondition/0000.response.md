Output State: **`n` is a value between 1 and 100000, `x` is an integer between 0 and 2^30 - 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n, x = func_3()` calls the function `func_3()`, which returns two values. These values are assigned to `n` and `x`. Since the exact implementation of `func_3()` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific values of `n` and `x`, but we know that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100000, and `x` is an integer between 0 and 2^30 - 1. All other information from the initial state remains unchanged.
